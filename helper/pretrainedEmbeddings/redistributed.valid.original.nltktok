Then never man was man true .
The day , my friends , and all things stay for me .
First , I ask thee what they have done ; thirdly , I ask thee what's their offense ; sixth and lastly , why they are committed ; and , to conclude , what you lay to their charge .
Make that good .
Were it not better , Because that I am more than common tall , That I did suit me all points like a man ?
Oh , these flaws and starts , Impostors to true fear , would well become A woman's story at a winter's fire , Authorized by her grandam .
The wine she drinks is made of grapes .
Methinks your maw , like mine , should be your clock , And strike you home without a messenger .
His forward voice now is to speak well of his friend .
I pray you tell me your remedy .
I pray you , have a continent forbearance till the speed of his rage goes slower .
The king , sir , hath laid that in a dozen passes between yourself and him , he shall not exceed you three hits .
Remain thou still in darkness .
With all my heart , and it doth much content me To hear him so inclined .
Come , talk not of her .
Do so .
But what see I ?
Give me my principal , and let me go .
And , sir , tonight I do entreat that we may sup together .
Nothing extenuate , Nor set down aught in malice .
She give it Cassio ?
And I .
Wouldst thou give 'em all ?
Get thee hence .
In troth , I think I should , and undo 't when I had done .
Let me see .
The Moor already changes with my poison .
List a brief tale , And when 'tis told , oh , that my heart would burst !
For if such actions may have passage free , Bond-slaves and pagans shall our statesmen be .
I would cure you if you would but call me Rosalind and come every day to my cote and woo me .
Thou hast frighted the word out of his right sense , so forcible is thy wit .
The son is fled .
Up to some scaffold , there to lose their heads .
Who then shall blame His pestered senses to recoil and start , When all that is within him does condemn Itself for being there ?
Didst thou see any thing ?
May 't please your highness sit .
I wish him joy of her .
When are you married , madam ?
My lord , most humbly on my knee I beg The leading of the vaward .
Fore heaven , they have given me a rouse already .
Sweetly in force unto her fair life's end .
Dry up in her the organs of increase , And from her derogate body never spring A babe to honor her .
Can you tell me whether one Launcelot that dwells with him , dwell with him or no ?
Tis the time's plague when madmen lead the blind .
Prithee , who is 't that thou mean'st ?
It was a vision fair and fortunate .
For every minute is expectancy Of more arrivance .
What's the matter ?
And I have built Two chantries where the sad and solemn priests Sing still for Richard's soul .
A most poor man made tame to fortune's blows , Who by the art of known and feeling sorrows Am pregnant to good pity .
Hark !
Why , what's the matter ?
Courage , man .
Both your majesties Might , by the sovereign power you have of us , Put your dread pleasures more into command Than to entreaty .
O you mighty gods , This world I do renounce , and in your sights Shake patiently my great affliction off .
Art thou learned ?
Is he not able to discharge the money ?
As I suck blood , I will some mercy show .
Such as she says my lord did say I was .
But I'll amerce you with so strong a fine That you shall all repent the loss of mine .
Why dost thou use me thus ?
My lady charged my duty in this business .
His son was but a ward two years ago .
Have you not read , Roderigo , Of some such thing ?
Adieu , good Queen .
Why , you speak like an ancient and most quiet watchman , for I can not see how sleeping should offend .
What you have charged me with , that have I done , And more , much more .
Be witness to me , O thou blessed moon , When men revolted shall upon record Bear hateful memory , poor Enobarbus did Before thy face repent .
What did he when thou saw'st him ?
What fool is this ?
Was Milan thrust from Milan , that his issue Should become kings of Naples ?
I pray God he be not , I say .
Methinks they are such a gentle nation that , but for the mountain of mad flesh
We must obey the time .
Is that the naked fellow ?
This gentleman will out-talk us all .
Do not go forth today .
Would that he were gone !
Alas , he faints !
I have brought you from Venice .
Not altogether so , sir .
Nor I , my lord .
Take thy forfeiture .
What would my lord ?
Prithee , peace .
Men's eyes were made to look and let them gaze .
But , Audrey , there is a youth here in the forest lays claim to you .
How dost thou like the Lord Bassanio's wife ?
Well , keep me company but two years more , Thou shalt not know the sound of thine own tongue .
Honest Iago Hath ta'en order for 't .
Dead ?
Let's speak to him .
Noble captain , come .
Are we all met ?
Our separation so abides and flies That thou , residing here , goes yet with me , And I , hence fleeting , here remain with thee .
Shall I do that which all the Parthian darts , Though enemy , lost aim and could not ?
One speech in it I chiefly loved .
Whom should I knock ?
What , frighted with false fire ?
Soldiers , have careful watch .
Where is gentle Rivers , Vaughan , Grey ?
I thank your lordship , you have got me one .
Now gods that we adore , whereof comes this ?
O Antony , O thou Arabian bird !
O , good my lord , tax not so bad a voice To slander music anymore than once .
But are my brother's powers set forth ?
Nay , we must think men are not gods , Nor of them look for such observances As fit the bridal .
Sweet mistress , what your name is else I know not , Nor by what wonder you do hit of mine , ,
Ho , open the door .
They stumble that run fast .
How many , as you guess ?
And there she shall at Friar Lawrence ' cell Be shrived and married .
Marry , thou dost wrong me , thou dissembler , thou .
He's worth no more .
Hark , how these instruments summon to supper .
His folly , Helena , is no fault of mine .
Caliban !
As thou'rt a man , Give me the cup .
I have made strong proof of my constancy , Giving myself a voluntary wound Here in the thigh .
Kneel to the duke before he pass the abbey .
I will neither be faced nor braved .
Lady , you come hither to be married to this count ?
Every inordinate cup is unblessed and the ingredient is a devil .
Sayest thou that house is dark ?
Yet again ?
A very dishonest paltry boy , and more a coward than a hare .
I never saw the chain , so help me heaven , And this is false you burden me withal .
This is a man , old , wrinkled , faded , withered , And not a maiden , as thou say'st he is .
That I ask again , For nothing can be ill if she be well .
Come , march to wakes and fairs and market towns .
O my follies !
She made good view of me , indeed so much That sure methought her eyes had lost her tongue , For she did speak in starts distractedly .
You have it full , Benedick .
Marry , here's grace and a codpiece , that's a wise man and a fool .
Oh , then belike you fancy riches more .
And , as the jest did glance away from me , 'T is ten to one it maimed you two outright .
He's a traitor .
Speak softly .
This is not the way To win your daughter .
Will you dine with me tomorrow ?
Most shallow man .
Why should I not ?
No , trust me , sir , nor I. I am sure thou dost .
I will run , fiend .
It is called Wye at Monmouth , but it is out of my prains what is the name of the other river .
Tis even so , For let our finger ache and it endues Our other healthful members even to that sense Of pain .
I never felt it till now , Two thousand ducats in that , and other precious , precious jewels .
You , Roderigo !
Were I my father , coz , would I do this ?
Will 't please your highness walk ?
I will deny thee nothing !
Your accent is something finer than you could purchase in so removed a dwelling .
Upon a lie seven times removed. , Bear your body more seeming , Audrey. , As thus , sir : I did dislike the cut of a certain courtier's beard .
Dost thou understand me , man ?
Though we have spent our harvest of this king , We are to reap the harvest of his son .
Her blood is settled , and her joints are stiff .
It shall not need .
Is supper ready , the house trimmed , rushes strewed , cobwebs swept , the servingmen in their new fustian , their white stockings , and every officer his wedding garment on ?
Stood the state so ?
For women are as roses , whose fair flower Being once displayed , doth fall that very hour .
I thank thee for thy care and honest pains .
Welcome , my friends all .
Makest thou this shame thy pastime ?
See , Caesar !
But I will tell you at some meeter season .
I prithee now , ungird thy strangeness and tell me what I shall vent to my lady .
But 'tis strange .
The queen , my lord , is dead .
Coraggio , bully-monster , If these be true spies which I wear in my head , here's a goodly sight .
A plague upon this howling !
The will !
Antony Did tell me of you , bade me trust you , but I do not greatly care to be deceived , That have no use for trusting .
Husband , I'll dine above with you today , And shrive you of a thousand idle pranks .
In faith , hath not the world one man but he will wear his cap with suspicion ?
And on the answer , he pays you as surely as your feet hit the ground they step on .
Alack , what noise is this ?
And , for his passage , The soldiers ' music and the rites of war Speak loudly for him .
Now near enough .
Like aqua vitae with a midwife .
Not so , sir , I do care for something .
No , let me know , And knowing what I am , I know what she shall be .
A piece of work that will make sick men whole .
Now , by the world , it is a lusty wench .
Ay , if the fool could find it where it lies .
Tell me where it is .
No ?
I will discharge thee ere I go from thee .
Will you mock at an ancient tradition begun upon an honorable respect and worn as a memorable trophy of predeceased valor , and dare not avouch in your deeds any of your words ?
I grant I am a woman , but withal A woman that Lord Brutus took to wife .
Death , traitor !
Good morrow , General .
O sirs , consider : they that set you on To do this deed will hate you for the deed .
Nor I neither , by this heavenly light .
Where is thy power , then , to beat him back ?
Let but the commons hear this testament , Which , pardon me , I do not mean to read , And they would go and kiss dead Caesar's wounds And dip their napkins in his sacred blood , Yea , beg a hair of him for memory , And , dying , mention it within their wills , Bequeathing it as a rich legacy Unto their issue .
And speak parrot ?
Be thou a spirit of health or goblin damned , Bring with thee airs from heaven or blasts from hell , Be thy intents wicked or charitable , Thou comest in such a questionable shape That I will speak to thee .
In honest plainness thou hast heard me say My daughter is not for thee .
Nay , it is .
Thy shape invisible retain thou still .
Here comes his Majesty .
My arm is sore .
Call you ?
If there be more , more woeful , hold it in .
I have not dined today .
My Queen and Eros Have by their brave instruction got upon me A nobleness in record .
I am but hurt .
Do not torment me .
John Duke of Norfolk , Thomas Earl of Surrey , Shall have the leading of this foot and horse .
He sent me word if I said his beard was not cut well , he was in the mind it was .
And so will I .
One kiss , and I'll descend .
That goldsmith there , were he not packed with her , Could witness it , for he was with me then , Who parted with me to go fetch a chain , Promising to bring it to the Porpentine , Where Balthasar and I did dine together .
Miscreant !
Hadst thou no poison mixed , no sharp-ground knife , No sudden mean of death , though ne'er so mean , But "banished" to kill me ? , "Banished" !
Nay , but who is it ?
He'll make your Paris Louvre shake for it , Were it the mistress court of mighty Europe .
So , so , so .
Give me your arm .
With robbers ' hands my hospitable favors You should not ruffle thus .
The sorrow that I have by right is yours , And all the pleasures you usurp are mine .
How , will she none ?
My noble uncle , do you know the cause ?
I say I will make him eat some part of my leek , or I will peat his pate four days. , Bite , I pray you .
Is there any ships put forth tonight ?
Foul words is but foul wind , and foul wind is but foul breath , and foul breath is noisome .
O , she that might have intercepted thee , By strangling thee in her accursed womb , From all the slaughters , wretch , that thou hast done .
Happily he's the second time come to them , for they say an old man is twice a child .
But old folks , many feign as they were dead , Unwieldy , slow , heavy , and pale as lead .
My Lord Bassanio , let him have the ring .
Mark Antony , shall we give sign of battle ?
And only in that safety died her brothers .
So fare you well till we shall meet again .
Not so happy , yet much happier .
Another hit .
But either it was different in blood ,
Pray heaven I be deceived in you .
But thou with mildness entertain'st thy wooers , With gentle conference , soft and affable .
And what of him , Tranio ?
Why , how now , Juliet ?
Have I not reason , beldams as you are ?
Good your highness , patience .
It is as easy as lying .
You have little cause to say so .
He shall think , by the letters that thou wilt drop , that they come from my niece , and that she's in love with him .
You'll pay me the eight shillings I won of you at betting ?
Go , you cot-quean , go .
Nod to him , elves , and do him courtesies .
Yet leave our cousin Katherine here with us .
When we are born , we cry that we are come To this great stage of fools .
Against my soul's pure truth why labour you To make it wander in an unknown field ?
Ay , with Cassio .
Abhorred villain !
Yours in the ranks of death .
Where I have learned me to repent the sin Of disobedient opposition To you and your behests , and am enjoined By holy Lawrence to fall prostrate here To beg your pardon .
Marry , I fare well , For here is cheer enough .
Scape being drunk for want of wine .
But , sirrah , mark , we use To say the dead are well .
Hear you , sir ?
Ay , let her rot and perish and be damned tonight , for she shall not live .
I know that we shall have him well to friend .
Oh , what a goodly outside falsehood hath !
Her husband , sirrah ?
What warlike noise is this ?
Awake remembrance of these valiant dead And with your puissant arm renew their feats .
Ay , my liege , so please you give us leave .
Answer me in one word .
False justicer , why hast thou let her 'scape ?
Why so , being gone , Why so , being gone , I am a man again .
Ah keeper , keeper , I have done those things , That now give evidence against my soul , For Edward's sake , and see how he requites me. , O God , if my deep prayers can not appease thee , But thou wilt be avenged on my misdeeds , Yet execute thy wrath in me alone !
Things have fall'n out , sir , so unluckily , That we have had no time to move our daughter .
Marry , I would not do such a thing for a joint-ring , nor for measures of lawn , nor for gowns , petticoats , nor caps , nor any petty exhibition .
You should hear reason .
I pray you , pass with your best violence .
By your most gracious pardon , I sing but after you .
And mine , two hundred .
Therefore my age is as a lusty winter , Frosty but kindly .
He tells me flatly there is no mercy for me in heaven because I am a Jew's daughter , and he says you are no good member of the commonwealth , for in converting Jews to Christians you raise the price of pork .
How far that little candle throws his beams !
Reserve them till a merrier hour than this .
My wits faints .
He doth entreat your Grace , my noble lord , To visit him tomorrow or next day .
Am not I Christopher Sly , old Sly's son of Burton Heath , by birth a peddler , by education a cardmaker , by transmutation a bearherd , and now by present profession a tinker ?
She that , so young , could give out such a seeming , To seel her father's eyes up close as oak , He thought 'twas witchcraft .
Sailors , my lord , they say .
Trip , Audrey , trip , Audrey. , I attend , I attend .
If you shall cleave to my consent , when 'tis , It shall make honor for you .
I have not seen him this two days .
Ha !
And therefore , like herself , wise , fair and true , Shall she be placed in my constant soul .
With drinking healths to my niece .
Not Cassio killed !
Thou hast taken against me a most just exception , but yet I protest I have dealt most directly in thy affair .
Those that have known the earth so full of faults .
We will go together .
Begone. , On , officer , to prison till it come .
Gratiano speaks an infinite deal of nothing , more than any man in all Venice .
And , as thou badest me , In troops I have dispersed them 'bout the isle .
What's that , I pray ?
He's married .
I know my lady will strike him .
I had rather have a handful or two of dried peas .
You rise to play and go to bed to work .
Murder and treason !
Nay , hear them , Antony .
I pray thee , get us some excellent music , for tomorrow night we would have it at the Lady Hero's chamber window
But is all this for your father ?
Whereby hangs a tale , sir ?
Is your name Shylock ?
Brother , my lord the duke , Stand to and do as we .
Can any of your neighbors tell , Kate ?
And yet it is not : it is but so-so .
Farewell .
Am I Dromio ?
Could beauty , my lord , have better commerce than with honesty ?
Of one whose hand , Like the base Indian , threw a pearl away Richer than all his tribe .
Methinks our garments are now as fresh as when we put them on first in Afric , at the marriage of the king's fair daughter Claribel to the King of Tunis .
Ay , in the temple , in the town , the field You do me mischief .
O cousin , cousin !
Tis here .
The bounty and the benison of heaven To boot and boot .
Do you hear , you minion ?
Why , the enemy is loud .
Marry , and did .
Assume a virtue if you have it not .
I say amen , Gonzalo .
How does lieutenant Cassio ?
For she is wise , if I can judge of her .
Alas , thou hast misconstrued everything !
Thou shouldst know There were a heart in Egypt .
God grant that some , less noble and less loyal , Nearer in bloody thoughts , and not in blood , Deserve not worse than wretched Clarence did , And yet go current from suspicion .
Self-love , my liege , is not so vile a sin As self-neglecting .
O heavy day !
Help , help , O , help !
My lord , good morrow .
So , thanks to all at once and to each one , Whom we invite to see us crowned at Scone .
Make those that do offend you suffer too .
Madman , thou errest .
You English princes all , I do salute you .
If she will return me my jewels I will give over my suit and repent my unlawful solicitation .
Touching this vision here , It is an honest ghost , that let me tell you .
A very mean meaning .
Ay me , it is my husband .
This wedding day Perhaps is but prolonged .
What , wouldst thou have me go and beg my food , Or with a base and boist'rous sword enforce A thievish living on the common road ?
I will here shroud till the dregs of the storm be past .
Thou canst not .
I thank you , sir .
There is no love in you .
And if you leave me so , you do me wrong .
The gods best know , Oh never was there queen So mightily betrayed !
O , lady , lady , shame would have it hid .
Do you bite your thumb at us , sir ?
So hath my lord dared him to single fight .
Or who pronounced The bitter sentence of poor Clarence ' death Before I be convict by course of law ?
Security gives way to conspiracy .
Fortune is merry , And in this mood will give us anything .
Wilt thou be lord of the whole world ?
What sum owes he the Jew ?
Goodly Lord , what a wit-snapper are you !
Her father's brother Would be her lord ?
But let them measure us by what they will .
They are loves I bear to you .
Hath put himself from rest , And must needs taste his folly .
Under this conjuration , speak , my lord , For we will hear , note , and believe in heart That what you speak is in your conscience washed As pure as sin with baptism .
To cry "Amen" to that , thus we appear .
And when goes hence ?
Hold him in safety till the Prince come hither .
Ay , ay .
Therefore know I have earned of Don John a thousand ducats .
And as our vineyards , fallows , meads , and hedges , Defective in their natures , grow to wildness , Even so our houses and ourselves and children Have lost , or do not learn for want of time , The sciences that should become our country , But grow like savages , as soldiers will
Kill Claudio .
There is a lord will hear you play tonight ; But I am doubtful of your modesties , Lest over-eyeing of his odd behavior , For yet his Honor never heard a play , You break into some merry passion And so offend him .
Marry , will I , sir .
If my lady have not called up her steward Malvolio and bid him turn you out of doors , never trust me .
Robin Starveling , the tailor ?
Come , come .
Will it eat me ?
Therefore away , to get our stuff aboard .
Fear it , Ophelia .
Both of you Know Banquo was your enemy .
I tell thee , I am as well in my wits as any man in Illyria .
God grant him health .
Liberty !
This night methinks is but the daylight sick .
As ever you come of women , come in quickly to Sir John .
Therefore , merchant , I'll limit thee this day To seek thy life by beneficial help .
O , my fair cousin , I must not say so .
And what have I to give you back whose worth May counterpoise this rich and precious gift ?
Saint Davy's day is past .
O Cassius , I am sick of many griefs .
And they have been grand-jurymen since before Noah was a sailor .
Hence , horrible villain , or I'll spurn thine eyes Like balls before me !
Not I , my lord .
How , how , how , how ?
Our duty to your honor .
Knock , knock , knock !
I go , I go .
Is it his use ?
I love you with so much of my heart that none is left to protest .
Who , he ?
Go in , Nerissa .
Most heavy day !
O God , Horatio , what a wounded name , Things standing thus unknown , shall live behind me !
O piteous spectacle !
Lead me to my chamber .
Let floods o'erswell and fiends for food howl on !
But soft , but soft a while .
My leisure serves me , pensive daughter , now. , My lord , we must entreat the time alone .
Even so lies she , Blubbering and weeping , weeping and blubbering .
None at all .
Let me deal in this .
Stand fast together , lest some friend of Caesar's Should chance , Talk not of standing. , Publius , good cheer .
It is , and wants but nomination .
Why , go to bed , and sleep .
Thou baggage , let me in .
Your answer to that ?
Thou art Dromio , thou art my man , thou art thyself .
I know his heart .
I will , my lord .
Decius Brutus loves thee not .
And if thy poor devoted servant may But beg one favor at thy gracious hand , Thou dost confirm his happiness forever .
I shall be pinched to death .
What make you from home ?
You have been nobly borne .
Now might I do it pat .
Nothing , my lord .
See how they kiss and court !
Why prat'st thou to thyself and answer'st not ?
But , sir , forgive me , Since my becomings kill me when they do not Eye well to you .
Too well , too well .
I go to take my stand To see him pass on to the Capitol .
What , was I married to her in my dream ?
What is decreed must be , and be this so .
Good signior , you shall more command with years Than with your weapons .
I will look him and privily relieve him .
Who , I ?
But no more deep will I endart mine eye Than your consent gives strength to make it fly .
Inform her full of my particular fear , And thereto add such reasons of your own As may compact it more .
I will not be long from you .
Look , and thou shalt see .
Our fortune on the sea is out of breath And sinks most lamentably .
I pray you , keep it in .
And every object that might make me fear Misfortune to my ventures out of doubt Would make me sad .
Stand you both forth now : stroke your chins and swear by your beards that I am a knave .
Let him cry , "Praise and glory on his head ! " For forth he goes and visits all his host , Bids them good morrow with a modest smile , And calls them brothers , friends , and countrymen .
The old priest at Saint Luke's Church is at your command at all hours .
Is the storm overblown ?
There's knocking at the gate .
I will none of your money .
Well , what was yours ?
Fie , that you'll say so !
At land , thou know'st How much we do o'ercount thee .
And ere I take this charm from of her sight , As I can take it with another herb , I'll make her render up her page to me .
You have put him down , lady , you have put him down .
To anger him , we'll have the bear again , and we will fool him black and blue .
Hang him , foul collier !
Why , so .
A noble duke , in nature As in name .
What promise , chuck ?
We'll set thee to school to an ant to teach thee there's no laboring i ' th ' winter .
I tell thee , Litio , this is wonderful !
Farewell , therefore , Hero .
Have at you now !
Strike on the tinder , ho !
I am glad thy father's dead , Thy match was mortal to him , and pure grief Shore his old thread in twain .
Ay , my lord .
This will prove a brave kingdom to me , where I shall have my music for nothing .
I say she shall. , And first begin with her .
Octavius , then take him to follow thee , That did the latest service to my master .
Drones hive not with me .
Farewell .
What have you , my good friends , deserved at the hands of fortune that she sends you to prison hither ?
Of anything the image tell me that Hath kept with thy remembrance .
Those linen cheeks of thine Are counselors to fear .
Thus we are agreed .
Boatswain !
Let us hear , sweet Bottom .
And so adieu , sir .
Prithee , listen well .
I doubt it not , sir , but you will curse your wooing. , Neighbor , this is a gift very grateful , I am sure of it .
I'll have them sleep on cushions in my tent .
My lord , I can not .
No .
Cursed be I that did so !
But to be frank , and give it thee again .
I Beyond all limit of what else i ' th ' world Do love , prize , honor you .
It is very sultry , as 'twere , I can not tell how .
It is a most sharp sauce .
The food that to him now is as luscious as locusts shall be to him shortly as bitter as coloquintida .
Welcome , good Robin .
Then weigh what loss your honor may sustain If with too credent ear you list his songs , Or lose your heart , or your chaste treasure open To his unmastered importunity .
If they'll do neither , we will come to them And make them skirr away as swift as stones Enforced from the old Assyrian slings .
In me 'tis villainy , In thee 't had been good service .
Is it within reason and compass ?
Anything that's mended is but patched .
If he will not stand when he is bidden , he is none of the Prince's subjects .
But , oh , vain boast !
My Lady Grey his wife , Clarence , 'tis she That tempers him to this extremity .
What news among the merchants ?
Is there a murderer here ?
Here was a Caesar !
So please you .
O most unhappy strumpet !
Thou art thy father's daughter .
True , " said she , "a fine little one." "No , " said I , "a great wit." "Right , " says she , "a great gross one." "Nay , " said I , "a good wit." "Just , " said she , "it hurts nobody." "Nay , " said I , "the gentleman is wise." "Certain , " said she , "a wise gentleman." "Nay , " said I , "he hath the tongues." "That I believe , " said she , "for he swore a thing to me on Monday night , which he forswore on Tuesday morning ; there's a double tongue , there's two tongues." Thus did she an hour together transshape thy particular virtues .
Fellows , let's be gone .
My dukedom to a beggarly denier , I do mistake my person all this while !
Where died she ?
Here , here , sir !
It shall advantage thee more than ever the bearing of letter did .
Ay , sir , the sergeant of the band ; he that brings any man to answer it that breaks his band ; one that thinks a man always going to bed and says "God give you good rest." Well , sir , there rest in your foolery .
Nor doth this wood lack worlds of company , For you in my respect are all the world .
That's most certain , and with you .
And he's gone .
Let me stay the growth of his beard , if thou delay me not the knowledge of his chin .
The poor world is almost six thousand years old , and in all this time there was not any man died in his own person , videlicet , in a love cause .
So I charmed their ears That , calflike , they my lowing followed through Toothed briers , sharp furzes , pricking gorse , and thorns , Which entered their frail shins .
I commanded the sleeves should be cut out and sewed up again , and that I'll prove upon thee , though thy little finger be armed in a thimble .
Is he alone ?
Three proper young men of excellent growth and presence .
Thrice within this hour I saw him down , thrice up again and fighting .
I would do much T ' atone them , for the love I bear to Cassio .
Now , darting Parthia , art thou struck , and now Pleased fortune does of Marcus Crassus' death Make me revenger .
Why , that's the way To fool their preparation and to conquer Their most absurd intents .
No , no , I am as ugly as a bear , For beasts that meet me run away for fear .
Dead .
Thus I let you go And give you to the gods .
Hark .
Take thou some new infection to thy eye , And the rank poison of the old will die .
Come hither , sirrah .
Hie , make haste , Make haste .
Even a toy in hand here , sir .
I can swim like a duck , I'll be sworn .
And so far blameless proves my enterprise , That I have 'nointed an Athenian's eyes .
Very good orators , when they are out , they will spit ; and for lovers lacking , God warn us , matter , the cleanliest shift is to kiss .
Room for Antony , most noble Antony !
Not black in my mind , though yellow in my legs .
I do so , I confess it .
Ay , springes to catch woodcocks .
How dost thou feel thyself now ?
I do require them of you , so to use them As we shall find their merits and our safety May equally determine .
It is Captain Macmorris , is it not ?
Go softly on .
Why , so I do .
I little thought You would have followed .
No , I will be the pattern of all patience .
Caesar sits down in Alexandria , where I will oppose his fate .
Well , well , put up your sword .
I'll make a sop o ' th ' moonshine of you .
What's this ?
I have an interest in your hearts ' proceeding .
Well , well , away .
She is dead .
Methinks his words do from such passion fly , That he believes himself .
Peace , fool .
Alack , why thus ?
Not Hermia but Helena I love .
Let not my worser spirit tempt me again To die before you please .
Fortune is an excellent moral .
Beware the thane of Fife .
A stone-cutter or painter could not have made him so ill though they had been but two years o ' th ' trade .
We see it and will say it .
In cash , most justly paid .
Master , go on , and I will follow thee To the last gasp , with truth and loyalty .
Judge me the world if 'tis not gross in sense That thou hast practiced on her with foul charms , Abused her delicate youth with drugs or minerals That weakens motion .
My mind is changed .
But for the stuffing , well , we are all mortal .
Good Master Mustardseed , I know your patience well .
I met the youthful lord at Lawrence ' cell , And gave him what becomed love I might , Not stepping o'er the bounds of modesty .
Now counterfeit to swoon , why , now fall down ; Or if thou canst not , Oh , for shame , for shame , Lie not , to say mine eyes are murderers .
What are they , beseech your ladyship ?
If you will see it , follow me .
When thou once Wast beaten from Modena , where thou slew'st Hirtius and Pansa , consuls , at thy heel Did famine follow , whom thou fought'st against , Though daintily brought up , with patience more Than savages could suffer .
You will be whipped .
To have a thousand with red burning spits Come hissing in upon 'em !
Abhor it , fear it , do not enter it .
Because my name is George .
Looks he as freshly as he did the day he wrestled ?
This man said , sir , that Don John , the Prince's brother , was a villain .
Tell me your mind .
I swear to thee , youth , by the white hand of Rosalind , I am that he , that unfortunate he .
Here is the cap your Worship did bespeak .
The trick of that voice I do well remember .
And this our life , exempt from public haunt , Finds tongues in trees , books in the running brooks , Sermons in stones , and good in everything .
Come , sit down , every mother's son , and rehearse your parts. , Pyramus , you begin .
Here's the friar ready .
I'll not be far from you .
How "seventh cause" ? , Good my lord , like this fellow .
Therefore , put money in thy purse .
Indeed , he is so .
Follow not .
Cassio , may you suspect Who they should be that have thus mangled you ?
We'll hear him. , Noble Antony , go up .
The cowslips tall her pensioners be .
I will plant you two , and let the fool make a third , where he shall find the letter .
I will speak daggers to her but use none .
Look to my chattels and my movables .
And Cassio killed !
Give him no breath , but now Make boot of his distraction .
Marry , beshrew my hand If it should give your age such cause of fear .
Ay , ay , the cords .
And welcome , welcome !
And wherefore are you gentle , strong , and valiant ?
Alack , alack !
Most noble Empress , you have heard of me ?
Dost thou mock me ?
Meantime we thank you for your well-took labor .
O wife , look how our daughter bleeds !
Here , under leave of Brutus and the rest , For Brutus is an honorable man ; So are they all , all honorable men , Come I to speak in Caesar's funeral .
Marry , they say my uncle grew so fast That he could gnaw a crust at two hours old .
An he should , it were an alms to hang him .
Cry mercy , lords and watchful gentlemen , That you have ta'en a tardy sluggard here .
I will do any modest office , my lord , to help my cousin to a good husband .
I was of late as petty to his ends As is the morn-dew on the myrtle leaf To his grand sea .
And yon tall anchoring bark ,
Answer me like men .
So is he now in execution Of any bold or noble enterprise , However he puts on this tardy form .
What shall I say ?
And when you do them , Cassius , be content .
Shall we rouse the night owl in a catch that will draw three souls out of one weaver ?
Madam , undress you and come now to bed .
I'll follow you .
But soft , I pray you .
Have you got leave to go to shrift today ?
A certain aim he took At a fair vestal throned by the west , And loosed his love shaft smartly from his bow As it should pierce a hundred thousand hearts .
Why , or for what , the nobles were committed Is all unknown to me , my gracious lord .
Yet , if you be out , sir , I can mend you .
We know each other's faces ; for our hearts , He knows no more of mine than I of yours , Or I of his , my lord , than you of mine. , Lord Hastings , you and he are near in love .
Let music sound while he doth make his choice .
Repent but you that you shall lose your friend , And he repents not that he pays your debt .
You have done well by water .
No more , no more .
What , man , courage yet !
In this slumbery agitation , besides her walking and other actual performances , what , at any time , have you heard her say ?
To bed ?
I should have known no less .
If we walk not in the trodden paths our very petticoats will catch them .
Why , what's the matter ?
Give me excess of it that , surfeiting , The appetite may sicken , and so die .
Dolabella !
I will condole in some measure. , To the rest. , Yet my chief humor is for a tyrant .
Pluck but his name out of his heart and turn him going .
Thou never shalt hear herald anymore .
Do not , my lord .
Why , then , some be of laughing , as , ah , ha , he !
Thy woes will make them sharp and pierce like mine .
And what your Highness suffered under that shape , I beseech you take it for your own fault and not mine , for , had you been as I took you for , I made no offense .
Give me your hand .
Let me embrace with old Vincentio , And wander we to see thy honest son , Who will of thy arrival be full joyous .
You lie .
What wert thou if the King of Naples heard thee ?
Oh , let me see thee walk !
God mark thee to his grace !
We are sent To give thee from our royal master thanks , Only to herald thee into his sight , Not pay thee .
Good morrow , old Sir Thomas Erpingham .
Pronounce that sentence then on me , my liege .
Who brought it ?
If then true lovers have been ever crossed , It stands as an edict in destiny .
So is Lysander .
Good counsel , marry .
Thou dost infect mine eyes .
Or Charles or something weaker masters thee .
How durst you , villains , bring it from the dresser And serve it thus to me that love it not ?
What is the matter ?
What noise is that ?
With all my heart , and much it joys me too To see you are become so penitent. , Tressel and Berkeley , go along with me .
And art thou living , Stephano ?
Utter your gravity o'er a gossip's bowl , For here we need it not .
He is most in the company of the right noble Claudio .
Tell Antony Brutus is ta'en .
Thou shalt have nothing but the forfeiture To be so taken at thy peril , Jew .
Tell her I am arrested in the street , And that shall bail me .
I am glad to see your Honor .
But who comes here ?
Pish !
Provoke him that he may .
Away , then .
Whither goest thou ?
Your servants ever Have theirs , themselves , and what is theirs in compt , To make their audit at your highness ' pleasure , Still to return your own .
You do but dally .
Stand there !
Is it for him you do envy me so ?
Lie , With her ?
He shall stay my leisure .
Nay , let's follow him .
What should that bode ?
What else ?
Did you converse , sir , with this gentlewoman ?
We never valued this poor seat of England And therefore , living hence , did give ourself To barbarous license , as 'tis ever common That men are merriest when they are from home .
If it be thus to dream , still let me sleep !
Horrible steep .
I have so often blushed to acknowledge him that now I am brazed to it .
Bring him away .
Stand , ho !
I say , but mark his gesture .
Tonight she is mewed up to her heaviness .
Nay , when I have a suit Wherein I mean to touch your love indeed It shall be full of poise and difficult weight And fearful to be granted .
Room , ho !
What wound did ever heal but by degrees ?
Ah sir , ah sir .
Twere good you do so much for charity .
She returns this ring to you , sir .
And , gentle Puck , take this transformed scalp From off the head of this Athenian swain , That , he awaking when the other do , May all to Athens back again repair And think no more of this night's accidents But as the fierce vexation of a dream .
There's the point .
Verona's summer hath not such a flower .
I will confess to you that I love him .
Then in my tent , Cassius , enlarge your griefs , And I will give you audience .
Comes not that blood as modest evidence To witness simple virtue ?
Promise me life , and I'll confess the truth .
The mercy that was quick in us but late By your own counsel is suppressed and killed .
Advise the duke where you are going , to a most festinate preparation .
Tis since the earthquake now eleven years , And she was weaned , I never shall forget it , Of all the days of the year , upon that day .
This is the night That either makes me or fordoes me quite .
It looks a little paler .
Peace , ho !
What should I answer you ?
Accursed , unhappy , wretched , hateful day !
Thou shalt , I warrant thee .
Will she go now to bed ?
This was a great argument of love in her toward you .
What news , Borachio ?
What , with Lysander ?
Two things provided more : that for this favor He presently become a Christian ; The other , that he do record a gift Here in the court , of all he dies possessed , Unto his son Lorenzo and his daughter .
Good sir , I do in friendship counsel you To leave this place .
You shall hear more by midnight .
Ay , marry , why was he sent into England ?
I can not tell .
My more particular , And that which most with you should safe my going , Is Fulvia's death .
The shame itself doth speak For instant remedy .
Why no , boy .
He's as good at anything and yet a fool .
So indeed he did .
When you have spoken your speech , enter into that brake. , And so everyone according to his cue .
Silence that dreadful bell , it frights the isle From her propriety .
That "fair" again unsay .
By'r Lady , thirty years .
Nothing that I respect , my gracious lord .
Our gracious brother , I will go with them .
You , sir ?
What do I see on thee ?
Ay , past all surgery .
Their villainy goes against my weak stomach , and therefore I must cast it up .
He brushes his hat o ' mornings .
Nay , but he prated And spoke such scurvy and provoking terms Against your honor That , with the little godliness I have , I did full hard forbear him .
I pray you , give me leave to go from hence .
You must say "paragon." A "paramour" is , God bless us , a thing of naught .
I do beseech your Grace , Let me the knowledge of my fault bear with me .
Bid your friends welcome , show a merry cheer .
Your loves , as mine to you .
Where's the king ?
If he have caught the Benedick , it will cost him a thousand pound ere a be cured .
I will not take her on gift of any man .
Your fortunes are alike .
Our brother is imprisoned by your means , Myself disgraced , and the nobility Held in contempt , while great promotions Are daily given to ennoble those That scarce some two days since were worth a noble .
You shall have wine enough , my lord , anon .
But if you fail , without more speech , my lord , You must be gone from hence immediately .
As manhood shall compound .
Indeed , that is out of the air .
His own unkindness That stripped her from his benediction turned her To foreign casualties , gave her dear rights To his dog-hearted daughters .
Thou , my slave , As thou report'st thyself , wast then her servant .
Yes , that thou didst .
Thou hast , Ventidius , that Without the which a soldier and his sword Grants scarce distinction .
I heard him swear his affection .
So shall I clothe me in a forced content , And shut myself up in some other course , To fortune's alms .
Tis strange .
O hard condition , Twin-born with greatness , subject to the breath Of every fool , whose sense no more can feel But his own wringing .
By my troth , sir , no , though it please you to be one of my friends .
For they shall yet belie thy happy years That say thou art a man .
Why is this "impawned , " as you call it ?
Know , sir , that I am called Hortensio .
Goats and monkeys !
Fellow , come from the throng .
Good morrow , good Lieutenant .
Speak , speak .
I would not marry her , though she were endowed with all that Adam had left him before he transgressed .
Tomorrow night when Phoebe doth behold Her silver visage in the watery glass , Decking with liquid pearl the bladed grass ( A time that lovers ' flights doth still conceal ) , Through Athens ' gates have we devised to steal .
This can not anger him .
I thank thee for that gird , good Tranio .
I pray you , then , in love and dear alliance , Let that one article rank with the rest , And thereupon give me your daughter .
O illegitimate construction !
But Macbeth is .
I have , my lord .
Whip me such honest knaves .
Let good Antonio look he keep his day , Or he shall pay for this .
I would not so much as make water but in a sink-a-pace .
I'll follow thee and make a heaven of hell , To die upon the hand I love so well .
Begin these woodbirds but to couple now ?
I am but mad north-north-west .
I was too young that time to value her , But now I know her .
So should the murdered look , and so should I , Pierced through the heart with your stern cruelty .
My Lord of Warwick , here is , praised be God for it , a most contagious treason come to light , look you , as you shall desire in a summer's day .
In your own kingdom , sir .
I'll have grounds More relative than this .
He dies that strikes again .
Old lord , I can not blame thee , Who am myself attached with weariness To th ' dulling of my spirits .
I have not breathed almost since I did see it .
Yet I'll not shed her blood , Nor scar that whiter skin of hers than snow And smooth as monumental alabaster .
I did never know so full a voice issue from so empty a heart .
Oh !
Sir , Octavius is already come to Rome .
Your brother Gloucester hates you .
How came we ashore ?
What less than doomsday is the Prince's doom ?
Yet I insisted ; yet you answered not , But with an angry wafture of your hand Gave sign for me to leave you .
So can I .
I called thee then "vain flourish of my fortune." I called thee then poor shadow , "painted queen , " The presentation of but what I was , The flattering index of a direful pageant , One heaved a-high , to be hurled down below , A mother only mocked with two fair babes , A dream of what thou wast , a garish flag To be the aim of every dangerous shot , A sign of dignity , a breath , a bubble , A queen in jest , only to fill the scene .
What's this for ?
Romeo ! , Alack , alack , what blood is this , which stains The stony entrance of the sepulcher ?
Barnardo has my place .
This is the air , that is the glorious sun .
I believe we must leave the killing out , when all is done .
Therefore no more but to the matter .
Talk not to me .
A more unhappy lady , If this division chance , ne'er stood between , Praying for both parts .
Beg another of thy daughters .
Biondello , what of that ?
Then make a ring about the corpse of Caesar , And let me show you him that made the will .
Oh , I am undone , I am undone !
What stature is she of ?
For , as I am a soldier , A name that in my thoughts becomes me best , If I begin the batt'ry once again , I will not leave the half-achieved Harfleur Till in her ashes she lie buried .
What are you there ?
And at her late being here She gave strange oeillades and most speaking looks To noble Edmund .
Happily met , the happier for thy son .
Gloucester's eyes ?
He's coming hither , now , i ' th ' night , i ' th ' haste , And Regan with him .
I have seen nothing .
Oh , damn her , damn her !
O , reform it altogether !
Return , good Catesby , to the gracious duke .
Make her amends , she weeps .
Tis such another fitchew .
Can not my Lord Stanley sleep these tedious nights ?
Read the will .
Are these things spoken , or do I but dream ?
One thing more rests , that thyself execute , to make one among these wooers .
Briefly , sir .
What , Curio ?
Take away the lady .
His discretion , I am sure , can not carry his valor , for the goose carries not the fox .
She false with Cassio !
In Orsino's bosom .
And what said Surrey then ?
So be it .
And if you wrong us , shall we not revenge ?
Romeo .
Grace grow where those drops fall !
Sir , I do know you , And dare upon the warrant of my note Commend a dear thing to you .
Avaunt , you cullions !
My name is Mary , sir .
In the street I met him , And in his company that gentleman .
Hath not else his eye Stray'd his affection in unlawful love , A sin prevailing much in youthful men Who give their eyes the liberty of gazing ?
Ay , is 't , I warrant him .
My lord ?
She gave it him , and he hath given it his whore .
And buried , gentle Tyrrel ?
Behold , I have a weapon .
I do know him by his gait .
That hath made him mad .
O Cassio , whence came this ?
He passes some humors and careers .
Interrupt the monster one word further , and , by this hand , I'll turn my mercy out o ' doors and make a stockfish of thee .
Tell him myself , the mayor , and aldermen , No less importing than our general good , In deep designs , and matters of great moment Are come to have some conference with his grace .
And then the moon , like to a silver bow New bent in heaven , shall behold the night Of our solemnities .
Why , who would not make her husband a cuckold to make him a monarch ?
Where lies he ?
Ay , my lord .
Twas full two years ere I could get a tooth .
I put it in the pocket of my gown .
They swore that you were almost sick for me .
And so , I pray thee , call Beatrice .
Then call we this the field of Agincourt , Fought on the day of Crispin Crispianus .
I will , my lord .
Make good room .
And this report Hath so exasperated the king that he Prepares for some attempt of war .
Do not approach Till thou dost hear me call .
To cabin , silence !
If I quench thee , thou flaming minister , I can again thy former light restore Should I repent me .
I do desire no more .
What sense had I in her stol'n hours of lust ?
What , my gracious lord ?
Come , Casca , you and I will yet ere day See Brutus at his house .
Hear it apart .
This is above all strangeness .
A braggart , a rogue , a villain that fights by the book of arithmetic !
Now she holds me not .
Let her be thine , for we Have no such daughter , nor shall ever see That face of hers again .
But it would better fit your honor to change your mind .
I have marked A thousand blushing apparitions To start into her face , a thousand innocent shames In angel whiteness beat away those blushes , And in her eye there hath appeared a fire To burn the errors that these princes hold Against her maiden truth .
How fares my noble lord ?
The general and his wife are talking of it , And she speaks for you stoutly .
Think upon Vaughan , and with guilty fear Let fall thy lance .
I here do give thee that with all my heart Which , but thou hast already , with all my heart I would keep from thee .
No more , I pray thee .
O notable strumpet !
After dinner Your hazard shall be made .
And if tomorrow Our navy thrive , I have an absolute hope Our landmen will stand up .
I have nothing with this answer , Hamlet .
O Isis , 'tis impossible .
How now !
What a brazen-faced varlet art thou to deny thou knowest me !
Gentle Mercutio , put thy rapier up .
Go back again and be new beaten home ?
I say thy husband .
Tis even so .
O wonderful , wonderful , and most wonderful wonderful , and yet again wonderful , and after that , out of all whooping !
Who is next ?
We must incline to the king .
Go in with me .
Poor living corse , closed in a dead man's tomb !
What say you to a neat's foot ?
Lovers , make moan .
I hope this passionate humor of mine will change .
And I do with an eye of love requite her .
He was the wretched'st thing when he was young , So long a-growing and so leisurely , That if this rule were true , he should be gracious .
Do it not with poison .
No , by this heavenly light !
Spake you with him ?
Here's a night pities neither wise man nor fool .
Perchance he is not drown'd. , What think you , sailors ?
Well , well , well .
Lysander , speak again !
Romeo , come forth .
If you offend him , I for him defy you .
Oh , my daughter !
When my tongue blabs , then let mine eyes not see .
O hell-kite !
Sir , in my heart there was a kind of fighting That would not let me sleep .
Lady , you know no rules of charity , Which renders good for bad , blessings for curses .
Burn !
O most false love !
Provide your going ; Choose your own company and command what cost Your heart has mind to .
The noble Brutus is ascended .
Tis mine and I will have it .
But those that understood him smiled at one another and shook their heads .
My most exquisite Sir Topas !
Yes .
A devil !
Tis in ourselves that we are thus or thus .
I'll write to him a very taunting letter , And thou shalt bear it .
I told him that your father was at Venice , And that you looked for him this day in Padua .
I know the glove is a glove .
To thee a woman's services are due .
The time has been That , when the brains were out , the man would die , And there an end .
There could I have him now , and there , and there again , and there .
As woman's love .
He is knight , dubbed with unhatched rapier and on carpet consideration , but he is a devil in private brawl .
I will , lady .
What is your will , sir , that you send for me ?
This was his basket .
Why do you speak , too , "Why blame you me to love you ? " ?
Go you , call hither my fool .
Then , if ever thou dar'st acknowledge it , I will make it my quarrel .
Where's the king ?
Rest you merry !
If you are so fond over her iniquity , give her patent to offend , for if it touch not you it comes near nobody .
Oh , heaven , how got she out ?
Alack , for mercy !
Good Corporal Nym , show thy valor and put up your sword .
Mark the music .
Here is a rural fellow That will not be denied your Highness' presence .
Here lie I down and measure out my grave .
Is the chair empty ?
Here we .
Belike they had some notice of the people How I had moved them .
He's coming , madam ; but in very strange manner .
The odds is gone , And there is nothing left remarkable Beneath the visiting moon .
How now , old lad ?
Our master and mistress seeks you .
Lest it make you choleric and purchase me another dry basting .
Now all is well .
That's a certain text .
O Fates , come , come , Cut thread and thrum .
Who could be out , being before his beloved mistress ?
Tis true .
First let me talk with this philosopher. ,
What is your pleasure , madam ?
O damned Iago !
I do beseech you That are of suppler joints , follow them swiftly And hinder them from what this ecstasy May now provoke them to .
Look , in this place ran Cassius ' dagger through .
What man art thou that , thus bescreened in night , So stumblest on my counsel ?
Fool , I say !
Forty thousand brothers Could not with all their quantity of love Make up my sum .
Come , Romeo .
Ay , marry , is 't .
All lost !
By no means" what ?
Your Dane , your German , and your swag-bellied Hollander , Drink , ho ! , are nothing to your English .
Hers you are .
I give it you .
So call the field to rest , and let's away To part the glories of this happy day .
The sight whereof I think you had from me , From Claudio and the Prince .
Fairy King , attend , and mark .
Is that the chain you promised me today ?
Sir , his definement suffers no perdition in you , though I know to divide him inventorially would dizzy th ' arithmetic of memory , and yet but yaw neither , in respect of his quick sail .
And to deal plainly I fear I am not in my perfect mind .
Were I a common laugher , or did use To stale with ordinary oaths my love To every new protester , if you know That I do fawn on men and hug them hard And , after , scandal them , or if you know That I profess myself in banqueting To all the rout , then hold me dangerous .
Trust me , I could do much , Prithee , no more .
There's hell , there's darkness , there's the sulfurous pit , burning , scalding , stench , consumption !
Will you lead , lords ?
Women's gentle brain Could not drop forth such giant-rude invention , Such Ethiop words , blacker in their effect Than in their countenance .
Then he offered it to him again , then he put it by again , but , to my thinking , he was very loath to lay his fingers off it .
Bliss be upon you !
I know you of old .
But he that filches from me my good name Robs me of that which not enriches him And makes me poor indeed .
Fie , how impatience loureth in your face .
Here , sir , but trouble him not .
And there is a forerunner come from a fifth , the Prince of Morocco , who brings word the prince his master will be here tonight .
She has light by her continually .
Tis no such matter .
What wouldst thou , fellow ?
Think not , thou noble Roman , That ever Brutus will go bound to Rome .
I overheard him and his practices .
Lord , what fools these mortals be !
O sir , you are too sure an augurer .
My father was no traitor .
Sir , I shall study deserving .
I do not understand .
Need and oppression starveth in thine eyes .
But , let me see , by ten We shall have each a hundred Englishmen .
Unkindness may do much , And his unkindness may defeat my life , But never taint my love .
What , is Brutus sick , And will he steal out of his wholesome bed , To dare the vile contagion of the night And tempt the rheumy and unpurged air To add unto his sickness ?
Farewell , and if my fortune be not crost , I have a father , you a daughter , lost .
He can not be such a monster , Nor is not , sure .
Wilt thou lift up Olympus ?
Othello's occupation's gone .
Show me , my women , like a queen .
Your hands , come then .
Stands he or sits he ?
The voice of Cassio .
For that he dares us to 't .
Why , so .
The other half comes to the general state , Which humbleness may drive unto a fine .
What , a prisoner ?
Peace !
Your graces are right welcome .
I would not have such a heart in my bosom for the dignity of the whole body .
We will , my noble lord .
Why , one that swears and lies .
He can not like her long .
I stand dishonored , that have gone about To link my dear friend to a common stale .
Tonight I take my leave .
Sheathe your dagger .
Set him before me .
I see a woman may be made a fool If she had not a spirit to resist .
Here comes my noble gull-catcher .
Here .
Madam , I will .
The best and soundest of his time hath been but rash .
Let us on heaps go offer up our lives .
Cunning .
Master , here's The gold you sent me for .
I did , my lord .
He is returned .
And we mean well in going to this mask , But 'tis no wit to go .
And fixed his eyes upon you ?
Run , run , O , run !
Mistress , dispatch you with your safest haste , And get you from our court .
Take thee that too .
A beast , no more .
I can not hope Caesar and Antony shall well greet together .
Plucking the entrails of an offering forth , They could not find a heart within the beast .
There's my cap .
I'll prove mine honor and mine honesty Against thee presently if thou dar'st stand .
I am afeard you make a wanton of me .
I think I told your lordship a year since how much I am in the favor of Margaret , the waiting gentlewoman to Hero .
I have a thing for you .
He , woman .
Tis certain he hath passed the river Somme .
The shrill-gorged lark so far Can not be seen or heard .
A tomb Must cover thy sweet eyes .
I'll go along , no such sight to be shown , But to rejoice in splendor of mine own .
And from thy hated presence part I so .
The worms were hallowed that did breed the silk , And it was dyed in mummy which the skillful Conserved of maidens ' hearts .
Fare thee well !
I took him sleeping , that is finished too , And the Athenian woman by his side , That , when he waked , of force she must be eyed .
My husband , then ?
Now , Catesby , what says your lord to my request ?
Go .
Uncle , I must come forth .
Well thought on .
What wouldst thou write of me , if thou should'st praise me ?
Shall they hoist me up And show me to the shouting varletry Of censuring Rome ?
Will you withdraw ?
Fled this way , sir , when by no means he could , Pursue him , ho !
What's Antony ?
This is well .
If they deny to come , Swinge me them soundly forth unto their husbands .
Seven days and nights ?
Sweet soul , let's in , and there expect their coming .
So they do nothing , 'tis a venial slip .
You knew my father well , and in him me , Left solely heir to all his lands and goods , Which I have bettered rather than decreased .
She knows the heat of a luxurious bed .
Tell me , good Brutus , can you see your face ?
Then have my lips the sin that they have took .
But I am constant as the northern star , Of whose true-fixed and resting quality There is no fellow in the firmament .
Show me which way .
Wherefore !
Young Romeo is it ?
The competitors enter .
She's dead too , our sovereign .

Alas , who knows ?
Why should calamity be full of words ?
Forever and a day .

I remember him well , and I remember him worthy of thy praise .
I'll go and chat with Paris .
Romeo !
She did show favor to the youth in your sight only to exasperate you , to awake your dormouse valor , to put fire in your heart and brimstone in your liver .
But now mine eyes , Which I have darted at thee , hurt thee not .
You do assist the storm .
Therefore thou sleep'st so sound .
I hear his trumpet .
Yet bend not all the harm upon yourself .
You swore to me when I did give it you That you would wear it till your hour of death , And that it should lie with you in your grave .

Not in this land shall he remain uncaught .
Adieu , good neighbor .

Troth , no , no more than reason .
Sir , there she stands .
Do you hear , masters ?
Peace , Smulkin .
Be brief , lest that the process of thy kindness Last longer telling than thy kindness ' date .
Alack , sir , I am sand-blind .
How canst thou cross this marriage ?
But hear thee , Gratiano .
Almost afraid to know itself .
Though he be as good a gentleman as the devil is , as Lucifer and Beelzebub himself , it is necessary , look your Grace , that he keep his vow and his oath .
Fie , fie on all tired jades , on all mad masters , and all foul ways !
Come , I will bring thee to thy bridal chamber .
Who hath relieved you ?
He that conceals him , death .
Adieu , adieu !
But your news is not true .
Skipper , stand back .
I was born to speak all mirth and no matter .
No , truly .
Time shall unfold what plighted cunning hides , Who covers faults at last with shame derides .
Are you a man ?
Oh , that I served that lady And might not be delivered to the world , Till I had made mine own occasion mellow , What my estate is .
No , my noble lord .
Nay , we will all of us be there to fetch him .
Speak .
No , 'twas the vane on the house .
For when mine hours Were nice and lucky , men did ransom lives Of me for jests ; but now I'll set my teeth And send to darkness all that stop me .
Fie !
Pray you , let Cassio be received again .
A good persuasion .
Ay , thou poor ghost , whiles memory holds a seat In this distracted globe .
Draw and come .
Thy sister's sister .
Not dead ?
I made no such report .
Come , let me wipe thy face .
The curfew bell hath rung .
What need the bridge much broader than the flood ?
They shout for joy .
Heaven preserve you !
Why , man ?
Firm and irrevocable is my doom Which I have passed upon her .
Your Majesty shall mock at me .
But , as he was ambitious , I slew him .
Let me see your eyes .
I wonder what it bodes .
So please your grace , the Prologue is addressed .
What answer , sir ?
Farewell .
How say you now ?
It stops me here , it is too much of joy .
It may be worth thy pains , for I can sing And speak to him in many sorts of music That will allow me very worth his service .
We , at the height , are ready to decline .
You see her eyes are open .
This purse of ducats I received from you , And Dromio my man did bring them me .
Most mighty duke , behold a man much wronged .
Do it , England , For like the hectic in my blood he rages , And thou must cure me .
Then you are mad indeed , if you be no better in your wits than a fool .
For this night , to bed , and dream on the event .
How came her eyes so bright ?
Let their heads be slickly combed , their blue coats brushed , and their garters of an indifferent knit .
To move is to stir , and to be valiant is to stand .
If he were dead , what would betide on me ?
In faith , my hand meant nothing to my sword .
Tis a good hand , A frank one .
I will give thee mine .
So may it be indeed .
And I do believe your Majesty takes no scorn to wear the leek upon Saint Tavy's day .
Thou flea , thou nit , thou winter cricket thou !
But where was this ?
I chose her when I could not ask my father For his advice , nor thought I had one .
We two alone will sing like birds i ' th ' cage .
Now I see , I see , In Fulvia's death how mine received shall be .
But nature should bring forth Of its own kind all foison , all abundance , To feed my innocent people .
Hum !
I know him well .
My life is run his compass .
I do serve you in this business .
Her husband , knave .
The bloody proclamation to escape , That followed me so near , O our lives ' sweetness ,
And when she speaks , is it not an alarum to love ?
One Angelo , a goldsmith .
Here comes the herald of the French , my liege .
Why call you me "love" ?
Stand from the hearse .
Faith , the priest was good enough , for all the old gentleman's saying .
The urging of that word "judgment" hath bred a kind of remorse in me .
What a sigh is there !
By this hand , they are scoundrels and substractors that say so of him .
Who's born that day When I forget to send to Antony Shall die a beggar .
Well , I'll be revenged as I may .
I long with all my heart to see the prince .
What should I say , sweet lady ?
Indeed , upon my sword , indeed .
Unto the dignity and height of fortune , The high imperial type of this earth's glory .
Stay not to answer me , but get thee gone .
And to see how he prizes the foolish woman your wife !
Nay , you must forget that .
While we reason here , A royal battle might be won and lost .
He replied , "Thou unpossessing bastard !
Alas , and woe !
Once more remove , good friends .
No , madam .
Not for the wide world .
Signor Antonio ?
How hast thou the heart , Being a divine , a ghostly confessor , A sin-absolver , and my friend professed , To mangle me with that word "banished" ?
I am weary of you .
Gentlewoman , my lady calls .
Well , heaven's above all , and there be souls must be saved , and there be souls must not be saved .
If love be blind , love can not hit the mark .
An if I be , sir , is it any offense ?
You have of late stood out against your brother , and he hath ta'en you newly into his grace , where it is impossible you should take true root but by the fair weather that you make yourself .
My master's mind .
Oh , a cherubim Thou wast that did preserve me .
He threw his eye aside , And mark what object did present itself : Under an old oak , whose boughs were mossed with age And high top bald with dry antiquity , A wretched , ragged man , o'ergrown with hair , Lay sleeping on his back .
God hold it , to your Honor's good content !
Tis exactly valued , Not petty things admitted .
Dorset is fled to Richmond .
Have patience , I beseech .
Ay , my lord .
Is the day so young ?
Well , go thy way .
Petruchio , stand by a while .
I had a pass with him , rapier , scabbard , and all , and he gives me the stuck-in with such a mortal motion , that it is inevitable .
Give me some little breath , some pause , dear lord , Before I positively speak in this .
Shall I attend your Grace ?
Let that suffice you .
We can not all be masters , nor all masters Can not be truly followed .
Long stayed he so .
She ate no meat today , nor none shall eat .
A most manly wit , Margaret , it will not hurt a woman .
Here he comes .
Oh , no , good Kate .
My leg is cut in two .
Her eyes are fierce , but thine Do comfort and not burn .
The point envenomed too ! , Then , venom , to thy work .
Do not , Phoebe .
Spend this for me .
If with myself I hold intelligence Or have acquaintance with mine own desires , If that I do not dream or be not frantic , As I do trust I am not , then , dear uncle , Never so much as in a thought unborn Did I offend your Highness .
Most kind messenger , Say to great Caesar this in deputation : I kiss his conqu'ring hand .
We'll go along together , And ere we have thy youthful wages spent , We'll light upon some settled low content .
I frown the while , and perchance wind up watch , or play with my , some rich jewel .
Madam , you must come to your uncle .
Not to his father's .
Upon the corner of the moon There hangs a vap'rous drop profound .
If thou beest not immortal , look about you .
Ay , but , lady , That policy may either last so long , Or feed upon such nice and waterish diet , Or breed itself so out of circumstances , That , I being absent and my place supplied , My general will forget my love and service .
Signior Brabantio , ho !
Let her hang me .
One word more .
O , how this mother swells up toward my heart !
That high All-seer which I dallied with Hath turned my feigned prayer on my head And given in earnest what I begged in jest .
As from a bear a man would run for life , So fly I from her that would be my wife .
And for his dreams , I wonder he's so simple To trust the mock'ry of unquiet slumbers .
I'll go alone .
Yet , in reason , no man should possess him with any appearance of fear , lest he , by showing it , should dishearten his army .
Th ' affair cries haste And speed must answer it .
I'll none now .
Why had I one ?
Who of my people hold him in delay ?
Nay , that's certain .
Hark , hark !
Give me thy hand .
I speak not like a dotard nor a fool , As under privilege of age to brag What I have done being young , or what would do Were I not old .
Is she not a modest young lady ?
Get your apparel together , good strings to your beards , new ribbons to your pumps .
Truly , young gentlemen , though there was no great matter in the ditty , yet the note was very untunable .
What would my potent master ?
He has killed me , mother .
His company must do his minions grace , Whilst I at home starve for a merry look .
Hang up thy mistress !
Ill will never said well .
Travelers ne'er did lie , Though fools at home condemn 'em .
Thou livest .
My life will be too short , And every measure fail me .
Though it be honest , it is never good To bring bad news .
I have heard him read many lectures against it , and I thank God I am not a woman , to be touched with so many giddy offenses as he hath generally taxed their whole sex withal .
Nay , I have ta'en you napping , gentle love , And have forsworn you with Hortensio .
We doubt not now But every rub is smoothed on our way .
What is the matter , masters ? , Honest Iago , that looks dead with grieving , Speak , who began this ?
Tis a shrewd doubt , though it be but a dream .
The even mead , that erst brought sweetly forth The freckled cowslip , burnet , and green clover , Wanting the scythe , withal uncorrected , rank , Conceives by idleness , and nothing teems But hateful docks , rough thistles , kecksies , burrs , Losing both beauty and utility .
Master Fer .
Decius , go tell them Caesar will not come .
Amen .
He speaks nothing but madman .
If all the wine in my bottle will recover him , I will help his ague .
Cassio !
I will be free from thee .
Yet must not we put the strong law on him .
We must starve our sight From lovers ' food till morrow deep midnight .
I have a pain upon my forehead , here .
There is the playhouse now , there must you sit , And thence to France shall we convey you safe And bring you back , charming the narrow seas To give you gentle pass ; for , if we may , We'll not offend one stomach with our play .
Well , happiness to their sheets !
An honest man he is , and hates the slime That sticks on filthy deeds .
We'll to church tomorrow .
Thou'st spoken right .
I may say "thrusting" it , For piercing steel and darts envenomed Shall be as welcome to the ears of Brutus As tidings of this sight .
Did Michael Cassio , when you wooed my lady , Know of your love ?
If the Prince be too important , tell him there is measure in everything , and so dance out the answer .
Oh , wonderful !
Thou dost not mark me .
Nay , he reserved a blanket , else we had been all shamed .
Tis dangerous when the baser nature comes Between the pass and fell incensed points Of mighty opposites .
Touching our person , seek we no revenge , But we our kingdom's safety must so tender , Whose ruin you have sought , that to her laws We do deliver you .
Stay and speak !
What is 't thou say'st ?
But tell me , is young George Stanley living ?
We will be married o ' Sunday .
How does my good Lord Hamlet ?
I said thou hadst a fine wit .
Thou hast killed my child .
His name's Cinna .
Tis clean out of the way .
Ay , and that thou and the proudest of you all shall find when he comes home .
We'll see our husbands Before they think of us .
I pray you , is my master yet returned ?
What doth she say , my lord of Buckingham ?
She was of Carthage , not of Tunis .
Well , sir , then 'twill be dry .
My liege , this was my glove ; here is the fellow of it .
Marry , sir , for this something that you gave me for nothing .
Come with a thought .
Not yet old enough for a man , nor young enough for a boy , as a squash is before 'tis a peascod , or a codling when 'tis almost an apple .
He hath done good service , lady , in these wars .
Be quiet and depart .
If she do bid me pack , I'll give her thanks , As though she bid me stay by her a week .
Nay , but swear 't .
For he loves to hear That unicorns may be betrayed with trees , And bears with glasses , elephants with holes , Lions with toils , and men with flatterers .
Sure , I think so , And therefore certainly it were not good She knew his love , lest she make sport at it .
Sit you too .
That's not an office for a friend , my lord .
Despised , distressed , hated , martyred , killed !
I'll not endure it .
An you be mine , I'll give you to my friend .
Tis strange , strange .
My father is not dead , for all your saying .
Why ?
If this were played upon a stage now , I could condemn it as an improbable fiction .
And in assemblies too .
Question : why , an hour in clamor and a quarter in rheum .
Nay , an there were two such , we should have none shortly , for one would kill the other .
How , how I pray you ?
Please you , draw near. , Louder the music there !
March gently on to meet him .
Give me that boy and I will go with thee .
Bid her come hither .
She hath prevented me .
Silenced with that , In viewing o'er the rest o ' the selfsame day , He finds thee in the stout Norweyan ranks , Nothing afeard of what thyself didst make , Strange images of death .
Were such things here as we do speak about ?
Say , have I thy consent that they shall die ?
My uncle ?
Look , look .
Thy face is mine , and thou hast slandered it .
Here's more news .
Sir , shall I to this lady ?
And what noise is this ?
I saw him put down the other day with an ordinary fool that
I'll come to him .
Then fly !
If I can cross him any way , I bless myself every way .
I have well approved it , sir .
A good note , that keeps you from the blow of the law .
No , my lord .
Why so earnestly seek you to put up that letter ?
Is your Englishman so expert in his drinking ?
Then slip I from her bum , down topples she , And "Tailor ! " cries , and falls into a cough , And then the whole quire hold their hips and laugh , And waxen in their mirth , and neeze , and swear A merrier hour was never wasted there .
Here comes Antony .
With bills on their necks : "Be it known unto all men by these presents." The eldest of the three wrestled with Charles , the duke's wrestler , which Charles in a moment threw him and broke three of his ribs , that there is little hope of life in him .
He finished indeed his mortal act That day that made my sister thirteen years .
But it is no matter .
Leave me and do the thing I bid thee do .
No , I will not .
Well , Jessica , go in .
When I come where he calls , then he is gone .
Where remains he ?
That now Sweno , the Norways ' king , craves composition .
What would my lord ?
Why , then , let them alone till they are sober .
Stanley , look to your wife .
Just as high as my heart .
I'll tell you who time ambles withal , who time trots withal , who time gallops withal , and who he stands still withal .
Tis bootless to exclaim .
Cried he ?
Are they good ?
O my son , my son !
By your patience , I may not suffer you to visit them .
And do you now strew flowers in his way That comes in triumph over Pompey's blood ?
Let him appear that's come from Antony .
So let him land , And solemnly see him set on to London .
But are they , Ariel , safe ?
Thou shalt serve me .
Oh , devil , devil !
By th ' way we met My wife , her sister , and a rabble more Of vile confederates .
Dost thou squiny at me ?
Hail , mortal .
Amen , with all my heart .
What if my house be troubled with a rat And I be pleased to give ten thousand ducats To have it baned ?
Forever and forever farewell , Cassius .
Mark Antony I served , who best was worthy Best to be served .
Are you sure That we are awake ?
Shall we not ?
But what talk I of this ?
There's one at the gate .
Yet I profess curing it by counsel .
God help the noble Claudio !
Why , Dromio ?
Caesar , I shall .
Both one and other he denies me now .
I do , truly , for thou swear'st to me thou art honest .
Your will ?
Shall we part , sweet girl ?
Upon the stroke of four .
He thinks he still is at his instrument .
I am a fool To weep at what I am glad of .
Madam , I am not well .
What grows of it , no matter .
Prescribe not us our duty .
Don Pedro is approached .
The ways are dangerous .
He was wont to call me usurer ; let him look to his bond .
In nothing am I changed But in my garments .
Me they shall feel while I am able to stand , and 'tis known I am a pretty piece of flesh .
Hugh Capet also , who usurped the crown Of Charles the duke of Lorraine , sole heir male Of the true line and stock of Charles the Great , To find his title with some shows of truth , Though in pure truth it was corrupt and naught , Conveyed himself as th ' heir to th ' Lady Lingare , Daughter to Charlemagne , who was the son To Lewis the Emperor , and Lewis the son Of Charles the Great .
My father's death , Thy life hath it dishonored .
To punish me for what you make me do Seems much unequal .
My liege , They are not yet come back .
Then say at once what is it thou requests .
God's will , I pray thee wish not one man more .
Fine apparition !
I gave him no order .
Farewell .
When I did make thee free , swor'st thou not then To do this when I bade thee ?
Good Margaret , run thee to the parlor .
And , but for ceremony , such a wretch , Winding up days with toil and nights with sleep , Had the forehand and vantage of a king .
Use your authority .
And all my armor laid into my tent ?
I'll be your purse-bearer and leave you For an hour .
This in the public eye ?
Give him this letter .
Will you go , coz ?
They thus directed , we will follow In the main battle , whose puissance on either side Shall be well winged with our chiefest horse .
In pity of the challenger's youth , I would fain dissuade him , but he will not be entreated .
Ariel , thy charge Exactly is performed .
I will send for him , and question him yourself .
What stay had we but Clarence ?
I am not for this ambling .
I will read it. , How much unlike art thou to Portia !
Now will I question Cassio of Bianca , A huswife that by selling her desires Buys herself bread and clothes .
Let us score their backs And snatch 'em up , as we take hares , behind !
Ten masts at each make not the altitude Which thou hast perpendicularly fell .
Rather a ditch in Egypt Be gentle grave unto me .
Edmund I think is gone In pity of his misery to dispatch His nighted life ; moreover to descry The strength o ' th ' enemy .
Be assured We go to use our hands and not our tongues .
What , you mean my face ?
Come , sir , you peevishly threw it to her , and her will is it should be so returned .
What , has this thing appeared again tonight ?
If but as well I other accents borrow , That can my speech diffuse , my good intent May carry through itself to that full issue For which I razed my likeness .
O sun , thy uprise shall I see no more .
And I will purge thy mortal grossness so That thou shalt like an airy spirit go. , Peaseblossom , Cobweb , Moth , and Mustardseed !
Up , my lords .
On Tuesday noon , or night , or Wednesday morn .
We will haste us .
I'll go with you .
For hear me , Hero , wooing , wedding , and repenting is as a Scotch jig , a measure , and a cinquepace .
If not , why then this parting was well made .
An you will not be answered with reason , I must die .
Then none have I offended .
Along with them They brought one Pinch , a hungry , lean-faced villain , A mere anatomy , a mountebank , A threadbare juggler , and a fortune-teller , A needy , hollow-eyed , sharp-looking wretch , A living dead man .
Oh , she doth teach the torches to burn bright !
No , not tonight .
You , Pyramus ' father. , Myself , Thisbe's father. , Snug the joiner , you , the lion's part. , And I hope here is a play fitted .
But , hold thee , take this garland on thy brow .
These wise men that give fools money get themselves a good report , after fourteen years ' purchase .
It is a paltry cap , A custard-coffin , a bauble , a silken pie .
My way is now to hie home to his house And tell his wife that , being lunatic , He rushed into my house and took perforce My ring away .
No port is free , no place That guard and most unusual vigilance Does not attend my taking .
Swum ashore , man , like a duck .
Oh , behold How pomp is followed !
Marry , now I can tell .
I have been up this hour , awake all night .
Twas the boy that stole your meat , and you'll beat the post .
To have no man come over me !
But were the day come , I should wish it dark , That I were couching with the doctor's clerk .
Away , and let me die .
O hell , what have we here ?
What think you of this fool , Malvolio ?
Away , slight man !
Do you intend to stay with me tonight ?
To who , my lord ? , Who hath the office ?
Cool it with a baboon's blood , Then the charm is firm and good .
There is no more but so .
Now I perceive they have conjoined all three To fashion this false sport , in spite of me. , Injurious Hermia !
His affections do not that way tend .
I saw Mark Antony offer him a crown ( yet 'twas not a crown neither , 'twas one of these coronets ) and , as I told you , he put it by once , but , for all that , to my thinking , he would fain have had it .
A sleeve ?
Of what nature the wrongs are thou hast done him , I know not , but thy intercepter , full of despite , bloody as the hunter , attends thee at the orchard end .
Tis he , that villain Romeo .
Talk no more .
I can not be a man with wishing , therefore I will die a woman with grieving .
They have not been commanded , mighty king .
You slave , you cur !
Not proud you have , but thankful that you have .
Then you are a better than the king .
Well roared , Lion !
Some dungeon .
My brother and thy uncle , called Antonio , I pray thee , mark me ( that a brother should Be so perfidious !
Methinks the wind hath spoke aloud at land , A fuller blast ne'er shook our battlements .
Adieu .
A worthy pioneer !
To his father , that so tenderly and entirely loves him .
Tell me in sadness , who is that you love .
Go after .
I promise you your kindred hath made my eyes water ere now .
Then I know My answer must be made .
Be quiet , people .
God keep you from them , and from such false friends .
Hear me , good madam .
I'll not have it so .
Ay , Lepidus .
Note this before my notes : There's not a note of mine that's worth the noting .
You are welcome , masters , welcome , all ! , I am glad to see thee well. , Welcome , good friends. , O old friend ?
How , in stripping it , You more invest it !
Sweet lord , if your lordship were at leisure , I should impart a thing to you from His Majesty .
When they do choose , They have the wisdom by their wit to lose .
Some of them will fall tomorrow , I hope .
Bind up my wounds !
Nay , let me alone for swearing .
The man is innocent .
Why then , let fall Your horrible pleasure .
Alas , my liege , my wife is dead tonight .
For what advancement may I hope from thee That no revenue hast but thy good spirits , To feed and clothe thee ?
Signior Montano , Your trusty and most valiant servitor , With his free duty recommends you thus , And prays you to believe him .
She is spherical , like a globe .
Do I entice you ?
Come , the recorders !
The like is on her arm .
Heaven and thy thoughts are witness that thou art .
Not here in presence .
It hath made me mad .
My excellent good friends !
There is too great testimony in your complexion that it was a passion of earnest .
Being holiday , the beggar's shop is shut .
Why , this is a more exquisite song than the other .
The life" ?
The ox hath therefore stretched his yoke in vain , The ploughman lost his sweat , and the green corn Hath rotted ere his youth attained a beard .
Read it .
Some o' their plants are ill-rooted already .
A good wench , give it me .
What's done is done .
And thought they Margaret was Hero ?
Now let thy friendly hand Put strength enough to 't .
Yes , one , and in this manner .
Take that of me , my friend , who have the power To seal th ' accuser's lips .
Tis certain so , the Prince woos for himself .
Do you triumph ?
Show his eyes and grieve his heart .
My lord , from head to foot .
Brutus , a word with you .
I pray you , husband , be not so disquiet .
I pray thee , moralize them .
Glance at my credit with Hippolyta , Didst thou not lead him through the glimmering night From Perigouna , whom he ravished ?
But seven years since , in Syracusa , boy , Thou know'st we parted .
I was the other day talking on the sea-bank with certain Venetians , and thither comes the bauble and , by this hand , she falls me thus about my neck , Crying "O dear Cassio ! " as it were .
Trinculo , keep a good tongue in your head .
Ay , so please your Majesty .
Thou hast seen a farmer's dog bark at a beggar ?
That is the chain , sir , which you had of me .
If you can , your reason ?
The air breathes upon us here most sweetly .
I'll wait upon your Lordship .
Now follow , if thou darest , to try whose right , Of thine or mine , is most in Helena .
And your experience makes you sad .
What , I , my lord ?
Is Caesar yet gone to the Capitol ?
Farewell .
She shall , Lucentio .
Come , no matter vor your foins .
We'll burn the house of Brutus .
That will I make before I let thee go .
Where runn'st thou so fast ?
Now I arise .
A very gentle beast , of a good conscience .
And I as I love Hastings with my heart .
Ay , a tailor , sir .
Young gentleman , your spirits are too bold for your years .
Lysander , whereto tends all this ?
Will you grant with me That Ferdinand is drowned ?
Whereon I do beseech thee , grant me this , To leave me but a little to myself .
He shall do this , or else I do recant The pardon that I late pronounced here .
But I had rather fast from all four days Than drink so much in one .
He sends to know if your pleasure hold to play with Laertes , or that you will take longer time .
Where be these knaves ?
Hear me with patience .
Yet 'tis the plague to great ones , Prerogatived are they less than the base .
And his unbookish jealousy must construe Poor Cassio's smiles , gestures , and light behavior Quite in the wrong. , How do you now , lieutenant ?
The triplex , sir , is a good tripping measure , or the bells of Saint Bennet , sir , may put you in mind , one , two , three .
If he please To give me conquered Egypt for my son , He gives me so much of mine own as I Will kneel to him with thanks .
I'll do my best To woo your lady , Whoe'er I woo , myself would be his wife .
You sent me for a rope's end as soon .
Ay me , detested !
A friend .
I will be strange , stout , in yellow stockings , and cross-gartered , even with the swiftness of putting on .
Besides , he brings his destiny with him .
Sad , lady !
This is the excellent foppery of the world that when we are sick in fortune , often the surfeit of our own behavior , we make guilty of our disasters the sun , the moon , and the stars , as if we were villains by necessity , fools by heavenly compulsion , knaves , thieves , and treachers by spherical predominance , drunkards , liars , and adulterers by an enforced obedience of planetary influence , and all that we are evil in by a divine thrusting-on .
Let not the royal bed of Denmark be A couch for luxury and damned incest .
For Pyramus therein doth kill himself .
It is so .
It will be short .
All thy other titles thou hast given away that thou wast born with .
Our wars are done , the Turks are drowned .
Hark you , sir .
But did you think the Prince would have served you thus ?
Not in my house , Lucentio , for you know Pitchers have ears , and I have many servants .
Death , that hath sucked the honey of thy breath , Hath had no power yet upon thy beauty .
Well , do your discretion .
What , are the brothers parted ?
Come away , servant , come .
This fellow is wise enough to play the fool , And to do that well craves a kind of wit .
Ay .
Thou naughty knave , what trade ?
I might call him A thing divine , for nothing natural I ever saw so noble .
But we both obey And here give up ourselves , in the full bent , To lay our service freely at your feet To be commanded .
Fool , of thyself speak well .
Pray God , sir , your wife send you not a worse .
What , all my pretty chickens and their dam At one fell swoop ?
Prithee , go in thyself .
Who comes here ?
I will die bravely , like a smug bridegroom .
It is no hidden virtue in him .
Why , that he did , I know not what he did .
Believe me , I had rather have lost my purse Full of crusadoes .
I do but beg a little changeling boy , To be my henchman .
Give me your hand .
Call , good Mercutio .
Why , what else ?
His Honor and myself are at the one , And at the other is my good friend Catesby , Where nothing can proceed that toucheth us Whereof I shall not have intelligence .
The servants of the Duke and my lieutenant ?
I take it your own business calls on you And you embrace th ' occasion to depart .
Friendship is constant in all other things Save in the office and affairs of love .
There , my lord .
The man that once did sell the lion's skin While the beast lived was killed with hunting him .
Thou 'dst never fear the net nor lime , The pitfall nor the gin .
What's he that speaks for Edmund , Earl of Gloucester ?
Where will the old duke live ?
We came hither to fight with you .
He hath honored me of late , and I have bought Golden opinions from all sorts of people , Which would be worn now in their newest gloss , Not cast aside so soon .
I partly know the man .
Come , shall we hear this music ?
That young swain that you saw here but erewhile , That little cares for buying anything .
Hurt him in eleven places .
Come , we'll have him in a dark room and bound .
The clock struck nine when I did send the Nurse .
Saw who ?
Lay hand on heart , advise .
Oh , but she'll keep her word .
Who chooseth me shall have as much as he deserves" !
My dismal scene I needs must act alone .
And their tongues rot That speak against us !
Tis now near night .
What it is , my Caius , I shall unfold to thee as we are going To whom it must be done .
Go , get thee gone , I say .
No .
God be wi ' you , sir .
Infirmity , that decays the wise , doth ever make the better fool .
Make forth .
You need not fear , lady , the having any of these lords .
How much unlike art thou Mark Antony !
I deny it not .
Who ?
Faith , he tonight hath boarded a land carrack .
It must be Nay , but hear you , Goodman Delver , Give me leave .
Farewell , great chief .
I shall miss thee , But yet thou shalt have freedom. , So , so , so. , To the king's ship , invisible as thou art .
Young boys and girls Are level now with men .
Nay , but Beatrice , Sweet Hero , she is wronged , she is slandered , she is undone .
And I , my royal sovereign .
But what of Cicero ?
strange that sheeps ' guts should hale souls out of men's bodies ?
Do you consent we shall acquaint him with it , As needful in our loves , fitting our duty ?
Oh , treason of the blood !
Marry , th ' athversary was have possession of the pridge , but he is enforced to retire , and the duke of Exeter is master of the pridge .
I do beseech your Grace pardon me , Who , earnest in the service of my God , Deferred the visitation of my friends .
What is it she does now ?
When he returns from hunting , I will not speak with him .
Your worship's friend and Launcelot , sir .
I hope she will be brief .
For what good turn ?
The fellow has good judgment .
Let's withdraw , my lord .
Fetch me the handkerchief , my mind misgives .
Good Hermia , do not be so bitter with me .
To these injunctions every one doth swear That comes to hazard for my worthless self .
But you'll be secret ?
The time to come .
Where is my lady ?
Let us hear what Antony can say .
Welcome , destruction , blood , and massacre .
I grant you , friends , if you should fright the ladies out of their wits , they would have no more discretion but to hang us .
Come , sir , I will not let you go .
Therefore I say with noble Buckingham That it is meet so few should fetch the prince .
You see an ass head of your own , do you ?
Yet touch this sparingly , as 'twere far off , Because , my lord , you know my mother lives .
There is no fear in him .
I am maimed for ever .
Fouler than heart can think thee , thou canst make No excuse current but to hang thyself .
I will tell you .
Good gentlemen , look fresh and merrily .
Here comes newer comfort .
Then stand with us .
He would make but a sport of it and torment the poor lady worse .
No , but she let it drop by negligence And , to th ' advantage , I being here , took 't up .
Let us rather Hold fast the mortal sword and , like good men , Bestride our downfall'n birthdom .
Scurvy knave !
But say , I prithee , is he coming home ?
You shall be soon dispatched with fair conditions .
Where's Monsieur Mustardseed ?
I pray you , hear her speak .
News , my good lord , from Rome .
Good sir , be patient .
What's he ?
From Silvius , sir .
Your It is not a fashion for the maids in France to kiss before they are married , would she say ?
mutinies , in countries discord , in palaces treason , and the bond cracked 'twixt son and father .
Hark , hark !
Remember First to possess his books , for without them He's but a sot , as I am , nor hath not One spirit to command .
Away !
Would that alone o ' love he would detain , So he would keep fair quarter with his bed .
Why , this is not Lear .
Let her have your voice .
No words can that woe sound .
Taste your legs , sir .
I will not say so , for fear I should be faced out of my way .
He lives that loves thee better than he could .
But , sir , such wanton , wild , and usual slips
And so I am , I am .
Now to you .
Be warned by me , then : they that ride so , and ride not warily , fall into foul bogs .
Let every man be master of his time Till seven at night .
Thy grace shall have it .
But shall we wear these glories for a day , Or shall they last and we rejoice in them ?
Wilt thou provoke me ?
You will never run mad , niece .
Command him away .
My lord , I claim the gift , my due by promise , For which your honor and your faith is pawned , Th ' earldom of Hereford and the movables Which you promised I shall possess .
There is some strange misprision in the princes .
I am a soldier , I , Older in practice , abler than yourself To make conditions .
What , mistress !
Thy Fates open their hands .
I would I had thy inches .
Therefore , O Antony , stay not by his side .
Tell me , thou villain-slave , where are my children ?
On Fortune's cap we are not the very button .

I , madam ?
Thou wouldst make a good fool .
Not possible .
One .
To Brutus ' , to Cassius ' , burn all .
Barren my wit ?
In what chapter of his bosom ?
Cast thy humble slough , " says she .
That , sir , which I will not report after her .
None in the world , nor do I know the man .
Go seek the traitor Gloucester .
I hate the Moor , And it is thought abroad that 'twixt my sheets He's done my office .
I am glad thou canst speak no better English , for if thou couldst , thou wouldst find me such a plain king that thou wouldst think I had sold my farm to buy my crown .
Do you like this haste ?
Their hands and faces were all badged with blood .
An I were so apt to quarrel as thou art , any man should buy the fee simple of my life for an hour and a quarter .
By heaven , you do me wrong !
Unbutton here .
An if they live , I hope I need not fear .
I stumbled when I saw .
If I gave them all my living , I'd keep my coxcombs myself .
I would I were as sure of a good dinner .
Slanders , sir .
Hath he asked for me ?
I hear him mock The luck of Caesar , which the gods give men To excuse their after wrath. , Husband , I come !
What , shall we toward the Tower ?
The fault , dear Brutus , is not in our stars But in ourselves , that we are underlings .
Now the witch take me if I meant it thus !
Take it and do 't , and leave me for this time .
I will be hanged , if some eternal villain , Some busy and insinuating rogue , Some cogging , cozening slave , to get some office , Have not devised this slander .
Prates too. , What say you , James Soundpost ?
Confirmed , confirmed !
So out went the candle and we were left darkling .
Is not marriage honorable in a beggar ?
But I am sent to find those persons whose names are here writ , and can never find what names the writing person hath here writ .
Why , so didst thou .
Ah , poor heart , he is so shaked of a burning quotidian tertian that it is most lamentable to behold .
You are a royal one , and we obey you .
Not I , believe me .
He hath the falling sickness .
Hold , for your lives !
How shall we try it ?
No evil lost is wailed when it is gone .
If then that friend demand why Brutus rose against Caesar , this is my answer : not that I loved Caesar less , but that I loved Rome more .
Tis true indeed , so your daughter says .
They bleed on both sides. , How is it , my lord ?
An abominable monster !
Why , then , 'tis none to you , for there is nothing either good or bad , but thinking makes it so .
If I last in this service , you must case me in leather .
And ever will , though he do shake me off To beggarly divorcement , love him dearly , Comfort forswear me !
Sit down and rest .
Now , my Lord Constable ?
I am glad to see your highness .
Why , thou hast put him in such a dream that when the image of it leaves him he must run mad .
Well , do it , and be brief .
I would thou couldst .
I say she never did invent this letter .
Hie you , Messala , And I will seek for Pindarus the while .
Mine nightingale , We have beat them to their beds .
Some to Decius ' house and some to Casca's .
Hear you , my lords , We have some haste , Leonato .
Brother , ho !
He waxes desperate with imagination .
Tis a pageant , To keep us in false gaze .
Enobarbus , Antony Hath after thee sent all thy treasure , with His bounty overplus .
Have I not heard the sea , puffed up with winds , Rage like an angry boar chafed with sweat ?
Peace , peace !
Who's there ?
Lives he , good uncle ?
I have almost slipped the hour .
Fret till your proud heart break .
God bless me from a challenge !
Tie up my love's tongue .
Who keeps her company ?
Will he tell us what this show meant ?
Ha !
He'll say 'twas done cowardly , when he wakes .
What wilt thou do ?
Tell me , Othello .
There's no doubt his majesty Will soon recover his accustomed health .
Tomorrow is the day .
If they have done this deed , my noble lord , If ?
Ay , master .
List a word .
Nay , heaven doth know .
The clock hath stricken three .
Who's there ?
Here comes Thisbe .
There , my blessing with thee .
Of my kind uncle , that I know will give , And being but a toy , which is no grief to give .
You shall have anything .
Who chooseth me must give and hazard all he hath." Must give , for what ?
Beshrew him for 't !
In the meantime I will draw a bill of properties such as our play wants .
Why comest thou ?
Her head's declined , and death will seize her but Your comfort makes the rescue .
Swell , bosom , with thy fraught , For 'tis of aspics ' tongues !
Have I the aspic in my lips ?
Did I not , fellow ?
And when your honors mean to solemnize The bargain of your faith , I do beseech you Even at that time I may be married too .
Signor Bassanio , hear me .
Therefore thy earliness doth me assure Thou art uproused by some distemperature .
I will preach to thee .
Bad news , my lord .
If not , to say to thee that I shall die is true , but for thy love , by the Lord , no .
Oh , these men , these men !
I'll tell thee , Charles : it is the stubbornest young fellow of France , full of ambition , an envious emulator of every man's good parts , a secret and villainous contriver against me his natural brother .
Uncle !
These tidings will well comfort Cassius .
Fair lady , do you think you have fools in hand ?
Here will we sit and let the sounds of music Creep in our ears .
She speaks , yet she says nothing .
Sweet Portia , If you did know to whom I gave the ring , If you did know for whom I gave the ring , And would conceive for what I gave the ring , And how unwillingly I left the ring When naught would be accepted but the ring , You would abate the strength of your displeasure .
I grant indeed it hath not appeared , and your suspicion is not without wit and judgment .
I will o'erlook thy paper .
Our knocking has awaked him .
Instance , briefly .
When saw you my father last ?
I would the lightning had Burnt up those logs that you are enjoined to pile !
Tis a world to see , How tame , when men and women are alone , A meacock wretch can make the curstest shrew. , Give me thy hand , Kate .
Before God , and in my mind , very wise .
You men of Cyprus , let her have your knees .
I say it is the moon .
Merciful powers , Restrain in me the cursed thoughts that nature Gives way to in repose .
Well , that is the dowry of his wife ; 'tis none of his own getting .
Why , right , you are in the right .
There's rosemary , that's for remembrance .
Yet that is but a crushed necessity , Since we have locks to safeguard necessaries And pretty traps to catch the petty thieves .
The glowworm shows the matin to be near , And 'gins to pale his uneffectual fire .
Saw you anything ?
What stay had I but Edward ?
I dreamt tonight that I did feast with Caesar , And things unlucky charge my fantasy .
Would she were hearsed at my foot and the ducats in her coffin !
Oh , thou art wise !
I doubt not but his friends will turn to us .
We'll leave you , Brutus .
Unhappy fortune !
I have heard of some kind of men that put quarrels purposely on others , to taste their valor .
O perjured woman , thou dost stone my heart , And mak'st me call what I intend to do A murder , which I thought a sacrifice !
Monday , my lord .
Good morrow to thee .
Nay , their endeavor keeps in the wonted pace .
For I am sure , Though you can guess what temperance should be , You know not what it is .
I do assure you , 'tis against my will .
I dreamt a dream tonight .
You speak not as you think .
Or if thou hast not broke from company Abruptly , as my passion now makes me , Thou hast not loved .
Sure , it was the roar Of a whole herd of lions .
The Count Claudio shall marry the daughter of Leonato .
Meantime forbear , And let mischance be slave to patience. , Bring forth the parties of suspicion .
The gods do this in shame of cowardice .
Hie to high fortune !
Faith , he is posted hence on serious matter .
Then heaven Have mercy on me !
Tis her command .
Of this my letters Before did satisfy you .
O , rejoice Beyond a common joy , and set it down With gold on lasting pillars .
My lord , I did , But answer made it none .
Tis well you offer it behind her back .
I never did her any , to my knowledge .
Am I a coward ?
Take each man's censure but reserve thy judgment .
I have slept , my lord , already .
Thou art too wild , too rude and bold of voice , Parts that become thee happily enough And in such eyes as ours appear not faults .
I'll tell thee , friend , I am almost mad myself .
O happy horse , to bear the weight of Antony !
Hold , my hand .
You can not feed capons so .
It is not possible .
Everything is well .
What is that noise ?
No , I warrant you .
Sir , my liege , Do not infest your mind with beating on The strangeness of this business .
I'll see thee hanged on Sunday first .
If you outstay the time , upon mine honor And in the greatness of my word , you die .
Ere he do leave this grove , Thou shalt fly him and he shall seek thy love .
Oh , that we then could come by Caesar's spirit And not dismember Caesar !
I'll stay a month longer .
Ay , Desdemona .
And so did I .
And , as you said ( and wisely was it said ) 'T is meet that some more audience than a mother , Since nature makes them partial , should o'erhear The speech , of vantage .
Let me see .
Our course will seem too bloody , Caius Cassius , To cut the head off and then hack the limbs , Like wrath in death and envy afterwards , For Antony is but a limb of Caesar .
I know him ; he wears a lock .
Heaven rest them now .
Hast thou not a word of joy ?
No , I'll not weep .
Ay , sir .
Here is my bed .
Well , as time shall try .
How many goodly creatures are there here !
For this slave , If there be any cunning cruelty That can torment him much and hold him long , It shall be his .
Where is this rash and most unfortunate man ?
Not I , I must be found .
Give me thy hand , And let me see thee in thy woman's weeds .
We can not be here and there too .
At my lodging .
All but mariners Plunged in the foaming brine and quit the vessel , Then all afire with me .
Thou art like one of those fellows that , when he enters the confines of a tavern , claps me his sword upon the table and says "God send me no need of thee ! " and , by the operation of the second cup , draws it on the drawer when indeed there is no need .
You were the word of war .
That's the end .
Tomorrow shall you bear our full intent Back to our brother England .
Come , some music !
Under love's heavy burden do I sink .
Take it in what sense thou wilt .
Do you hear aught , sir , of a battle toward ?
Say I , her sovereign , am her subject low .
Wherefore ?
And smelt so ?
He speaks not true .
Pray , then , foresee me one .
Nothing but songs of death .
What , worse and worse ? , With leave , Bassanio , I am half yourself , And I must freely have the half of anything That this same paper brings you .
I know a lady in Venice would have walked barefoot to Palestine for a touch of his nether lip .
Hence will I to my ghostly friar's close cell , His help to crave and my dear hap to tell .
Com'st thou again for ransom ?
I am not in a sportive humor now .
Roderigo killed ?
Dispatch us with all speed , lest that our king Come here himself to question our delay , For he is footed in this land already .
Doth not Brutus bootless kneel ?
Heigh-ho .
Nothing that can be can come between me and the full prospect of my hopes .
Well run , Thisbe !
In what , my dear lord ?
And then give them great meals of beef and iron and steel , they will eat like wolves and fight like devils .
I have a soul of lead So stakes me to the ground I can not move .
All with me's meet that I can fashion fit .
They have made worms ' meat of me .
Time travels in diverse paces with diverse persons .
Why , I can buy me twenty at any market .
Here's our chief guest .
For my dinner .
I speak but as I find .
Who knows not that ?
Yes , in truth it is , sir .
What hast thou found ?
Write to me very shortly , And you shall understand from me her mind .
There will we dine .
O Cassio , Cassio , Cassio !
The sooner , sweet , for you .
But he , poor man , by your first order died , And that a winged Mercury did bear .
Then put up your pipes in your bag , for I'll away .
Mine honor was not yielded , But conquered merely .
What if a man bring him a hundred pound or two to make merry withal ?
Wrinkles forbid !
If there be any impediment , I pray you discover it .
What men have you lost , Fluellen ?
I marry her !
They have their exits and their entrances , And one man in his time plays many parts , His acts being seven ages .
But yet do I believe The origin and commencement of his grief Sprung from neglected love. , How now , Ophelia ?
Do you see , gentlemen ?
The meat was well , if you were so contented .
Ay , but not frighted me .
Let him not leave out The color of her hair .
Come now , your promise .
Thy Brutus bid me give it thee , and I Will do his bidding .
Both he loves .
Here he is , here he is .
Awake , awake !
Bear hence this body and attend our will .
I see the business .
Sir , the Queen .
But what's the matter , Clarence ?
Would I were in an alehouse in London !
Not life , but love in death .
The less they deserve , the more merit is in your bounty .
But I pray you , who is his companion ?
I pray you , let it stand .
Saw'st thou him enter at the abbey here ?
You see me here , you gods , a poor old man , As full of grief as age , wretched in both .
Is it possible ?
I am not treacherous .
I am the king himself .
Romeo can , Though heaven can not .
Oh , think'st thou we shall ever meet again ?
And may , through all the world !
Your son and daughter found this trespass worth The shame which here it suffers .
There , take it ; and much thanks for my good cheer .
Let it alone .
I would I were invisible , to catch the strong fellow by the leg .
I am sorry for thee , friend .
Oh , me , lieutenant !
At your kind'st leisure .
O perjured woman !
As he was valiant , I honor him .
Why then , lead on .
I know you are no truant .
Let him come when he will , I will deny thee nothing .
Bid Gloucester think of this , and he will weep .
And your reports have set the murder on .
Round , even to faultiness .
By my knavery ( if I had it ) , then I were .
Am I in earth , in heaven , or in hell ?
Well , I know not What counts harsh Fortune casts upon my face , But in my bosom shall she never come To make my heart her vassal .
I am a gentleman .
Alas , he is betrayed and I undone .
Know , my long lord , The marquess Dorset , as I hear , is fled To Richmond , in the parts where he abides .
Fear not , Cesario .
I dreamt last night of the three weird sisters : To you they have showed some truth .
If she will stir hither , I shall seem to notify unto her .
I would give all my fame for a pot of ale , and safety .
She's cold .
Will you , I pray , demand that demi-devil Why he hath thus ensnared my soul and body ?
Now heaven walks on earth .
Give me my sword .
Go , get thee to thy love , as was decreed .
It doth not fit me .
Here comes Oberon .
But his flawed heart , Alack , too weak the conflict to support , 'Twixt two extremes of passion , joy and grief , Burst smilingly .
Alas , alas !
Master young gentleman , I pray you , which is the way to Master Jew's ?
Trebonius knows his time .
How wilt thou do for a father ?
Give me now leave to leave thee .
Poor Turlygod ! " "Poor Tom ! " , That's something yet .
My Lord High Constable , the English lie within fifteen hundred paces of your tents .
Tomorrow , Caesar , I shall be furnished to inform you rightly Both what by sea and land I can be able To front this present time .
I know by that same eye there's some good news .
Nor hath Love's mind of any judgment taste , Wings and no eyes figure unheedy haste .
Perform 't , or else we damn thee." How , my love ?
Ne'er may I look on day , nor sleep on night But she tells to your Highness simple truth .
Tell me that .
Oh , yes , I heard them all , and more too , for some of them had in them more feet than the verses would bear .
Ay , you did wish that I would make her turn .
Why should Titania cross her Oberon ?
Now , if thou wert a poet , I might have some hope thou didst feign .
We all stand up against the spirit of Caesar , And in the spirit of men there is no blood .
Nurse , will you go with me into my closet To help me sort such needful ornaments As you think fit to furnish me tomorrow ?
Why , wherefore ask you this ?
Truly , sir , the better for my foes and the worse for my friends .
Come , is the bride ready to go to church ?
Gentle cousin , Let us go thank him and encourage him .
Then pleaded I for you .
Wash your hands .
I am sure he is in the fleet .
Ay , sir ; there are a crew of wretched souls That stay his cure .
No , by my life and soul !
What is thy name , young man ?
Go , make money .
He hath fought today As if a god , in hate of mankind , had Destroyed in such a shape .
What , art thou come ? , On , gentlemen , away !
At first the infant , Mewling and puking in the nurse's arms .
Thou didst prevent me .
Tis noble spoken .
But adieu .
Ay , with a twink .
But let us rear The higher our opinion , that our stirring Can from the lap of Egypt's widow pluck The ne'er lust-wearied Antony .
He was not sad , for he would shine on those That make their looks by his .
What though I be not so in grace as you , So hung upon with love , so fortunate , But miserable most , to love unloved ?
By heaven , it is the same I gave the doctor !
The business of this man looks out of him .
Alive in triumph , and Mercutio slain !
Still live they , and forever let them last .
Think on thy sins .
Rome , thou hast lost the breed of noble bloods !
D'elbow." "D'elbow , " "De nick , " "De nick." "De chin." "De sin."
Then let thy love be younger than thyself , Or thy affection can not hold the bent .
Hold , sir , for God's sake !
Come , come , dispatch .
Thou dost , and think'st it much to tread the ooze Of the salt deep , To run upon the sharp wind of the north , To do me business in the veins o ' th ' earth When it is baked with frost .
Perhaps I will return immediately .
Poor man !
Ay , sir , for three months .
Then take him up and manage well the jest .
I will follow .
No , no , the bell .
Well , go to , I will .
An Englishman ?
What's your will ?
He's friends with Caesar , In state of health , thou say'st , and , thou say'st , free .
What dost thou say ?
Sir , she is mortal .
Let us go .
The little dogs and all , Tray , Blanch , and Sweetheart , see , they bark at me .
I forgive you the praise .
God and the rope-maker bear me witness That I was sent for nothing but a rope .
No , truly .
He says he'll come .
By the hour of nine .
Now , if these men have defeated the law and outrun native punishment , though they can outstrip men , they have no wings to fly from God .
Answer every man directly .
If thou didst ever hold me in thy heart Absent thee from felicity a while , And in this harsh world draw thy breath in pain To tell my story .
As if that name , Shot from the deadly level of a gun , Did murder her , as that name's cursed hand Murdered her kinsman .
But it would warm his spirits To hear from me you had left Antony And put yourself under his shroud , The universal landlord .
Who calls so loud ?
Your wife Octavia , with her modest eyes And still conclusion , shall acquire no honor Demuring upon me .
Come , wherefore should you be so pashful ?
My mistress with a monster is in love .
I arrest thee of high treason , by the name of Thomas Grey , knight , of Northumberland .
I'll not meddle with it .
You know I gave it you half an hour since .
Transform me , then , and to your power I'll yield .
Is she shrill-tongued or low ?
You have said now .
Where ?
We'll hear a play tomorrow .
Let them come before Master Constable .
There are some shrewd contents in yond same paper That steals the color from Bassanio's cheek .
Nay , the dust Should have ascended to the roof of heaven , Raised by your populous troops .
Then , window , let day in and let life out .
If thou more murmur'st , I will rend an oak And peg thee in his knotty entrails till Thou hast howled away twelve winters .
But have I not cause to weep ?
I go ; and towards three or four o'clock Look for the news that the Guildhall affords .
Sure , these are but imaginary wiles , And lapland sorcerers inhabit here .
I did very well note him .
O Charmian , I will never go from hence .
Madam , you have done me wrong , Notorious wrong .
Dost thou think so , spirit ?
An please your Majesty , let his neck answer for it , if there is any martial law in the world .
Oh , where is Romeo ?
I had rather be a dog and bay the moon Than such a Roman .
He hath been most notoriously abused .
I will do everything that thou wilt have me .
Now , music , sound , and sing your solemn hymn .
O nature , what hadst thou to do in hell When thou didst bower the spirit of a fiend In moral paradise of such sweet flesh ?
I will do 't .
Now , as you are a Roman , tell me true .
Or shall I say her uncle ?
Nothing will come of nothing .
My soul is heavy , and I fain would sleep .
Doth my simple feature content you ?
Five shillings to one on 't , with any man that knows the statutes , he may stay him , marry , not without the Prince be willing , for indeed the watch ought to offend no man , and it is an offense to stay a man against his will .
Who serv'st thou under ?
I am now from home , and out of that provision Which shall be needful for your entertainment .
Therefore heaven nature charged That one body should be filled With all graces wide-enlarged .
Music , moody food Of us that trade in love .
Yea , Richard , when I know , for I protest As yet I do not .
Against my will I am sent to bid you come in to dinner." There's a double meaning in that .
This is thy office .
All's one .
A coward , a most devout coward , religious in it .
Is all our company here ?
Good morrow to this fair assembly .
Yond island carrions , desperate of their bones , Ill-favoredly become the morning field .
Is not this buckled well ?
What , did Caesar swoon ?
Then tell me , if I get your daughter's love , What dowry shall I have with her to wife ?
A thousand thousand !
Do as I bid you .
Yes , sir .
Peace !
Look to her , Moor , if thou hast eyes to see .
Hark , Tranio !
Courage .
Stand !
Where's Dolabella , To second Proculeius ?
Nay , I beseech you , sir , be not out with me .
To answer that , I should confess to you .
I can not find it .
An if he hear thee , thou wilt anger him .
But when shall we set the savage bull's horns on the sensible Benedick's head ?
Let's do so .
His answer was , the people were not used To be spoke to but by the recorder .
Come , down into the boat .
So the gods preserve thee !
O plague right well prevented !
What was your dream , my lord ?
Hold then my sword and turn away thy face While I do run upon it .
He is as horribly conceited of him , and pants and looks pale , as if a bear were at his heels .
She was a vixen when she went to school .
Come , brands , ho , firebrands .
Come not in here , nuncle .
Let me be your servant .
Here , stand behind this bulk , straight will he come .
No , sir .
If the enemy is an ass and a fool and a prating coxcomb , is it meet , think you , that we should also , look you , be an ass and a fool and a prating coxcomb , in your own conscience , now ?
I can see yet without spectacles , and I see no such matter .
This , Casca .
You do extend These thoughts of horror further than you shall Find cause in Caesar .
The duke is humorous .
Speak not of Helena .
Here is my journey's end , here is my butt , And very sea-mark of my utmost sail .
What does the tyrant ?
Taurus !
I will be faithful .
What , art thou drawn among these heartless hinds ?
Buy food , and get thyself in flesh. , Come , cordial and not poison , go with me To Juliet's grave , for there must I use thee .
I fly , Biondello .
Come , you and I will thither presently .
Is not tomorrow , boy , the ides of March ?
He were an excellent man that were made just in the midway between him and Benedick .
Oh , she is Ten times more gentle than her father's crabbed , And he's composed of harshness .
Courteous lord , one word .
You shall see anon how the murderer gets the love of Gonzago's wife .
Therefore no marvel though Demetrius Do , as a monster , fly my presence thus .
I pray thee , tell me then that he is well .
A king , a king !
Here do I choose , and thrive I as I may !
By the mess , ere theise eyes of mine take themselves to slomber , ay'll de gud service , or I'll lig i ' th ' grund for it , ay , or go to death .
Come down , behold no more .
You shall try but one fall .
Rumble thy bellyful !
My curses on her !
And since the quarrel Will bear no color for the thing he is , Fashion it thus : that what he is , augmented , Would run to these and these extremities .
What should I do ?
The gentleman that danced with her told her she is much wronged by you .
Give to a gracious message An host of tongues , but let ill tidings tell Themselves when they be felt .
Fire !
And stay , good Nurse .
This , Cinna .
Without , my lord ; guarded , to know your pleasure .
I pray you , what thinks he of our estate ?
Away , away , be gone .
Even she : Leonato's Hero , your Hero , every man's Hero .
Knock , I say .
Then let your will attend on their accords .
What of that ?
Never trust me , then .
Thus with a kiss I die .
Nay , I know not .
Why look you strange on me ?
Go , sirrah , take them to the buttery And give them friendly welcome every one .
And I beseech you come again tomorrow .
Our solemn hymns to sullen dirges change , Our bridal flowers serve for a buried corse , And all things change them to the contrary .
Tis not in the bond .
Come , you look paler and paler .
Front to front Bring thou this fiend of Scotland and myself .
My charity is outrage , life my shame , And in that shame still live my sorrows ' rage .
He is then a giant to an ape ; but then is an ape a doctor to such a man .
Art thou contented , Jew ?
But what will you be called ?
Oh , beware , my lord , of jealousy !
Let the garden door be shut , and leave me to my hearing .
Do not torment me , prithee .
Fool !
And while thou liv'st , dear Kate , take a fellow of plain and uncoined constancy , for he perforce must do thee right because he hath not the gift to woo in other places .
Trinculo , run into no further danger .
I see you all are bent To set against me for your merriment .
But I am shepherd to another man And do not shear the fleeces that I graze .
Lo , here I lie , Never to rise again .
They shouted thrice .
This business is well ended .
Were he not warmed with ale , This were a bed but cold to sleep so soundly .
Tell me but this , Have you not sometimes seen a handkerchief Spotted with strawberries in your wife's hand ?
Under what title shall I woo for thee , That God , the law , my honor and her love Can make seem pleasing to her tender years ?
No .
Believe me , I can not .
Madam , how like you this play ?
If thus thou vanishest , thou tell'st the world It is not worth leave-taking .
Thou dost talk nothing to me .
Look , my lord , it comes !
How now , what news ?
I'll have her , but I will not keep her long .
I will construe to them whence you come .
But if thou diest before I come , thou art a mocker of my labor .
Nay , rather persuade him to hold his hands .
Moon and stars !
Even he that makes her queen .
Therefore tremble and depart .
His breeding , sir , hath been at my charge .
I shall obey you in all fair commands .
Well , time is the old justice that examines all such offenders , and let time try .
My good lords both , with all the heed I can .
Good morrow , Brutus .
You may do your will , But he's a tried and valiant soldier .
Was he not born of woman ?
I know his soul is in heaven , fool .
Where should Othello go ? , Now , how dost thou look now ?
I do not like the office .
Content .
Fly And make your peace with Caesar .
And she's obedient , as you say , obedient , Very obedient. , Proceed you in your tears. , Concerning this , sir , Oh , well-painted passion ! , I am commanded home. , Get you away , I'll send for you anon. , Sir , I obey the mandate And will return to Venice. , Hence , avaunt !
Your Highness told me I should post before .
What hour now ?
You shall know more hereafter .
Nay , then , thou mock'st me .
What canst thou swear by now ?
Ride you this afternoon ?
What says your Highness to my just request ?
Why doth the Jew pause ?
They are weary ?
I'll sell all my land .
What , ho !
I am not Barbason ; you can not conjure me .
They all do hate him As rootedly as I .
Where it seems best unto your royal self .
I'll put a girdle round about the Earth In forty minutes .
And how besides thyself ?
But , like the owner of a foul disease , To keep it from divulging , let it feed Even on the pith of life .
If my heart's dear love , Well , do not swear .
We'll hear it , Antony .
Will you go ?
