Now , by my troth , if I had been remembered , I could have given my uncle's grace a flout To touch his growth nearer than he touched mine .
Bring it hither to me in the orchard .
Will you stay awhile ?
Well , I will thither .
Who would not have his wife so ?
Back , slave , or I will break thy pate across .
Here's that shall drive some of them to a noncome .
O Romeo , Romeo , brave Mercutio is dead !
Gone she is .
I will deal in poison with thee , or in bastinado , or in steel .
Oh , that woman that can not make her fault her husband's occasion , let her never nurse her child herself , for she will breed it like a fool .
O , remember , God , To hear her prayer for them , as now for us !
Portia is dead .
How now , my lord ?
Let's briefly put on manly readiness , And meet i ' th ' hall together .
Who offered him the crown ?
Stanley , he is your wife's son .
Thou say'st the king grows mad .
Moved , " in good time .
Pluck them asunder .
Thyself shalt see the act .

Boundless intemperance In nature is a tyranny .
They are so still , Or thou , the greatest soldier of the world , Art turned the greatest liar .
I crave the law , The penalty , and forfeit of my bond .
I follow him to serve my turn upon him .
By providence divine .
Farewell , good Salisbury , and good luck go with thee .
Heavens thank you for 't !
Didst hear her speak ?
Say again , where didst thou leave these varlets ?
A mighty strength they carry .
Now , sweet lord , You know the goodness I intend upon you .
I am right loath to go .
Well , sir , we will not .
That you must teach me .
And your horse now would make him an ass .
Shall I strike now ?
Faith , there has been much to do on both sides , and the nation holds it no sin to tar them to controversy .
To leave his wife , to leave his babes , His mansion and his titles in a place From whence himself does fly ?
And come you now with "knocking at the gate" ?
They sit conferring by the parlor fire .
I'll fetch the general's surgeon. , Save you your labor. , He that lies slain here , Cassio , Was my dear friend .
The sun not yet thy sighs from heaven clears , Thy old groans ring yet in my ancient ears .
So kind a father ! , Be my horses ready ?
How many fond fools serve mad jealousy !
I crave your highness' pardon .
Would I were assured Of my condition .
Let go !
Is 't possible ?
Shall we go , coz ?
Thou canst not frown , thou canst not look askance , Nor bite the lip as angry wenches will , Nor hast thou pleasure to be cross in talk .
Who ?
Why , how now ?
When they shall see The face of Caesar , they are vanished .
God's will and His pleasure , Captain , I beseech you now , come apace to the king .
If it will please Caesar To be so good to Caesar as to hear me , I shall beseech him to befriend himself .
And a chain , that you once wore , about his neck .
And fair words to them .
I must away this night toward Padua , And it is meet I presently set forth .
Companion , hence !
That's twice .
I have it , Tranio !
Lo , yonder , and Titinius mourning it .
Grieve not that I am fall'n to this for you , For herein Fortune shows herself more kind Than is her custom .
Look you , the worm is not to be trusted but in the keeping of wise people , for indeed there is no goodness in the worm .
The Lord in heaven bless thee , noble Harry !
I repent me much That so I harried him .
I marvel why I answered not again .
Is 't not your trick ?
Shall Caesar send a lie ?
This grief is crowned with consolation .
Why then , your ambition makes it one .
I'll help you to a horse .
What three things does drink especially provoke ?
Let this be so .
Doth thy other mouth call me ?
Nay , but the devil take mocking .
Where is this sight ?
With what I get , I mean , and so do they .
If I do not put on a sober habit , Talk with respect and swear but now and then , Wear prayer books in my pocket , look demurely , Nay more .
O , what cause have I , Thine being but a moiety of my moan , To overgo thy woes and drown thy cries !
But who comes here ?
On , on , on , on , on !
Bid him bring his pen and inkhorn to the jail .
Belong you to the Lady Olivia , friends ?
Why , doth not every earthly thing Cry shame upon her ?
Claribel .
Think you I am no stronger than my sex , Being so fathered and so husbanded ?
Oh , withered is the garland of the war .
The citizens are up , and Tybalt slain .
Where is my love ?
And so they parted .
Here cease more questions .
He will come straight .
Seest not ?
And he that hath commanded is our king .
But how long shall that title "ever" last ?
Fie , thou dishonest Satan !
I will unto Venice To buy apparel 'gainst the wedding day .
The weight of this sad time we must obey .
I will help you to 't .
Kill men i ' th ' dark !
No .
I never looked for better at his hands After he once fell in with Mistress Shore .
I'll tell thee how Beatrice praised thy wit he other day .
Oh , the people in the street cry "Romeo , " Some "Juliet , " and some "Paris , " and all run With open outcry toward our monument .
See where they come .
Thou 'rt mad to say it .
Sooth , madam , I hear nothing .
None of these rogues and cowards But Ajax is their fool .
Yet fortune can not recompense me better Than to die well , and not my master's debtor .
Twill be heavier soon by the weight of a man .
O spite of spites !
This is all .
Yet if you there Did practice on my state , your being in Egypt Might be my question .
Y'are a baggage , the Slys are no rogues .
Am I that name , Iago ?
Think'st thou I'd make a life of jealousy , To follow still the changes of the moon With fresh suspicions ?
And you , sir .
Moreover that we much did long to see you , The need we have to use you did provoke Our hasty sending .
Well moused , Lion !
And if thou prate of mountains let them throw Millions of acres on us , till our ground , Singeing his pate against the burning zone , Make Ossa like a wart !
Touch her soft mouth , and march .
This is some monster of the isle with four legs who hath got , as I take it , an ague .
He does smile his face into more lines than is in the new map with the augmentation of the Indies .
Right , I mean you .
Knock , knock , knock !
O , now let Richmond and Elizabeth , The true succeeders of each royal house , By God's fair ordinance conjoin together , And let their heirs , God , if thy will be so .
What shall we do else ?
O God of battles , steel my soldiers ' hearts .
I serve as good a man as you .
Thou art a fool .
Not I , my lord .
That you have wronged me doth appear in this : You have condemned and noted Lucius Pella For taking bribes here of the Sardians , Wherein my letters , praying on his side Because I knew the man , were slighted off .
You shall hear more .
This prince hath neither claimed it nor deserved it And therefore , in mine opinion , can not have it .
It makes us , or it mars us .
Therefore , good Brutus , be prepared to hear .
I am even The natural fool of fortune .
I'll make one too .
Why , what did I ?
I did not give the lie .
Believe me , sir , had I such venture forth , The better part of my affections would Be with my hopes abroad .
O Stephano , two Neapolitans 'scaped !
First , I must tell thee this : Desdemona is directly in love with him .
What , bear her in hand until they come to take hands and then , with public accusation , uncovered slander , unmitigated rancor , O God , that I were a man !
How now , masters ?
Good gentle one , give me modest assurance if you be the lady of the house , that I may proceed in my speech .
Why , she comes to borrow nothing of them .
In faith , he's penitent , And yet his trespass , in our common reason ( Save that , they say , the wars must make example Out of her best ) is not , almost , a fault T ' incur a private check .
No , he doth but mistake the truth totally .
Why , whose is it ?
I saw Bassanio and Antonio part .
I tell you what you shall do .
My lord it shall be done .
Come hither , captain .
If our sport had gone forward , we had all been made men .
Sure , 'tis not so .
The duke must grant me that .
Here , catch this casket .
I give them with this ring , Which when you part from , lose , or give away , Let it presage the ruin of your love
A quarrel , ho , already ?
Patience , I say .
I can not tell wat is dat .
I'll cross it though it blast me. , Stay , illusion !
Ergo , Master Launcelot .
Madam , it so fell out , that certain players We o'erraught on the way .
Give me a living reason she's disloyal .
Have you the chain about you ?
His father was called Philip of Macedon , as I take it .
I'll not fail , if I live .
She's busy , and she can not come ! " Is that an answer ?
Let not that doctor e'er come near my house !
Ink and paper , Charmian .
All these old witnesses , I can not err , Tell me thou art my son Antipholus .
The power of Caesar , and His power unto Octavia .
What's a drunken man like , fool ?
If it be true that good wine needs no bush , 'tis true that a good play needs no epilogue .
I .
I have seen thee fight When I have envied thy behavior .
Thy name is Gloucester .
Why , that were covetousness .
But fare you well .
Sure it is hers .
O Ratcliffe , I have dreamed a fearful dream !
My voice is now the king's , my looks mine own .
What have I kept back ?
And look to have it yielded with all kindness .
By and by .
How can it be ?
They have made him drink alms-drink .
How am I then a villain To counsel Cassio to this parallel course , Directly to his good ?
I have been to seek you .
If I do not usurp myself , I am .
Made it for me , sir ?
But I have none .
Arise , arise , Awake the snorting citizens with the bell Or else the devil will make a grandsire of you .
Will it be ever thus ?
Unless the master were the man .
Help , ho !
And doth affection breed it ?
Observe how Antony becomes his flaw , And what thou think'st his very action speaks In every power that moves .
My lord ?
I know you by the waggling of your head .
Soundly , my lord .
Witless else her son .
I am sped .
You speak all your part at once , cues and all. , Pyramus , enter .
Thou but rememberest me of mine own conception .
What a strange drowsiness possesses them !
Note if your lady strain his entertainment
I know not , madam .
Of thirty sail .
It is very hot .
I think the world's asleep .
Inquire me out some mean poor gentleman , Whom I will marry straight to Clarence ' daughter .
I'll put it on .
I warrant something from Venice .
No , Caesar hath it not .
O , cry your mercy , sir. , Tom's a-cold .
They are in the very wrath of love , and they will together .
She turned to folly , and she was a whore .
Noble Antony , not sickness should detain me .
Here comes Baptista .
God has given you one face and you make yourselves another .
With him I sent the queen , My reason all the same , and they are ready Tomorrow or at further space t ' appear Where you shall hold your session .
I'll pay thy pleasure then .
But come thy ways .
Look , where he comes .
I shall be constrained in 't to call thee knave , knight .
O Antony !
Aye , sir .
We'll keep no great ado , a friend or two .
Who's there ?
A pleasing cordial , princely Buckingham , Is this thy vow unto my sickly heart .
No , my good knight .
I did not .
Prepare the body then , and follow us .
He takes on him to understand so much , and therefore comes to speak with you .
This the Dauphin speaks .
I pray you , go Along with me .
I do beseech your lordship , call her back .
Out of my sight !
So thou , that hast no unkind mate to grieve thee , With urging helpless patience would relieve me ; But , if thou live to see like right bereft , This fool-begged patience in thee will be left .
Ah , let be , let be !
Come , bring us , bring us where he is .
I warrant it will .
Not a word .
Virtue that transgresses is but patched with sin , and sin that amends is but patched with virtue .
They'll tell all .
Or would you have me speak after my custom , as being a professed tyrant to their sex ?
Beshrew his soul for me !
Ah , how much might the man deserve of me that would right her !
And you shall speak In the same pulpit whereto I am going , After my speech is ended .
Nor in thine , lord .
All the East , Say thou , shall call her mistress." So he nodded , And soberly did mount an arm-gaunt steed , Who neighed so high that what I would have spoke Was beastly dumbed by him .
Alas , poor hurt fowl , now will he creep into sedges .
For what reason ?
You'll not endure him !
Here , Peter Quince .
Why , we shall make him mad indeed .
I say , O Caesar , Antony is dead .
An eagle , madam , Hath not so green , so quick , so fair an eye As Paris hath .
And mine , to eke out hers .
O Clitus !
That's all one : has hurt me , and there's the end on 't .
A right fair mark , fair coz , is soonest hit .
And now you know my meaning .
Indeed , the French may lay twenty French crowns to one they will beat us , for they bear them on their shoulders .
I will expect you .
Hark .
Ready .
Go to my chamber , put on clothes of mine .
With Rosaline , my ghostly Father ?
What's the news ?
This week he hath been heavy , sour , sad , And much different from the man he was .
Which is one ?
Since no man of aught he leaves knows , what is 't to leave betimes ?
Went he hence now ?
There is means , madam .
Where lies your text ?
Yet I suppose him virtuous , know him noble , Of great estate , of fresh and stainless youth .
What a thrice-double ass Was I , to take this drunkard for a god And worship this dull fool !
What gentleman ?
Get thee to bed .
For she his hairy temples then had rounded With a coronet of fresh and fragrant flowers , And that same dew , which sometime on the buds Was wont to swell like round and orient pearls , Stood now within the pretty flowerets ' eyes Like tears that did their own disgrace bewail .
Set your heart at rest .
Out upon you !
Come , will you go with me ?
Carried to Colmekill , The sacred storehouse of his predecessors , And guardian of their bones .
Orsino , this is that Antonio That took the And this is he that did the When your young nephew Titus lost his leg .
Let me entreat you .
Harpier cries , "'Tis time , 'tis time." Round about the cauldron go , In the poisoned entrails throw .
Thou hast served me with much faith .
Eight wild boars roasted whole at a breakfast , and but twelve persons there !
We have not yet set down this day of triumph .
I'll tell thee what , Prince : a college of wit-crackers can not flout me out of my humor .
What counterfeit did I give you ?
It shall be so .
Ay , my good lord .
By my troth , I will speak my conscience of the king .
And in good time , Here comes Sir Richard Ratcliffe and the duke .
Good shepherd , tell this youth what 'tis to love .
I fear 'tis choleric .
Safer than trust too far .
Why , what a king is this !
White-livered runagate , what doth he there ?
You will compel me , then , to read the will ?
To Ireland , I .
I humbly thank you .
All hell shall stir for this .
Prithee say true !
We'll know all our fortunes .
You are my true and honorable wife , As dear to me as are the ruddy drops That visit my sad heart .
Tis like the howling of Irish wolves against the moon .
Who knows not he is dead !
Had I been any god of power , I would Have sunk the sea within the earth or ere It should the good ship so have swallowed and The fraughting souls within her .
If he distaste it , let him to our sister , Whose mind and mine I know in that are one , Not to be overruled .
To make you answer truly to your name .
Beloved Regan , Thy sister's naught .
Fortune pursue thee !
Nay , but I know who loves him .
Do you put tricks upon 's with savages and men of Ind , ha ?
These Moors are changeable in their wills , fill thy purse with money .
And tell me now , sweet friend , what happy gale Blows you to Padua here from old Verona ?
By foul play , as thou sayst , were we heaved thence , But blessedly holp hither .
My ships come home a month before the day .
Come on .
This sight would make him do a desperate turn , Yea , curse his better angel from his side And fall to reprobation .
In every good thing .
He is afeard to come .
I did hear The galloping of horse .
I would not change it .
Now , by Apollo , Now , by Apollo , King , Thou swear'st thy gods in vain .
Of what personage and years is he ?
Then thou art damned .
Did not you tell me I should know the man By the Athenian garment he had on ?
The time will bring it out .
Will money buy 'em ?
Antonio , I arrest thee at the suit of Count Orsino .
But what talk we of fathers when there is such a man as Orlando ?
Well , I will marry one day , but to try .
How sound is she asleep !
Know him ?
Or if not so , then here I hit it right : Our Romeo hath not been in bed tonight .
Tis certain , every man that dies ill , the ill upon his own head .
And , as he fell , did Romeo turn and fly .
Take hence this jack and whip him .
I know he loves me well .
Mark how he trembles in his ecstasy .
Lend thine ear .
Nurse , where's my daughter ?
If this letter move him not , his legs can not .
Not sick , my lord , unless it be in mind , Nor well , unless in mind .
God 'i ' good e'en .
Oh , that my prayers could such affection move !
Dishonor not your mothers .
I do wander everywhere Swifter than the moon's sphere .
Who's there ?
He's safe for these three hours .
The meantime , lady , I'll raise the preparation of a war Shall stain your brother .
No .
A second Daniel ! , A Daniel , Jew !
Then leave her , sir , for by the power that made me , I tell you all her wealth .

But it is no English treason to cut French crowns , and tomorrow the king himself will be a clipper .
If you desire the spleen , and will laugh yourself into stitches , follow me .
Behold , there stand the caskets , noble Prince .
It seems that you scorn me .
You sunburnt sicklemen of August weary , Come hither from the furrow and be merry .
Hark , they roar .
Marry , sir , to bid my old master the Jew to sup tonight with my new master the Christian .
If ever he have wife , let her be made More miserable by the death of him Than I am made by my poor lord and thee. , Come now towards Chertsey with your holy load , Taken from Paul's to be interred there .
Here comes my messenger. , How now , mad spirit ?
God hath blessed you with a good name .
O these deliberate fools !
Caesar did write for him to come to Rome .
Imperious Caesar , dead and turned to clay , Might stop a hole to keep the wind away .
Here comes the noble Antony .
Or be alive again , And dare me to the desert with thy sword .
But she as far surpasseth Sycorax As great'st does least .
Saw you the weird sisters ?
I shall answer for her .
Oh , let their bodies follow , my dear liege , With blood and sword and fire to win your right , In aid whereof we of the spiritualty Will raise your Highness such a mighty sum As never did the clergy at one time Bring in to any of your ancestors .
I do believe that these applauses are For some new honors that are heaped on Caesar .
How fares your grace ?
She is stirring , sir .
Jailer , look to him .
But here my father comes .
What a plague means my niece , to take the death of her brother thus ?
God defend me from these two !
I must be gone .
But on thy side I may not be too forward , Lest , being seen , thy brother , tender George , Be executed in his father's sight .
Your goods that lay at host , sir , in the Centaur .
I am he .
Hath Romeo slain himself ?
Will either of you bear me a challenge to him ?
Turn the sands into eloquent tongues , and my horse is argument for them all .
That I beheld .
Wilt thou change fathers ?
When didst thou sleep when such a deed was done ?
Thus from my lips , by thine , my sin is purged .
Farewell , and thanks .
But let it rest. , Now , Litio , to you .
I found not Cassio's kisses on her lips .
If I let him go , The debt he owes will be required of me .
Please it your grace , on to the state affairs .
Give me some wine and let me speak a little .
Enough , Captain .
Thus says my king : "Say thou to Harry of England , though we seemed dead , we did but sleep .
What else ?
Out upon her !
Well , well , thou hast a careful father , child .
Who sent you hither ?
Sweet friends , to bed .
Anon , as patient as the female dove When that her golden couplets are disclosed , His silence will sit drooping .
If I should say , I saw such islanders , For , certes , these are people of the island , Who , though they are of monstrous shape , yet note , Their manners are more gentle-kind than of Our human generation you shall find Many , nay , almost any .
But , as I can learn , He hearkens after prophecies and dreams , And from the crossrow plucks the letter And says a wizard told him that by "G" His issue disinherited should be .
Let us withdraw .
This is as uncivil as strange .
What's your gracious pleasure ?
I am sure of that .
And , I think , if my breast had not been made of faith , and my heart of steel , She had transformed me to a curtal dog and made me turn i ' th ' wheel .
In such a night Did young Lorenzo swear he loved her well , Stealing her soul with many vows of faith , And ne'er a true one .
Are you my wife and will not call me "husband" ?
Even those you were wont to take delight in , the tragedians of the city .
Come , lords , will you go To comfort Edward with our company ?
I dare not drink yet , madam .
But , good Laertes , Will you do this , keep close within your chamber .
She is thine own. , What , Ariel !
Then you'll buy 'em to sell again .
Le Roy ?
So get you hence in peace .
I can not tell what you and other men Think of this life , but , for my single self , I had as lief not be as live to be In awe of such a thing as I myself .
Disorder , that hath spoiled us , friend us now .
Thou shalt find That I'll resume the shape which thou dost think I have cast off for ever .
Fall and cease .
Thou chid'st me oft for loving Rosaline .
Old I do wax , and from my weary limbs Honor is cudgeled .
Good fool , for my brother's death .
My dearest cousin and my dearer lord ?
Why , then , I care not for thee .
I'll assure you , he uttered as prave words at the pridge as you shall see in a summer's day .
The gown is made Just as my master had direction .
That a woman conceived me , I thank her .
My house was at the Phoenix ?
I am bound to the Count Orsino's court .
What is amiss ?
Thy evil spirit , Brutus .
Why , "some are born great , some achieve greatness , and some have greatness thrown upon them." I was one , sir , in this interlude , one Sir Topas , sir , but that's all one .
That's two of his weapons .
I am dying , Egypt , dying .
But they'll nor pinch , Fright me with urchin-shows , pitch me i ' th ' mire , Nor lead me like a firebrand in the dark Out of my way , unless he bid 'em .
That 'scuse serves many men to save their gifts .
I will meditate the while upon some horrid message for a challenge .
Oh , they take the part of a better wrestler than myself .
And thus it may be .
The duke and senators of Venice greet you .
I once more take my leave .
I say "thy husband" , dost understand the word ?
Oh , whither hast thou led me , Egypt ?
Why so ? , Ay , that way goes the game .
So let it be with Caesar .
It would seem strange unto him when he waked .
A challenge , on my life .
Think'st thou the fiery fever will go out With titles blown from adulation ?
By the Lord , madam , you wrong me , and the world shall know it .
Chopped logic !
I pray you , leave me .
You have not seen such a thing as 'tis .
You have obtained it .
He grows worse and worse .
It hath not appeared .
Call my sister so .
The next thing then she waking looks upon , Be it on lion , bear , or wolf , or bull , On meddling monkey or on busy ape , She shall pursue it with the soul of love .
Yes , it is apparel .
Sir !
Sure we thank you .
Farewell .
Now , gods , stand up for bastards !
Oh , fie upon thee , strumpet !
I can tell thee where that saying was born , of "I fear no colors." Where , good Mistress Mary ?
Good Signior Angelo , you must excuse us all ; My wife is shrewish when I keep not hours .
All my reports go with the modest truth , Nor more , nor clipped , but so .
Oh !
For they were parted With foul and violent tempest .
Shake ! " quoth the dovehouse .
Who am I , sir ?
Alas , poor country !
Sister , it is not a little I have to say of what most nearly appertains to us both .
O God ! , O Nurse , how shall this be prevented ?
Four days will quickly steep themselves in night .
His name !
I must to the barber's , monsieur , for methinks I am marvelous hairy about the face .
A whole one , I .
Remember me .
What is your pleasure ?
How now , Malvolio ?
Fool , do not flatter .
I guess at it .
Oh , heaven have mercy on me !
Parted you in good terms ?
Who riseth from a feast With that keen appetite that he sits down ?
This is kind I offer .
And let us swear our resolution .
How may that be ?
Upon condition Publius shall not live , Who is your sister's son , Mark Antony .
All the world desires her .
Come , bring me where they are .
Come , Let's have one other gaudy night .
Her name , that was as fresh As Dian's visage , is now begrimed and black As mine own face .
Tis marvel , but that you are but newly come , You might have heard it else proclaimed about .
Conduct me to mine host .
He speaks home , madam .
It is so .
What effects , my lord ?
Look , when I vow , I weep .
No , he hath simply the best wit of any handicraft man in Athens .
No greater heart in thee ?
Faith , I'll home tomorrow , Sir Toby .
Love give me strength , and strength shall help afford .
Your name , I pray you , friend ?
My lord , the queen would speak with you , and presently .
Petruchio , go thy ways ; the field is won .
I do not know One of my sex , no woman's face remember , Save , from my glass , mine own .
Will you go hear this news , Signior ?
I would not for the world they saw thee here .
He knows not what he says , and vain it is That we present us to him .
Unwilling , I agreed .
Yet once again proclaim it publicly , If any friend will pay the sum for him , He shall not die ; so much we tender him .
And that I am he Let me a little show it even in this : That I was constant Cimber should be banished , And constant do remain to keep him so .
Have you not hurt your head ?
The obscure bird Clamored the livelong night .
Fare you well .
Well thought upon .
Your praise is come too swiftly home before you .
Would it not make one weep ?
Take thou the bill , give me thy mete- yard , and spare not me .
I do love nothing in the world so well as you .
Free from the bondage you are in , Messala .
In which regard ,
I would it might be hangers till then .
And therefore 'tis called a sensible tale .
Bemonster not thy feature .
Are you drawn forth among a world of men To slay the innocent ?
You are early stirring .
An honest mind and plain , he must speak truth .
Tis well consented .
Thus may we gather honey from the weed And make a moral of the devil himself .
No , madam .
Dost thou lie so low ?
I am all the daughters of my father's house , And all the brothers too , and yet I know not .
So were their daggers , which unwiped we found Upon their pillows .
Though to have her and death were both one thing .
Why ?
Malvolio's coming down this walk .
Go with me and see What I can show in this .
And he did bid us follow to the temple .
Do you quarrel , sir ?
Soldier , why wear'st thou that glove in thy cap ?
Shame of ladies , sisters !
Good Enobarbus , 'tis a worthy deed , And shall become you well , to entreat your captain To soft and gentle speech .
No blown ambition doth our arms incite , But love , dear love ! , and our aged father's right .
If any be Trinculo's legs , these are they .
There's money for thee .
What , in the midst of the street ?
Thou shalt not die .
Look , love , what envious streaks Do lace the severing clouds in yonder east .
I know what reason I have to think so : if thou shouldst not be glad , I would divorce me from thy mother's tomb , Sepulchring an adultress .
His word is more than the miraculous harp .
See where she comes and brings your froward wives As prisoners to her womanly persuasion. , Katherine , that cap of yours becomes you not .
Your love says , like an honest gentleman , 'Where is your mother ?
Wrong hath but wrong , and blame the due of blame .
Princes and counties !
The wall , methinks , being sensible , should curse again .
Tis not a time for private stomaching .
What means that bloody knife ?
O Margaret , Margaret , now thy heavy curse Is lighted on poor Hastings ' wretched head .
Do but read .
Play the men .
Oh , now you weep , and , I perceive , you feel The dint of pity .
What is 't , Ophelia , he hath said to you ?
Oh my fair warrior !
Take up those cords. , Poor ropes , you are beguiled , Both you and I , for Romeo is exiled .
Go to .
Ill spirit , I would hold more talk with thee .
Or any of your faction ?
Did he confess it ?
No , Pompey , I have kept me from the cup .
Farewell , my Desdemona .
What shall I call thee when thou art a man ?
For I can give his humor the true bent , And I will bring him to the Capitol .
Who does do you wrong ?
You lack a man's heart .
God will revenge it , whom I will importune With earnest prayers , all to that effect .
How if they will not ?
Where I have come , great clerks have purposed To greet me with premeditated welcomes , Where I have seen them shiver and look pale , Make periods in the midst of sentences , Throttle their practiced accent in their fears , And in conclusion dumbly have broke off , Not paying me a welcome .
I have a daughter .
As freely , son , as God did give her me .
Niggard of question , but of our demands Most free in his reply .
Let life be short , else shame will be too long .
Nay , an you be a cursing hypocrite once , you must be looked to .
Pronounce it for me , sir , to all our friends , For my heart speaks they are welcome .
I do think there is mettle in death , which commits some loving act upon her , she hath such a celerity in dying .
Sweet Beatrice , wouldst thou come when I called thee ?
Dear my lord , Be not familiar with her .
Truly , sir , in respect of a fine workman , I am but , as you would say , a cobbler .
Why , your lieutenant , Cassio .
Maybe he is not well .
Welcome , dear Rosencrantz and Guildenstern .
Oh , quick , or I am gone .
The duke be here tonight ?
I'll mend it and then play , Where's the Queen ?
No man's life was to be trusted with them .
Count , take of me my daughter , and with her my fortunes .
And let his knights have colder looks among you .
How doth the prince ?
Come , thou day in night , For thou wilt lie upon the wings of night Whiter than new snow upon a raven's back .
I am bound to thee forever .
Go , borrow me a crow .
Within this three mile may you see it coming ; I say , a moving grove .
Hear me for my cause , and be silent that you may hear .
How dost thou and thy master agree ?
I am thus bold to put your Grace in mind Of what you promised me .
The residue of your fortune Go to my cave and tell me. , Good old man , Thou art right welcome as thy master is .
Sweet Bassanio , my ships have all miscarried .
Stand from the body .
Put color in thy cheek .
Well , what is it ?
What need one ?
Piece out our imperfections with your thoughts .
Now set the teeth and stretch the nostril wide , Hold hard the breath and bend up every spirit To his full height .
Who comes here ?
I like him not , nor stands it safe with us To let his madness range .
Poor prattler , how thou talk'st !
Tomorrow , sir , I wrestle for my credit , and he that escapes me without some broken limb shall acquit him well .
Nor send you out o ' th ' way ?
Myself and what is mine to you and yours Is now converted .
Nor you , as we are , loyal .
If much you note him , You shall offend him and extend his passion .

Call the messenger .
I am content , so thou wilt have it so .
If I owe you anything , I will pay you in cudgels .
How say you by the French lord , Monsieur le Bon ?
Here at your service .
Then shall the sighs of Octavia blow the fire up in Caesar , and , as I said before , that which is the strength of their amity shall prove the immediate author of their variance .
And you shall be satisfied .
What do you mean To dote thus on such luggage ?
A messenger from the galleys .
Obey thy parents , keep thy word's justice , swear not , commit not with man's sworn spouse , set not thy sweet heart on proud array .
All that I will tell you is that the duke hath dined .
Write to him , I will subscribe , gentle adieus and greetings .
You take my life When you do take the means whereby I live .
As love is , my lord , before it loves .
Portia , forgive me this enforced wrong , And in the hearing of these many friends I swear to thee , even by thine own fair eyes Wherein I see myself , Mark you but that !
Now , beshrew my father's ambition !
Therefore You will not pay for the glasses you have burst ?
You were kneeled to and importuned otherwise By all of us , and the fair soul herself Weighed between loathness and obedience , at Which end o ' th ' beam should bow .
My sister may receive it much more worse To have her gentleman abused , assaulted For following her affairs. , Put in his legs .
Cousins , I hope the days are near at hand That chambers will be safe .
What do you call the play ?
You would say so , master , if your garments were thin .
If you will not murder me for my love , let me be your servant .
If you would take the pains but to examine the wars of Pompey the Great , you shall find , I warrant you , that there is no tiddle toddle nor pibble babble in Pompey's camp .
Wast born i ' th ' forest here ?
Tis truly so .
When did I see thee so put down ?
If swift thought break it not , a swifter mean Shall outstrike thought , but thought will do 't , I feel .
I'll torture him .
Shake off this downy sleep , death's counterfeit , And look on death itself !
And so , God be with him !
God send you joy , Petruchio .
Didst thou not kill this king ?
Ere I would say I would drown myself for the love of a guinea hen , I would change my humanity with a baboon .
Notable pirate !
Have you no wit , manners , nor honesty but to gabble like tinkers at this time of night ?
When it is paid , bring your true friend along .
God and your arms be praised , victorious friends !
Now he tells how she plucked him to my chamber .
Why did he so ?
So you may put a man in your belly .
Or here , or at the Capitol .
Good morrow , worthy Caesar .
To the breach , to the breach !
How is't with you , sir ?
Stay not , be gone .
Finish , good lady .
Tush , I may as well say the fool's the fool .
Kind and dear princess !
Much castigation , exercise devout , For here's a young and sweating devil here , That commonly rebels .
I hate the word , As I hate hell , all Montagues , and thee .
How should they , when that wise men have no eyes ?
My lord , the mayor of London comes to greet you .
I'll not budge an inch , boy .
I shall return before your Lordship thence .
She's the worse for all this .
Good my lord , tell it .
Will 't please you taste of what is here ?
I have been your tenant and your father's tenant these fourscore years .
She was too fond of her most filthy bargain .
Do you speak in the sick tune ?
When could they say till now , that talked of Rome , That her wide walks encompassed but one man ?
I'll talk with this good fellow .
Let us therefore eat and drink .
You know that you are Brutus that speak this , Or , by the gods , this speech were else your last .
I dare swear this is the right Vincentio .
Mark Antony , Pardon me , Caius Cassius .
My services which I have done the signiory Shall out-tongue his complaints .
Why , love , I say .
Hence .
Play with your fancies and in them behold , Upon the hempen tackle , shipboys climbing .
But you'll lie like dogs , and yet say nothing neither .
I will not have to do with you .
As plain as I see you now .
Death's the end of all .
I think our country sinks beneath the yoke .
Be it so , Lysander .
My son Came then into my mind , and yet my mind Was then scarce friends with him .
I prithee take the cork out of thy mouth , that I may drink thy tidings .
Twill be naught , But let it be .
They say you are a melancholy fellow .

Thy mother was a piece of virtue and She said thou wast my daughter .
Is this the poultice for my aching bones ?
Hymen from heaven brought her , Yea , brought her hither , That thou mightst join her hand with his Whose heart within his bosom is .
Oh , it came o'er my ear like the sweet sound , That breathes upon a bank of violets , Stealing and giving odor .
Go to .
What is he for a fool that betroths himself to unquietness ?
What was th ' impediment that broke this off ?
Tomorrow , my lord .
You are a counterfeit cowardly knave .
No , forbear .
Tis bitter cold , And I am sick at heart .
How much better is it to weep at joy than to joy at weeping !
Either be patient and entreat me fair , Or with the clamorous report of war Thus will I drown your exclamations .
Albeit you have deserved High commendation , true applause , and love , Yet such is now the duke's condition That he misconsters all that you have done .
Come you , sir .
As willingly as e'er I came from school .
I think so too .
Most absolute lord , My mistress Cleopatra sent me to thee .
In the same figure like the king that's dead .
Therefore should every soldier in the wars do as every sick man in his bed : wash every mote out of his conscience .
What can he say in this ?
And I am witness with her that she did .
Yet I hate not Orlando .
I think it freely , and betimes in the morning I will beseech the virtuous Desdemona to undertake for me .
She thanked me And bade me , if I had a friend that loved her , I should but teach him how to tell my story And that would woo her .
How may we try it further ?
I think the sun where he was born Drew all such humors from him .
Discern'st thou aught in that ?
If you prove a mutineer , the next tree .
No .
Shall I descend ?
So young and so untender ?
I am mightily abused .
Mine eyes did sicken at the sight and could not Endure a further view .
Go fetch My best attires .
And to that end , sir , I will welcome you .
Orlando doth commend him to you both , And to that youth he calls his Rosalind He sends this bloody napkin .
Think of it .
Look who comes here .
The more my wrong , the more his spite appears .
Use Desdemona well .
But Antonio is certainly undone .
Romeo , will you come to your father's ?
But first I'll turn yon fellow in his grave And then return lamenting to my love .
Do Poor Tom some charity , whom the foul fiend vexes .
There , take it to you , trenchers , cups , and all !
Do , I prithee , but yet have the grace to consider that tears do not become a man .
Therefore , out of my love to you , I came hither to acquaint you withal , that either you might stay him from his intendment or brook such disgrace well as he shall run into , in that it is a thing of his own search and altogether against my will .
He bounds from the earth , as if his entrails were hairs , le cheval volant , the Pegasus , qui a les narines de feu .
I'll strike and cry , "Take all." Well said .
A piece of ice .
Not having that which , having , makes them short .
Fie , how my bones ache !
Honest Nurse , farewell .
I can not wish the fault undone , the issue of it being so proper .
O true , good Catesby .
Therefore play , music. , Prince , thou art sad .
But saying o'er what I have said before .
Not very well , but I have met him oft , And he hath bought the cottage and the bounds That the old carlot once was master of .
Be silent .
They are beaten , sir , and our advantage serves For a fair victory .
Come hither , mistress .
As sweet as balm , as soft as air , as gentle , O Antony ! , Nay , I will take thee too .
Thy master and his man are here , And that is false thou dost report to us .
How intend you , "practiced" ?
She hath betrayed me and shall die the death .
The starry welkin cover thou anon With drooping fog as black as Acheron , And lead these testy rivals so astray As one come not within another's way .
Alack , 'tis he .
Let it go .
This is she , Peace , peace , Mercutio , peace !
Here , sir ! " You loggerheaded and unpolished grooms !
With an eye of green in 't .
Cleopatra , Do not abuse my master's bounty by Th' undoing of yourself .
Is Decius Brutus and Trebonius there ?
Who is it in the press that calls on me ?
I will not say you shall see a masque , but if you do then it was not for nothing that my nose fell a-bleeding on Black Monday last at six o'clock i ' th ' morning falling out that year on Ash Wednesday was four year in th ' afternoon .
Oh , I have heard him speak of that same brother , And he did render him the most unnatural That lived amongst men .
Behold where stands The usurper's cursed head .
Farewell .
I speak but brotherly of him , but should I anatomize him to thee as he is , I must blush and weep , and thou must look pale and wonder .
Against my will , I am sent to bid you come in to dinner .
Asses are made to bear , and so are you .
I'll serve you , sir , five hundred at the rate .
Let me beseech your grace not to do so .
And did not she herself revile me there ?
Be patient .
Twere damnation To think so base a thought .
Is 't true ?
I will hide me in the arbor .
No , sir , I say his horse comes , with him on his back .
But few of any sort , and none of name .
Happy is Hermia , wheresoe'er she lies , For she hath blessed and attractive eyes .
Thou dost thy office fairly .
As with the meat , some undeserved fault I'll find about the making of the bed , And here I'll fling the pillow , there the bolster , This way the coverlet , another way the sheets .
Your names ?
First , forward to the temple .
It seems he hath great care to please his wife .
And from hence I go To make these doubts all even .
Tomorrow with your earliest Let me have speech with you. , Come , my dear love , The purchase made , the fruits are to ensue : That profit's yet to come 'tween me and you .
Upon mine honor , Myself , my brother , and this grieved count Did see her , hear her , at that hour last night Talk with a ruffian at her chamber window Who hath indeed , most like a liberal villain , Confessed the vile encounters they have had A thousand times in secret .
With the help of a surgeon he might yet recover and prove an ass .
You are dull , Casca , and those sparks of life That should be in a Roman you do want , Or else you use not .
Tis very strange .
Didst thou not hear a noise ?
Let go my hand .
Now is the time of help .
Thus losers part .
Let me shun that .
Oh , what authority and show of truth Can cunning sin cover itself withal !
Go , then , for 'tis in vain To seek him here that means not to be found .
Madam , not now .
I must remove Some thousands of these logs and pile them up , Upon a sore injunction .
Due for a chain your husband had of him .
Caesar is touched .
Prithee , friend , Pour out the pack of matter to mine ear , The good and bad together .
O Iago !
I never saw you in my life till now .
Ingratitude , thou marble-hearted fiend , More hideous when thou show'st thee in a child Than the sea monster .
Let us our lives , our souls , our debts , our careful wives , our children , and our sins lay on the king !
Thanks , sir : the like to you !
He wonders to what end you have assembled Such troops of citizens to come to him , His grace not being warned thereof before .
Give us the place alone .
You are a fool .
I will be angry .
Alas the day !
But she is none .
We'll hear him what he says .
Say it is done , And I will love thee and prefer thee for it .
What is thy name ?
Yes , as sparrows eagles , or the hare the lion .
This murderous shaft that's shot Hath not yet lighted , and our safest way Is to avoid the aim .
Go , write it in a martial hand .
Oh , this is it that makes your servants droop !
If you can not , give thanks you have lived so long and make yourself ready in your cabin for the mischance of the hour , if it so hap. , Cheerly , good hearts ! , Out of our way , I say .
Mobled queen" is good .
What should the wars do with these jigging fools ?
The king has killed his heart .
Your lord does know my mind .
So Chrish save me , I will cut off your head .
They steal hearts .
All other devils that suggest by treasons Do botch and bungle up damnation With patches , colors , and with forms being fetched From glist'ring semblances of piety .
I'll call thee "Hamlet , " "King , " "Father , " "royal Dane." O , answer me !
He says so , Tranio ?
I grant you .
O , fear me not .
I was not born to die on Brutus ' sword .
Nothing , my lord , or if , I know not what .
But we are prevented .
But that thy strange mutations make us hate thee , Life would not yield to age .
Moonshine and Lion are left to bury the dead .
My Lord of Gloucester , I have too long borne Your blunt upbraidings and your bitter scoffs .
No more but e'en a woman , and commanded By such poor passion as the maid that milks And does the meanest chares .
Nine or ten times I had thought t ' have yerked him here under the ribs .
O , good sir , I do .
He dares not come there for the candle .
The most exquisite Claudio ?
Yea , is the worst well ?
Master young man , you , I pray you , which is the way to Master Jew's ?
What is the matter , husband ?
And she is mine , and all my right of her I do estate unto Demetrius .
Here , Signior Tranio , This bird you aimed at , though you hit her not. , Therefore a health to all that shot and missed .
The elements be kind to thee and make Thy spirits all of comfort !
Will you enforce me to a world of cares ?
A match !
lie on her ?
It can not be .
What , not a word ?
If you do sorrow at my grief in love , By giving love your sorrow and my grief Were both extermined .
What a caterwauling do you keep here !
And so it is , truly , and very notably discharged .
I humbly beseech you , proceed to th ' affairs of state .
And of women .
Come , sister. , Shepherdess , look on him better , And be not proud .
They are pitiful .
Not that Adam that kept the Paradise , but that Adam that keeps the prison ; he that goes in the calf's skin that was killed for the Prodigal ; he that came behind you , sir , like an evil angel , and bid you forsake your liberty .
Yes , the fashion is the fashion .
As I intend to prosper and repent , So thrive I in my dangerous affairs Of hostile arms !
It shall be done , my lord .
We would so , and then go a-batfowling .
What is "t o"clock ?
Call my guard , I prithee .
I have broke with her father and his goodwill obtained .
Beshrew me but I love her heartily .
Fled to his house amazed .
I'll see no more .
Saw you the king today , my lord of Derby ?
No , he's in Tartar limbo , worse than hell .
Sir , being his knave , I will .
Thou dost not wish more help from England , coz ?
Since I am crept in favor with myself , I will maintain it with some little cost .
What you know , you know .
What is your will ?
Away , Tybalt .
Ay , and a subtle , as he most learnedly delivered .
A right good markman !
It was .
I hoped there was no need to trouble himself with any such thoughts yet .
Ay , those attires are best .
I'll bring my wood home faster .
Make me not offended In your distrust .
Sure ones , then .
I saw him yesterday" , or "t ' other day , " Or then , or then , with such or such , "and , as you say , There was he gaming , there o'ertook in's rouse , There falling out at tennis , " or , perchance , "I saw him enter such a house of sale" , Your bait of falsehood takes this carp of truth .
I go , sir , but I would not have you to think that my desire of having is the sin of covetousness .
The ancient saying is no heresy .
Make assay .
Now do you know the reason of this haste .
Fare you well .
Look where he comes .
Tis he .
I want more uncles here to welcome me .
Is he pursued ?
Have all his ventures failed ?
Cold , cold , my girl , Even like thy chastity .
Indeed , he plied them both with excellent praises .
Doth not the day break here ?
Most monsterlike be shown For poor'st diminutives , for dolts , and let Patient Octavia plow thy visage up With her prepared nails !
Then if he lose he makes a swanlike end , Fading in music .
I will set down what comes from her , to satisfy my remembrance the more strongly .
Sir , you speak nobly .
What foul play had we that we came from thence ?
That "banished , " that one word "banished" Hath slain ten thousand Tybalts .
That was in thy rage .
Alack , I love myself .
Be Kent unmannerly When Lear is mad .
Shall we sound him ?
Well , peace be with you .
Fear it , my dear sister , And keep you in the rear of your affection , Out of the shot and danger of desire .
By this hand , I'll have that gown .
You see how full of changes his age is .
Peace , fool .
God be wi ' you .
I'll drink to her as long as there is a passage in my throat and drink in Illyria .
For God's sake , hold your hands .
Here comes Lorenzo .
O cruel !
What , wilt thou flout me thus unto my face , Being forbid ?
So , adieu .
Upon my sword .
Was 't you he rescued ?
From the Count Orsino , is it ?
Come hither , man .
Honest , my lord ?
But , too unruly deer , he breaks the pale And feeds from home .
Save means to live .
Why should he call her "whore" ?
This approves her letter That she would soon be here .
I am gone , though I am here .
We'll speak with thee at sea .
The messengers !
He can not flatter , he .
He longs to eat the English .
I know your favor well , Though now you have no sea-cap on your head. , Take him away .
As mine on hers , so hers is set on mine , And all combined , save what thou must combine By holy marriage .
What thou seest when thou dost wake , Do it for thy true love take .
Beat them down !
Or does he walk ?
He has deserved it , were it carbuncled Like holy Phoebus' car .
Well , for your favor , sir , why , give God thanks , and make no boast of it , and for your writing and reading , let that appear when there is no need of such vanity .
This 'tis to feel a tale , not to hear a tale .
Unless I have mista'en his colors much , Which well I am assured I have not done , His regiment lies half a mile , at least , South from the mighty power of the king .
Orsino .
Have I , Malvolio ?
Mechanic slaves With greasy aprons , rules , and hammers shall Uplift us to the view .
Wilt thou make a trust a transgression ?
Look in the calendar and bring me word .
O dolt !
What can it not ?
Your lordship is right welcome back to Denmark .
No seconds ?
Hark ye , your Romeo will be here at night .
Therefore get you on and give him his desire .
Not that , I hope , which you received of me .
By computation and mine host's report , I could not speak with Dromio since at first I sent him from the mart .
I can no more .
He's in yellow stockings .
But men may construe things after their fashion , Clean from the purpose of the things themselves .
He may command me as my sovereign , But you have power in me as in a kinsman .
Welcome home , Grumio .
The west yet glimmers with some streaks of day .
Sir Toby , I must be round with you .
My royal lord , You do not give the cheer .
For whose sake did I that ill deed ?
There let him sink , and be the seas on him !
Come , sit on me .
What will this do ?
And shall , or some of us will smart for it .
No , madam , he does nothing but smile .
Victory sits on our helms .
Ha ?
Why then , thus it is : You must prepare your bosom for his knife .
But thus , I trust , you will not marry her .
Tis new to thee .
Villain , thou liest ; for even her very words Didst thou deliver to me on the mart .
Do , good friend .
I'll to dinner .
Beshrew my very heart , I think you are happy in this second match , For it excels your first .
This my mean task Would be as heavy to me as odious , but The mistress which I serve quickens what's dead And makes my labors pleasures .
Brutus shall lead , and we will grace his heels With the most boldest and best hearts of Rome .
I saw them not .
By such despair I should accuse myself .
I'll take my leave .
I will dispatch it straight .
Thou'ld'st have , great Glamis , That which cries , "Thus thou must do , " if thou have it , And that which rather thou dost fear to do , Than wishest should be undone .
Peaseblossom .
Shine out , fair sun , till I have bought a glass , That I may see my shadow as I pass .
Now , Signior Petruchio , how speed you with my daughter ?
What would you with her , sir ?
Take that , and that .
Borachio .
I shall fall .
Go you with me and I will use your skill. , Good cousin , have a care this busy time .
Nor no man else .
What , in my sight ? , Bianca , get thee in .
Upon his royal face there is no note How dread an army hath enrounded him , Nor doth he dedicate one jot of color Unto the weary and all-watched night , But freshly looks and overbears attaint With cheerful semblance and sweet majesty , That every wretch , pining and pale before , Beholding him , plucks comfort from his looks .
How ?
Oh , villainous !
We will .
For your life you durst not .
I never saw her till this time .
I thought that all things had been savage here , And therefore put I on the countenance Of stern commandment .
Enough .
Well , Catesby , ere a fortnight make me older I'll send some packing that yet think not on 't .
Methoughts I saw a thousand fearful wracks , A thousand men that fishes gnawed upon , Wedges of gold , great anchors , heaps of pearl , Inestimable stones , unvalued jewels , All scattered in the bottom of the sea .
You must awhile be patient .
We have not spoke us yet of torchbearers .
Why , sir , he comes not .
Why did you so cry out , sirs , in your sleep ?
It is not honesty in me to speak What I have seen and known .
Your friends at Pomfret , they do need the priest ; Your Honor hath no shriving work in hand .
Himself .
Come on !
He hath an uncle here in Messina will be very much glad of it .
You stayed well by 't in Egypt .
And I remember the kissing of her batler , and the cow's dugs that her pretty chopped hands had milked .
Here's a change indeed !
Now Antony must leave her utterly .
I'll stay no longer question .
If she lives till doomsday , she'll burn a week longer than the whole world .
O , I die , Horatio .
His word might bear my wealth at any time .
We can not call her winds and waters sighs and tears .
Her name is Portia , nothing undervalued To Cato's daughter , Brutus ' Portia .
Marry , sir , with needle and thread .
For God's sake , a pot of small ale .
O fair Katherine , if you will love me soundly with your French heart , I will be glad to hear you confess it brokenly with your English tongue .
But as yet , I swear , I can not truly say how I came here .
The chain !
Hear a little further And then I'll bring thee to the present business Which now 's upon 's , without the which this story Were most impertinent .
A golden mind stoops not to shows of dross .
Come , I'll dispose of thee Among a sisterhood of holy nuns .
Take up my mistress ' gown to his master's use !
Hear you the news abroad ?
If she convey Letters to Richmond , you shall answer it .
How should that be ?
Before the time be out ?
An interlude !
Good my lord , If I have any grace or power to move you His present reconciliation take .
To th' monument !
I would thou hadst been son to some man else .
A ring he hath of mine worth forty ducats , And for the same he promised me a chain .
Besides , Antonio certified the Duke They were not with Bassanio in his ship .
Murder !
Nay , but say true , does it work upon him ?
But let your fair eyes and gentle wishes go with me to my trial , wherein , if I be foiled , there is but one shamed that was never gracious ; if killed , but one dead that was willing to be so .
Let him command , And to obey shall be in me remorse , What bloody business ever .
For my Lord Lackbeard there , he and I shall meet , and till then peace be with him .
A man , young lady !
And here my mistress .
He that will think to live till he be old , Give me some help !
For I am sick when I do look on thee .
He is not yet arrived .
Poor I am but his stale .
Sblood , an arrant traitor as any 's in the universal world , or in France , or in England !
Bear welcome in your eye , Your hand , your tongue .
Let their beds Be made as soft as yours and let their palates Be seasoned with such viands" ?
Made you my guardians , my depositaries , But kept a reservation to be followed With such a number .
My daughter tells us all .
Thou , wretched boy , that didst consort him here Shalt with him hence .
Do , young sir .
Holds it true , sir , that the Duke of Cornwall was so slain ?
He that has the two fair daughters , is 't he you mean ?
God almighty , There is some soul of goodness in things evil , Would men observingly distill it out .
I see two husbands , or mine eyes deceive me .
Adieu .
Messala !
He goes forth gallantly .
Unhappy that I am , I can not heave My heart into my mouth .
Because I would not see thy cruel nails Pluck out his poor old eyes , nor thy fierce sister In his anointed flesh stick boarish fangs .
Welcome , my good Alexas .
Can Fulvia die ?
Mere prattle without practice Is all his soldiership .
I should be angry with you if the time were convenient .
The minute of their plot Is almost come. , Well done .
Let them begin .
They are winged .
Ay , forsooth .
Thanks , good my countryman .
That ever I should call thee castaway !
Certainly , sir , I can .
Four legs and two voices , a most delicate monster .
O noble Emperor , do not fight by sea !
I said so , dear Katherine ; and I must not blush to affirm it .
Then , to answer every man directly and briefly , wisely and truly , wisely I say , I am a bachelor .
We'll bury him , and then , what's brave , what's noble , Let's do 't after the high Roman fashion And make death proud to take us .
Marry , sir , we say we are none .
Fie , what a slug is Hastings that he comes not To tell us whether they will come or no !
Be the Jacks fair within , the Jills fair without , the carpets laid , and everything in order ?
Do not answer me .
I hope , in no place so unsanctified Where such as thou mayst find him .
Oh , what learning is !
Nay , then thou lov'st it not And all my pains is sorted to no proof .
Bid them achieve me and then sell my bones .
Is Claudio thine enemy ?
We will , fair queen , up to the mountain's top , And mark the musical confusion Of hounds and echo in conjunction .
And Launcelot , soon at supper shalt thou see Lorenzo , who is thy new master's guest .
Detain no jot , I charge thee .
I shall answer that better to the commonwealth than you can the getting up of the Negro's belly .
Nor I neither .
But while I say one prayer !
No , it is struck .
If not , 'tis true this parting was well made .
Those that with haste will make a mighty fire Begin it with weak straws .
I am very proud , revengeful , ambitious , with more offences at my beck than I have thoughts to put them in , imagination to give them shape , or time to act them in .
If I were bound to divine of this unity , I would not prophesy so .
These hands do lack nobility that they strike A meaner than myself , since I myself Have given myself the cause .
And mine , but it grows something stale with me .
But if he had not been in drink , he would have tickled you othergates than he did .
Where is he ?
Ceres , most bounteous lady , thy rich leas Of wheat , rye , barley , vetches , oats , and peas ; Thy turfy mountains , where live nibbling sheep , And flat meads thatched with stover , them to keep ; Thy banks with pioned and twilled brims ,
Oh , how I love thee !
Why , i ' faith , methinks she's too low for a high praise , too brown for a fair praise , and too little for a great praise .
There are things in this comedy of Pyramus and Thisbe that will never please .
That can I .
Let's not consort with them .
Take to you no hard thoughts .
A single thing , as I am now , that wonders To hear thee speak of Naples .
Or that I had any friend would be a man for my sake !
But manhood is melted into curtsies , valor into compliment , and men are only turned into tongue , and trim ones too .
Well , Susan is with God .
Why , so didst thou .
For my brother , I think he holds you well , and in dearness of heart hath holp to effect your ensuing marriage , surely suit ill spent and labor ill bestowed .
Then thus : Baptista is safe , talking with the deceiving father of a deceitful son .
A trade , sir , that I hope I may use with a safe conscience , which is , indeed , sir , a mender of bad soles .
Where's your father ?
For Lord Hamlet , Believe so much in him that he is young , And with a larger tether may he walk Than may be given you .
For my part , I had rather bear with you than bear you .
What , art thou waking ?
Go , bid the huntsmen wake them with their horns .
I think not of them .
Oh , that she knew she were !
I passed , methought , the melancholy flood , With that sour ferryman which poets write of , Unto the kingdom of perpetual night .
Oh , 'tish ill done , 'tish ill done , by my hand , 'tish ill done .
And I in all unwillingness will go .
He hath , my lord , of late made many tenders Of his affection to me .
Even for that our love of old , I prithee , Hold thou my sword hilts , whilst I run on it .
You are not Pinch's patient , are you , sir ?
This way will I. Disrobe the images If you do find them decked with ceremonies .
O most unhappy day !
I saw him once .
Thou know'st the mask of night is on my face , Else would a maiden blush bepaint my cheek For that which thou hast heard me speak tonight .
Refuse it not .
All torment , trouble , wonder , and amazement Inhabits here .
Give me thy hand .
Thou art the thing itself .
My lord , in Athens .
He's fortified against any denial .
Oh , ho , monster , we know what belongs to a frippery. , Put off that gown , Trinculo .
I can not blame her .
Let me wipe it first .
A credulous father , and a brother noble , Whose nature is so far from doing harms That he suspects none , on whose foolish honesty My practices ride easy .
If that this simple syllogism will serve , so .
Indeed ?
The age is grown so picked that the toe of the peasant comes so near the heel of the courtier he galls his kibe. , How long hast thou been a grave-maker ?
Lend me a looking-glass .
Thank you .
It is to be all made of sighs and tears , And so am I for Phoebe .
It is not very strange .
The world affords no law to make thee rich .
There is but one mind in all these men , and it is bent against Caesar .
Rosalind lacks then the love Which teacheth thee that thou and I am one .
Call in the messengers sent from the Dauphin .
How do you , Cassio ? , Oh , a chair , a chair !
Then love me , Rosalind .
How now , friend Eros !
Then I beat my tabor , At which , like unbacked colts , they pricked their ears , Advanced their eyelids , lifted up their noses As they smelt music .
Nay , blush not , Cleopatra .
If she confess that she was half the wooer , Destruction on my head if my bad blame Light on the man. , Come hither , gentle mistress .
Hence , Lest that th ' infection of his fortune take Like hold on thee .
Nurse !
How now , you dog ?
I should venture purgatory for 't .
Madam , I had rather , I know your lady does not love her husband .
And O you mortal engines , whose rude throats The immortal Jove's dead clamors counterfeit , Farewell !
My liege , here is a villain and a traitor , that , look your Grace , has struck the glove which your Majesty is take out of the helmet of Alencon .
Didst thou not say he lied ?
I see the ruin of my house .
Into a thousand parts divide one man , And make imaginary puissance .
When beggars die there are no comets seen .
What mean you , madam ?
The last of all the Romans , fare thee well !
The April's in her eyes ; it is love's spring , And these the showers to bring it on .
Come , uncle Exeter , Go you and enter Harfleur .
What ho , Horatio !
But oh , how oddly will it sound that I Must ask my child forgiveness !
Incapable and shallow innocents , You can not guess who caused your father's death .
Know'st thou his mind ?
Now , the next day Was our sea fight , and what to this was sequent Thou know'st already .
Even so .
If only to go warm were gorgeous , Why , nature needs not what thou gorgeous wear'st , Which scarcely keeps thee warm .
Let it be written in eight and eight .
And for my means , I'll husband them so well , They shall go far with little .
What manner of man ?
They are of Norway , sir .
Wondrous heavy .
Sir , he's rash and very sudden in choler , and haply may strike at you .
The pale companion is not for our pomp .
Here comes the man you mean .
Riotous madness , To be entangled with those mouth-made vows Which break themselves in swearing !
We are , my lord , and come to have the warrant That we may be admitted where he is .
Say it , Othello .
Why , is not this better now than groaning for love ?
You have prevailed .
How does Hamlet ?
What is the time o ' th ' day ?
Thy threats have no more strength than her weak prayers. , Helen , I love thee .
And I am your Rosalind .
Signior Hortensio , come you to part the fray ?
He fears , my lord , you mean no good to him .
Well. , Now come , my Ariel !
Romeo !
Look like th ' innocent flower , But be the serpent under 't .
Do what you will , dishonor shall be humor .
Where is the beauteous majesty of Denmark ?
He is a very proper man .
Wisely and slow .
I have already .
Not a whit .
That's a fault that water will mend .
If he be perjured , see you now , his reputation is as arrant a villain and a Jack Sauce as ever his black shoe trod upon God's ground and His earth , in my conscience , la .
Ha , art thou bedlam ?
But there's a saying very old and true : "If that you will France win , Then with Scotland first begin." For once the eagle England being in prey , To her unguarded nest the weasel Scot Comes sneaking and so sucks her princely eggs , Playing the mouse in absence of the cat , To 'tame and havoc more than she can eat .
Relent , and save your souls .
Upon this hint I spake .
No going then !
I pray you , master , tell me ?
Dear Duff , I prithee , contradict thyself , And say it is not so .
What masque , what music ?
Kind gentlemen , your pains Are registered where every day I turn The leaf to read them .
Why , how now , daughter Katherine ?
Sir , by your patience : if I heard you rightly , The duke hath put on a religious life And thrown into neglect the pompous court .
By my troth , he'll yield the crow a pudding one of these days .
My old friend Grumio and my good friend Petruchio ?
Season your admiration for a while With an attent ear , till I may deliver , Upon the witness of these gentlemen , This marvel to you .
There's part of a power already footed .
I am hitherto your daughter .
When thou wakest , if she be by , Beg of her for remedy .
Awake , sir , awake .
Here let them lie Till famine and the ague eat them up .
I came from Corinth , my most gracious lord .
No .
Conceit upon her father .
Tom will throw his head at them. , Avaunt , you curs !
What should I do I do not ?
Let's see these pockets .
Read it instantly .
Tongue , not a word .
Kent , father , sisters !
Will you think so ?
It is no matter .
Amen , amen to that fair prayer , say I .
I am very glad of it .
Hold , or cut bowstrings .
I can not be so partial , Goneril , To the great love I bear you , Pray you , content .
An they be not , let them hang themselves in their own straps .
Is it concluded that he shall be Protector ?
Though Cassio did some little wrong to him , As men in rage strike those that wish them best , Yet surely Cassio , I believe , received From him that fled some strange indignity Which patience could not pass .
Fie on thee !
The violet smells to him as it doth to me .
It is the cry of women , my good lord .
Let me go .
Fellow , I know thee .
There is more in it. , Cousin Ganymede .
Back you shall not to the house , unless you undertake that with me which with as much safety you might answer him .
I would not kill thy unprepared spirit .
He , he , 'tis he .
The captain , Give it the captain .
What wouldst thou now ?
Rosalind is your love's name ?
Oh , I die for food .
Besides , his cote , his flocks , and bounds of feed Are now on sale , and at our sheepcote now , By reason of his absence , there is nothing That you will feed on .
From my house , if I had it , The sixth of July .
Nor I .
Fare you well .
So shines a good deed in a naughty world .
Marry , I'll teach you .
Our enemies have beat us to the pit .
Sunday comes apace .
What sights , my lord ?
This shall determine that .
Marry , well said , very well said .
And you , sir , for this chain arrested me .
A plague upon the tyrant that I serve !
Pray God , he keep his oath !
Since my dear soul was mistress of her choice And could of men distinguish , her election Hath sealed thee for herself , for thou hast been , As one in suffering all that suffers nothing , A man that Fortune's buffets and rewards Hast ta'en with equal thanks .
A drum , a drum !
Nor know I aught By me that's said or done amiss this night , Unless self-charity be sometimes a vice , And to defend ourselves it be a sin When violence assails us .
Did you ever cure any so ?
Think of me as you please .
Too familiar Is my dear son with such sour company .
And in this habit Met I my father with his bleeding rings , Their precious stones new lost , became his guide , Led him , begged for him , saved him from despair .
I am your own for ever .
Thus have you heard me severed from my bliss ; That by misfortunes was my life prolonged To tell sad stories of my own mishaps .
But where tomorrow ?
But , for your conscience ?
thee aloud "England is thine , Ireland is thine , France is thine , and Harry Plantagenet is thine , " who , though I speak it before his face , if he be not fellow with the best king , thou shalt find the best king of good fellows .
Whence are you , sir ?
I am only sorry He had no other death's-man .
But she , your subject , loathes such sovereignty .
Besides , they have burned and carried away all that was in the king's tent , wherefore the king , most worthily , hath caused every soldier to cut his prisoner's throat .
Ay , too gentle .
Why should she write to Edmund ?
If we be not relieved within this hour , We must return to th' court of guard .
Experience , manhood , honor , ne'er before Did violate so itself .
I am no fee'd post , lady .
Marry , for my part , I think the duke hath lost never a man , but one that is like to be executed for robbing a church , one Bardolph , if your Majesty know the man .
Who brought it ?
You must note beside , That we have tried the utmost of our friends , Our legions are brim-full , our cause is ripe .
Call you me daughter ?
I think 'twas Soto that your Honor means .
Some bloody passion shakes your very frame .
Is there any way to show such friendship ?
Your betters , sir .
The queen carouses to thy fortune , Hamlet .
What committed ?
By my troth , Nerissa , my little body is aweary of this great world .
Come , Nerissa. ,
What , Lucius !
What , keep a week away ?
Let him go up into the public chair .
He therefore sends you , meeter for your spirit , This tun of treasure , and , in lieu of this , Desires you let the dukedoms that you claim Hear no more of you .
Thou hast quarreled with a man for coughing in the street because he hath wakened thy dog that hath lain asleep in the sun .
Here's Romeo's man .
Messala , I have here received letters That young Octavius and Mark Antony Come down upon us with a mighty power , Bending their expedition toward Philippi .
This is a devil , and no monster .
I will not budge for no man's pleasure , I .
Maid's mild behavior and sobriety .
Look , where she comes .
Holla !
This is Illyria , lady .
By Isis , I will give thee bloody teeth If thou with Caesar paragon again My man of men .
To me it is a prison .
Ready to go , but never to return .
No , no .
If she deny to wed , I'll crave the day When I shall ask the banns and when be married .
She is a virtuous and a reverend lady .
Though the nature of our quarrel yet never brooked parle , know now upon advice , it toucheth us both , that we may yet again have access to our fair mistress and be happy rivals in Bianca's love , to labor and effect one thing specially .
Thus goes everyone to the world but I , and I am sunburnt .
Do thy office .
I desire you of more acquaintance , good Master Mustardseed .
Have you that I sent you for ?
Why came not the slave back to me when I called him .
The valiant never taste of death but once .
But near him thy angel Becomes afeard , as being o'erpowered .
The gods reward your kindness !
Hence .
Ay , madam .
My niece shall take note of it , and assure thyself , there is no love-broker in the world can more prevail in man's commendation with woman than report of valor .
Fie , sir , fie !
Some good I mean to do Despite of mine own nature .
If thy greatness will Revenge it on him , for I know thou darest , But this thing dare not , That's most certain .
And then , sir , does he this , he does , What was I about to say ?
Hear it not , Duncan , for it is a knell That summons thee to heaven or to hell .
What makes him here ?
Is 't like that lead contains her ?
But what praise couldst thou bestow on a deserving woman indeed , one that in the authority of her merit did justly put on the vouch of very malice itself ?
But i ' faith , I should have been a woman by right .
It shall lose thee nothing .
As the ox hath his bow , sir , the horse his curb , and the falcon her bells , so man hath his desires ; and as pigeons bill , so wedlock would be nibbling .
Give me my robe , for I will go .
Who hath sent thee now ?
Woo't thou fight well ?
That head , my lord ?
Nay , you must name his name , and half his face must be seen through the lion's neck .
I do not know you so good a man as myself .
I see thou know'st me not .
Sir , I have not you by the hand .
You mistake , sir .
There are no tongues else for 's turn .
All there is thine .
O , how we joy to see your wit restored !
Hold , Toby !
Go forth , Agrippa , and begin the fight .
Am I not stayed for ?
So Caesar may .
Hang not on my garments .
A thousand , sir , Early though 't be , have on their riveted trim And at the port expect you .
You must leave this .
What is your tidings ?
Most certain , sir .
Gracious England hath Lent us good Siward and ten thousand men ; An older and a better soldier none That Christendom gives out .
How do you all at Verona ?
This is a very scurvy tune to sing at a man's funeral .
So shall you quietly enjoy your hope And marry sweet Bianca with consent .
Oh , coward that I am , to live so long To see my best friend ta'en before my face !
And I , most jocund , apt , and willingly , To do you rest , a thousand deaths would die .
To tell you true , I counterfeit him .
Sir , I commend you to your own content .
Therefore , patiently and yielding .
But you , sir , altered that , for some hour before you took me from the breach of the sea was my sister drowned .
Let's think 't unsafe To come in to the cry without more help .
My gentleman , Cesario ?
I am in my condition A prince , Miranda , I do think , a king ; I would , not so ! , and would no more endure This wooden slavery than to suffer The flesh-fly blow my mouth .
What should I do with him ?
This , this All Souls ' Day to my fearful soul Is the determined respite of my wrongs .
Fear me not , man .
My lord , you know I love you .
Tranio hits you now .
The gain I seek is quiet in the match .
For mine own good , All causes shall give way .
First , madam , he is well .
And weep ye now , seeing she is advanced Above the clouds , as high as heaven itself ?
But brother Anthony , Come , 'tis no matter .
I tell you , he that can lay hold of her Shall have the chinks .
No better .
I'll fish for thee and get thee wood enough .
What does this mean , my lord ?
As I learned , The night before there was no purpose in them Of this remove .
All eyes !
Comfort me .
I sent you money , sir , to be your bail By Dromio , but I think he brought it not .
They are his shards , and he
Poor men alone ?
Your letters did withhold our breaking forth Till we perceived both how you were wrong led And we in negligent danger .
No .
What , have you writ that letter to my sister ?
I fear me both are false .
Oh , come apace , dispatch !
They'll have me whipped for speaking true , thou'lt have me whipped for lying , and sometimes I am whipped for holding my peace .
Hast thou the pretty worm of Nilus there , That kills and pains not ?
Sir , I lack advancement .
Therefore , I beseech your Highness pardon me .
O most dear mistress , The sun will set before I shall discharge What I must strive to do .
Nay , I hope .
All for your delight We are not here .
I tell you , Captain , if you look in the maps of the 'orld , I warrant you shall find , in the comparisons between Macedon and Monmouth , that the situations , look you , is both alike .
And where's Cordelia ? , Seest thou this object , Kent ?
Yet Edmund was beloved .
At least two glasses .
Do it carefully. , And the noble and true-hearted Kent banished , his offense honesty !
I arrest thee of high treason , by the name of Richard , Earl of Cambridge .
Come , come , thou art as hot a Jack in thy mood as any in Italy , and as soon moved to be moody , and as soon moody to be moved .
The main descry Stands in the hourly thought .
Only to despite them , I will endeavor anything .
Is my master and his wife coming , Grumio ?
His grace looks cheerfully and smooth this morning .
Ay me !
If he fail of that , He will have other means to cut you off .
Be wise , and get you home .
Be thy mouth or black or white , Do-de , de-de .
Haste me to know 't , that I , with wings as swift As meditation or the thoughts of love , May sweep to my revenge .
Didst thou behold Octavia ?
Say I am sick .
Shame itself !
Vouchsafe to those that have not read the story That I may prompt them ; and of such as have , I humbly pray them to admit th ' excuse Of time , of numbers , and due course of things , Which can not in their huge and proper life Be here presented .
Thou hast described A hot friend cooling .
The sky doth frown and lour upon our army .
Ay me !
You make me study of that .
Declare thine office .
This is the very painting of your fear .
I can tell your Majesty , the duke is a prave man .
Helen , it is not so .
By my faith , you have great reason to be sad .
The sun is high , and we outwear the day .
And when I told thee he was of my counsel Of my whole course of wooing , thou cried'st "Indeed ? " And didst contract and purse thy brow together As if thou then hadst shut up in thy brain Some horrible conceit .
Go to your rest .
You'll be sick tomorrow For this night's watching .
Go , Eros , send his treasure after .
No , great king .
Truly , madam , he holds Beelzebub at the staves ' end as well as a man in his case may do .
Wilt thou have me ?
So that in these ten thousand they have lost , There are but sixteen hundred mercenaries .
Well , Petruchio , this has put me in heart .
Neighbors , God speed .
As I discern , It burneth in the Capels ' monument .
Oh , my fortunes have Corrupted honest men !
The king is not to answer it .
Thou worms ' meat in respect of a good piece of flesh , indeed .
I go .
Such news , my lord , as grieves me to report .
In the great hand of God I stand , and thence Against the undivulged pretense I fight Of treasonous malice .
So they are .
Prepare we for our marriage ; on which day , My Lord of Burgundy , we'll take your oath , And all the peers ' , for surety of our leagues .
Adieu .
How now , my lord !
But art thou not drowned , Stephano ?
Good gentle youth , tempt not a desperate man .
You have seen nothing then ?
How are they escoted ?
Seyton ! , I am sick at heart , When I behold , Seyton , I say ! , This push Will cheer me ever , or disseat me now .
Go to , farewell .
Helena , adieu .
Refuse not , mighty lord , this proffered love .
Catesby , fly to the duke .
Here come the officers .
O , let him pass .
She was too good for me .
O heavy deed !
Why , this fellow has banished two on 's daughters , and did the third a blessing against his will .
Tom , away !
Wherefore rejoice ?
Art thou afeard ?
I say he shall go to prison .
I'll bring you to him .
Basting .
If 'twere no other , 'T is but so , I warrant .
If we do meet again , why , we shall smile .
Sir , he dined with her there , at the Porpentine .
The duke my father loved his father dearly .
You rub the sore When you should bring the plaster .
Lie not a night from home .
Space enough Have I in such a prison .
Why , this is not a boon , 'T is as I should entreat you wear your gloves , Or feed on nourishing dishes , or keep you warm , Or sue to you to do a peculiar profit To your own person .
Better I were distract , So should my thoughts be severed from my griefs , And woes by wrong imaginations lose The knowledge of themselves .
Nor would we deign him burial of his men Till he disbursed at Saint Colme's Inch Ten thousand dollars to our general use .
Say , is your tardy master now at hand ?
Marian , I say !
Read .
No wonder , my lord .
I am young , but something You may deserve of him through me , and wisdom To offer up a weak , poor , innocent lamb T ' appease an angry god .
My cousin Westmoreland ?
The wren goes to 't , and the small gilded fly does lecher in my sight .
O villain , thou hast stolen both mine office and my name !
I tell thee , churlish priest , A ministering angel shall my sister be When thou liest howling .
The adventurous knight shall use his foil and target , the lover shall not sigh gratis , the humorous man shall end his part in peace , the clown shall make those laugh whose lungs are tickle o ' th ' sear , and the lady shall say her mind freely , or the blank verse shall halt for 't .
I am the greatest , able to do least , Yet most suspected , as the time and place Doth make against me , of this direful murder .
More pity that the eagle should be mewed While kites and buzzards prey at liberty .
The dearest ring in Venice will I give you , And find it out by proclamation .
This tune goes manly .
Save thee , friend , and thy music .
Will you not tell me who told you so ?
Farewell .
You may as well go about to turn the sun to ice with fanning in his face with a peacock's feather .
I was with Hercules and Cadmus once , When in a wood of Crete they bayed the bear With hounds of Sparta .
Pat , pat .
I must perforce .
Were not you even now with the Countess Olivia ?
Ay .
I had forgot , three months .
Do you question me as an honest man should do , for my simple true judgment ?
And what will you do now ?
Will you be married , motley ?
O noble Caesar !
Speak , man .
I'll go arm myself .
Not a dump , we .
That handkerchief Which I so loved and gave thee , thou gav'st To Cassio .
Thus must I from the smoke into the smother , From tyrant duke unto a tyrant brother .
He never did harm that I heard of .
Are you now going to dispatch this thing ?
By my head , here comes the Capulets .
Thou still hast been the father of good news .
But mark , poor knight , What dreadful dole is here !
Go with me .
I your servant .
What name , fair lady ?
Out of my sight !
Sir , good success .
Yet say I , he is in love .
Mercutio's kinsman , noble County Paris .
Murder , murder !
You have her father's love , Demetrius .
To be Count Malvolio !
In cases of defense 'tis best to weigh The enemy more mighty than he seems .
Why , bride !
Very good , my lord .
Marry , sir , they praise me and make an ass of me , now my foes tell me plainly I am an ass .
Ay , my lord .
Madam , I trust , not so .
Or shall I think in silver she's immured , Being ten times undervalued to tried gold ?
Not he that himself is not so , which is Mark Antony .
Good guard Until their greater pleasures first be known That are to censure them .
Oh !
Why , what you will .
This same should be the voice of Friar John .
I think he will stand very strong with us .
And to that end we wished your Lordship here T ' avoid the censures of the carping world .
O , tell me , Friar , tell me , In what vile part of this anatomy Doth my name lodge ?
Now , my friendly knave , I thank thee .
Poor Tom , thy horn is dry .
I never did deny it .
Belike for want of rain , which I could well Beteem them from the tempest of my eyes .
Good night , good night !
The oats have eaten the horses .
And let those that play your clowns speak no more than is set down for them , for there be of them that will themselves laugh to set on some quantity of barren spectators to laugh too , though in the meantime some necessary question of the play be then to be considered .
Oh , that brave Caesar !
Fie !
Thy life's a miracle .
And never could maintain his part but in the force of his will .
Amen .
He had a kind of taste. , Well , my conscience says , "Launcelot , budge not." "Budge ! " says the fiend .
Therefore the winds , piping to us in vain , As in revenge , have sucked up from the sea Contagious fogs , which falling in the land Have every pelting river made so proud That they have overborne their continents .
I would have sworn it had , my lord , especially against Benedick .
Yare , yare , good Iras , quick .
If I stand here , I saw him .
Hie to your chamber .
Nay , but his jesting spirit , which is now crept into a lute string and now governed by stops , Indeed , that tells a heavy tale for him .
No .
He will not fight with me , Domitius ?
Oh , ten times faster Venus ' pigeons fly To seal love's bonds new made than they are wont To keep obliged faith unforfeited .
What says he of our marriage ?
Come , we'll to sleep .
The one the other poisoned for my sake , And after slew herself .
Very well .
You are almost come to part almost a fray .
I therefore vouch again That with some mixtures powerful o'er the blood Or with some dram , conjured to this effect , He wrought upon her .
Good friend , I prithee , take him in thy arms .
How now , my hearts !
Gallus , go you along .
Good morrow , cousin .
You have forgot the will I told you of .
Therefore let's follow .
What shall we do , Enobarbus ?
I never heard a passion so confused , So strange , outrageous , and so variable , As the dog Jew did utter in the streets .
Hence with your little ones .
Feel you your legs ?
But there where I have garnered up my heart , Where either I must live or bear no life , The fountain from the which my current runs Or else dries up , to be discarded thence !
I meant plain holy thistle .
What traitor hears me and says not "Amen ? " England hath long been mad and scarred herself .
I am the man .
A surgeon !
Madam my interpreter , what says she ?
You have said , sir .
Desire him to go in .
Now , my lord .
I'll get me to a place more void , and there Speak to great Caesar as he comes along .
Where's satisfaction ?
My charms crack not , my spirits obey , and time Goes upright with his carriage .
Scorn and defiance , slight regard , contempt , And anything that may not misbecome The mighty sender , doth he prize you at .
Why , man , what is the matter ?
And therefore haste away , For we must measure twenty miles today .
Even so .
Remember'st thou any that have died on 't ?
On thy life I charge thee , hold !
Let me come to her .
There stays a husband to make you a wife .
Oh , heavy ignorance !
Is it my lady mother ?
Tomorrow , soldier , By sea and land I'll fight .
Why , good sir ?
Therefore I'll sleep again .
I might do 't as well i ' th ' dark .
Cassius , Be not deceived .
Ay , my lord , this same .
Is this a holiday ?
Will you hear me , Roderigo ?
Such duty as the subject owes the prince , Even such a woman oweth to her husband .
Give me my veil .
Mercy , mercy !
Good my lord , give me thy favor still .
Be subject To no sight but thine and mine , invisible To every eyeball else .
I'll have no speaking .
What dost thou mean ?
Oh , now , who will behold The royal captain of this ruined band
Therefore all hearts in love use their own tongues .
Sayest thou so ?

Horn mad , thou villain !
He shall kill two of us , and men indeed , But that's no matter .
My lord , I take my leave .
Dispute it like a man .
The cease of majesty Dies not alone , but , like a gulf , doth draw What's near it with it .
Swear by her foot , that she may tread out the oath .
What should I think on 't ?
Nay , I pray you let me go .
Take their examination yourself and bring it me .
