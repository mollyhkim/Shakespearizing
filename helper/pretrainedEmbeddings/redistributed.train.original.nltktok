Here he comes , and the Scots captain , Captain Jamy , with him .
Oh , Oh , Oh !
But what's your will ?
A pestilent gall to me !
Well , go to .
So rare a wondered father and a wife Makes this place paradise .
Farewell .
You see me , Lord Bassanio , where I stand Such as I am .
You must not deny me .
In my school days , when I had lost one shaft , I shot his fellow of the selfsame flight The selfsame way with more advised watch To find the other forth , and by adventuring both , I oft found both .
Good repose the while !
My fair Bianca , bid my father welcome , While I with selfsame kindness welcome thine .
It is twice blessed : It blesseth him that gives and him that takes .
And an ill singer , my lord .
And yet she'll kneel and pray , I have seen her do 't .
Or as 'twere perfumed by a fen .
He's in Arthur's bosom , if ever man went to Arthur's bosom .
Younger than you Here in Verona , ladies of esteem Are made already mothers .
Antony will use his affection where it is .
Sojourn in Mantua .
Come , come , no longer will I be a fool , To put the finger in the eye and weep Whilst man and master laugh my woes to scorn .
Tis like a demi-cannon .
I assure my good liege , I hold my duty as I hold my soul , Both to my God and to my gracious king .
O , let me not be mad , not mad , sweet heaven !
Welcome , then , Thou unsubstantial air that I embrace !
You are he , you are he .
Now , by Saint George , I am too young for you .
The time is very short .
How much more elder art thou than thy looks !
Ay , good my lord .
Twas this flesh begot Those pelican daughters .
What is yond gentleman ?
All but Metellus Cimber , and he's gone To seek you at your house .
When they are in great danger , I recover them .
Know'st thou not the duke Hath banished me , his daughter ?
What is thy will with her ?
Woo't fast ?
Set down , set down your honorable load , If honor may be shrouded in a hearse , Whilst I awhile obsequiously lament Th ' untimely fall of virtuous Lancaster .
This is the fairy land .
Give him direction for this merry bond , And I will go and purse the ducats straight , See to my house left in the fearful guard Of an unthrifty knave , and presently I will be with you .
Do I look like a cudgel or a hovel-post , a staff or a prop ?
Too old by heaven .
Go put on thy defenses .
The iron tongue of midnight hath told twelve .
A brave vessel Who had , no doubt , some noble creature in her Dashed all to pieces .
I had rather have a fool to make me merry than experience to make me sad , and to travel for it , too .
And now , good friends , As you are friends , scholars and soldiers , Give me one poor request .
Cowards die many times before their deaths .
Give the word , ho , and stand .
So was I when your Highness banished him .
Good Enobarbus , make yourself my guest Whilst you abide here .
Fie , fie , fie , pah , pah ! , Give me an ounce of civet , good apothecary , to sweeten my imagination .
I know him not .
Some officers take them away .
Acquaint her here of my son Paris ' love , And bid her , mark you me , on Wednesday next , But , soft !
What is Pyramus ?
Myself , he , and my sister Today did dine together .
Hark !
Truly , sir , to wear out their shoes to get myself into more work .
Go , Pindarus , get higher on that hill .
Tis she must do 't , And , lo , the happiness !
Have you any further trade with us ?
Thou didst it excellent .
But he that tempered thee bade thee stand up , Gave thee no instance why thou shouldst do treason , Unless to dub thee with the name of traitor .
Banquo and Macbeth , all hail !
He bears him like a portly gentleman , And , to say truth , Verona brags of him To be a virtuous and well-governed youth .
You must needs yield your reason , Sir Andrew .
The sight is dismal , And our affairs from England come too late .
That dreamers often lie .
How lush and lusty the grass looks !
For these fellows of infinite tongue , that can rhyme themselves into ladies ' favors , they do always reason themselves out again .
Well , more anon. , Comes the king forth , I pray you ?
After my death , the one half of my lands , And , in possession , twenty thousand crowns .
Called you , my lord ?
I am a Jew .
I am come To bid my king and master aye good night .
By heaven , I do not , I do not , gentlemen. , O murderous coxcomb !
Set it down .
It's suppertime , my lord .
Thou 'lt be afraid to hear it .
No way but gentleness , gently , gently .
I'll claim that promise at your Grace's hands .
Well , we were born to die .
I would not hear your enemy say so , Nor shall you do mine ear that violence , To make it truster of your own report Against yourself .
I have no way , and therefore want no eyes .
Ah me !
So delicate with her needle , an admirable musician .
Be not afraid , though you do see me weaponed .
Ay , boy .
Shall I know your answer ?
I feel this pinprick .
Nay , good Sir Toby .
So , of his gentleness , Knowing I loved my books , he furnished me From mine own library with volumes that I prize above my dukedom .
We may effect this business yet ere day .
Art of this house ?
He , for his father's sake , so loves the prince That he will not be won to aught against him .
But now I see our lances are but straws , Our strength as weak , our weakness past compare , That seeming to be most which we indeed least are .
Father , in .
Love is merely a madness and , I tell you , deserves as well a dark house and a whip as madmen do , and the reason why they are not so punished and cured is that the lunacy is so ordinary that the whippers are in love , too .
I'll after him , and see the event of this .
Tis time we twain Did show ourselves i' th' field , and to that end Assemble we immediate council .
A howling monster , a drunken monster .
And false .
I pray you call them in .
Such and so finely bolted didst thou seem .
Of love ?
Now welcome , Kate , and bear me witness all That here I kiss her as my sovereign queen .
I shall see thee , ere I die , look pale with love .
The third o' th' world is yours , which with a snaffle You may pace easy , but not such a wife .
I tell you , 'twill sound harshly in her ears .
Zounds , a dog , a rat , a mouse , a cat to scratch a man to death !
In food , in sport , and life-preserving rest To be disturbed , would mad or man or beast .
Which is that adversary ?
Then to the wood will he tomorrow night Pursue her .
Those that will follow Cassius , go with him , And public reasons shall be rendered Of Caesar's death .
This casket threatens .
A third can not be matched unless the devil himself turn Jew .
Wherefore ?
In respect that it is solitary , I like it very well ; but in respect that it is private , it is a very vile life .
Ay , and twenty such .
It is so too .
A madness most discreet , A choking gall , and a preserving sweet .
Never make denial .
What is a traitor ?
If he could right himself with quarreling , Some of us would lie low .
If love have touched you , naught remains but so : Gramercies , lad , go forward .
Kind souls , what , weep you when you but behold Our Caesar's vesture wounded ?
Thither must I , and here I leave you , sir .
By God's sonties , 'twill be a hard way to hit .
Off with that bauble , throw it underfoot .
But note me , signor ,
Tis a subject for a sovereign to reason on , and for a sovereign's sovereign to ride on , and for the world , familiar to us and unknown , to lay apart their particular functions and wonder at him .
Do this suddenly , And let not search and inquisition quail To bring again these foolish runaways .
Come , sirs .
Can you not conceive ?
An they will take it , so .
I neither know it nor can learn of him .
Let all the rest give place .
O villainy !
Sovereign of Egypt , hail !
That's a degree to love .
We are two lions littered in one day , And I the elder and more terrible .
You shall have letters from me to my son In your behalf , to meet you on the way .
Come , Grey .
Not that we love words better , as you do .
I cry you mercy , then , I took you for that cunning whore of Venice That married with Othello. , You , mistress , That have the office opposite to Saint Peter And keep the gate of hell !
If thou beest Trinculo , come forth .
At every house I'll call .
Well , let them rest. , Come hither , Catesby .
I shall not sleep in quiet at the Tower .
Six or seven thousand is their utmost power .
Not a whit , Touchstone .
These are not natural events .
What enterprise , Popillius ?
Good madam , be not angry with the child .
May a man do it ?
No , faith , not a jot .
Iago .
Ay , to me .
What are you ?
Howling attends it .
No watch ?
I have a venturous fairy that shall seek The squirrel's hoard and fetch thee new nuts .
I have it not about me .
I would I could see this taborer .
You are welcome .
But here comes Antony. , Welcome , Mark Antony .
How do you , women ?
Barnardo ?
Let him fly far .
Let the doors be shut upon him , that he may play the fool no where but in 's own house .
Then there is no true lover in the forest , else sighing every minute and groaning every hour would detect the lazy foot of time as well as a clock .
Had she affections and warm youthful blood , She would be as swift in motion as a ball .
Would they had stayed .
Nor for yours neither .
As young as I am , I have observed these three swashers .
Truly , I think they are .
O my poor Rosalind , whither wilt thou go ?
Therefore they thought it good you hear a play And frame your mind to mirth and merriment , Which bars a thousand harms and lengthens life .
Why , you were with him , were you not ?
He forbids it , Being free from vainness and self-glorious pride , Giving full trophy , signal , and ostent Quite from himself , to God .
Let it go all .
Come , begin .
Leave all the rest to me .
Therefore turn and draw .
For I had then laid wormwood to my dug , Sitting in the sun under the dovehouse wall .
Tell him so yourself , And see how he will take it at your hands .
It beckons you to go away with it , As if it some impartment did desire To you alone .
Will you sup there ?
What , drawn , and talk of peace ?
And I have heard Apollodorus carried , What , I pray you ?
O earth , which this blood drink'st revenge his death !
Is in his retirement marvelous distempered .
Let this fellow Be nothing of our strife .
Then , with your will , go on .
My master's .
Nay , faith , let me not play a woman .
The earth sings when he touches it .
Those of his chamber , as it seemed , had done 't .
Why should he not ?
What , no more ceremony ?
My kind Antonio , I can no other answer make but thanks , And thanks , and ever thanks .
Have I caught thee ?
I will hear Cassius and compare their reasons When severally we hear them rendered .
Why , so I did , but looked for no reply .
I pray thee , hear me speak .
Welcome , my lord .
The bridegroom he is come already .
O my good master !
O upright , just , and true-disposing God , How do I thank thee that this carnal cur Preys on the issue of his mother's body And makes her pew-fellow with others ' moan !
Conrade , I say !
Is the sword unswayed ?
Laertes , I must commune with your grief , Or you deny me right .
Methinks I should know you , and know this man .
Alas , poor caitiff !
You shall not gauge me By what we do tonight .
I have great comfort from this fellow .
Go and commend me to my brother Cassius .
Come , tailor , let us see these ornaments .
Fair Leda's daughter had a thousand wooers ; Then well one more may fair Bianca have .
On such a full sea are we now afloat , And we must take the current when it serves Or lose our ventures .
Well , peace be with you , sir .
But was not this nigh shore ?
God bless your Grace with health and happy days .
I'll make so bold to call , For 'tis my limited service .
Your betters have endured me say my mind , And if you can not , best you stop your ears .
I will debate this matter at more leisure And teach your ears to list me with more heed .
The man grows mad .
No marvel , lord , though it affrighted you .
No , no .
What , have you dined at home ?
Good night , Penthesilea .
A good sharp fellow .
Fulvia is dead .
Anything .
Approach thou like the rugged Russian bear , The armed rhinoceros , or th ' Hyrcan tiger ; Take any shape but that , and my firm nerves Shall never tremble .
Was it not yesterday we spoke together ?
Prithee , be not angry .
Why , anything .
You see how easily she may be surprised .
Mistress , Wilt thou still talk ?
My lord , I have news to tell you .
So , Dolabella , It shall content me best .
The rarer action is In virtue than in vengeance .
My hour is almost come When I to sulfurous and tormenting flames Must render up myself .
And shall , sir .
Bless thy five wits .
Good my lord , enter here .
Well shone , Moon ! , Truly , the moon shines with a good grace .
Let it come down .
Sirs , let 't alone .
I have an humor to knock you indifferently well .
Your eyes do menace me .
My lord .
Stand back .
He hath given his empire Up to a whore ; who now are levying The kings o' th' earth for war .
Folded the writ up in form of th ' other , Subscribed it , gave 't th ' impression , placed it safely , The changeling never known .
Ratcliffe , my lord , 'tis I .
You , Nick Bottom , are set down for Pyramus .
Dost thou believe , Orlando , that the boy Can do all this that he hath promised ?
I have heard that Julius Caesar Grew fat with feasting there .
I pray you , one of you question yond man , if he for gold will give us any food .
I knew what you would prove .
Here , kiss the book .
An honest tale speeds best being plainly told .
If we do meet again , we'll smile indeed .
He says , my lord , your daughter is not well .
More than pertains to feats of broils and battle , And therefore little shall I grace my cause In speaking for myself .
My most dear Gloucester !
But jealous souls will not be answered so .
Hortensio , hark .
What will hap more tonight , safe 'scape the king !
It is but change , Titinius , for Octavius Is overthrown by noble Brutus ' power , As Cassius ' legions are by Antony .
No , unpin me here .
Do we so .
When I am known aright you shall not grieve Lending me this acquaintance .
I found it thrown in at the casement of my closet .
Come on , assay .
Let's all sink wi ' th ' king .
Where left we last ?
Good , good , the justice of it pleases !
Come now , what masques , what dances shall we have To wear away this long age of three hours Between our after-supper and bedtime ?
His soldiership Is twice the other twain .
And even now , but now , This house , these servants , and this same myself Are yours , my lord's .
They are then excused , my lord , when they see not what they do .
Tis not the first time you were overshot .
O deadly sin !
Today the lords you talked of are beheaded .
He can not live , I hope , and must not die Till George be packed with post-horse up to heaven .
Let us go sit here upon the church bench till two , and then all to bed .
They know By th' height , the lowness , or the mean , if dearth Or foison follow .
How now , daughter ?
O sir , you are old .
I do not think 't .
I will hear further reason for this .
He is the general challenger .
FOOL Oh , he's drunk , Sir Toby , an hour agone .
Hail , brave friend !
Sin from thy lips ?
It is his hand , my lord , but I hope his heart is not in the contents .
You must away tonight .
Coldhearted toward me ?
Sitting on a bank , Weeping again the king my father's wrack , This music crept by me upon the waters , Allaying both their fury and my passion With its sweet air .
All this" ?
From me he got it .
Here's his dry hand up and down .
I am ready .
Do but look up .
Why do you cross me in this exigent ?
How came these things to pass ?
God , God forgive us all !
You tell us the manner of the wrestling .
I thank thee , Ariel .
I have 't .
Wherefore are these things hid ?
I fear he will prove the weeping philosopher when he grows old , being so full of unmannerly sadness in his youth .
For I have neither wit nor words nor worth , Action nor utterance nor the power of speech , To stir men's blood .
One of them rates All that is won and lost .
Do you hear , Cassio ?
So please your Lordship to accept our duty .
There is your money that I had to keep .
He is as disproportioned in his manners As in his shape. , Take with you your companions .
This morning , like the spirit of a youth That means to be of note , begins betimes .
Why will My lord do so ?
Thank you .
Lips , do not move ; No man must know."
My liege , your highness now may do me good .
I know it by their pale and deadly looks .
Lucentio , gentle sir .
To the health of our general !
Why should the poor be flattered ?
That same cowardly , giantlike ox-beef hath devoured many a gentleman of your house .
Yea , leave that labor to great Hercules , And let it be more than Alcides ' twelve .
The more I love , the more he hateth me .
No , let me not .
But do you hear , sir , have you married my daughter without asking my goodwill ?
Why wither not the leaves that want their sap ?
I could be well moved if I were as you .
I thank it , poor fool , it keeps on the windy side of care .
Now let's have a catch .
Alas , my lord , Your wisdom is consumed in confidence .
What shall you ask of me that I'll deny , That honor , saved , may upon asking give ?
Or , if you do not , make the bridal bed In that dim monument where Tybalt lies .
I have been dear to him , lad , some two thousand strong , or so .
There's some conceit or other likes him well When that he bids good morrow with such spirit .
Here is better than the open air .
Till then , lead thou first .
Why , Am I not i ' th ' right , old Jephthah ?
Put money in thy purse .
If any bark put forth , come to the mart , Where I will walk till thou return to me .
Tis he .
What concern they ?
The fearful passage of their death-marked love And the continuance of their parents ' rage , Which , but their children's end , naught could remove , Is now the two hours ' traffic of our stage , The which , if you with patient ears attend , What here shall miss , our toil shall strive to mend .
In faith , she's too curst .
I pray you mar no more of my verses with reading them ill- favoredly .
What is the opinion of Pythagoras concerning wildfowl ?
Why will you mew her up , Signior Baptista , for this fiend of hell And make her bear the penance of her tongue ?
I'll know his humor when he knows his time .
I must another way To fetch a ladder , by the which your love Must climb a bird's nest soon when it is dark .
The Queen Of audience nor desire shall fail , so she From Egypt drive her all-disgraced friend Or take his life there .
Count the clock .
It is my lady .
To England will I steal , and there I'll steal .
And may you prove , sir , master of your art .
Here comes one .
The old man and his people Can not be well bestowed .
Prithee , no more .
It is the lark that sings so out of tune , Straining harsh discords and unpleasing sharps .
Hark how our steeds for present service neigh .
Now boast thee , Death , in thy possession lies A lass unparalleled .
Look to the queen there , ho !
Give me those flowers .
Where art thou now ?
Who ?
A victory is twice itself when the achiever brings home full numbers .
Why , may one ask ?
Good night , good doctor .
Not a mouse stirring .
For when thou gavest them the rod , and put'st down thine own breeches , Prithee , nuncle , keep a schoolmaster that can teach thy fool to lie .
Make him believe thou art Sir Topas the curate .
This same is she , and I do give you her .
Stay , I prithee , tell me what thou thinkest of me .
You did .
Good thou , save me a piece of marchpane , and , as thou loves me , let the porter let in Susan Grindstone and Nell. , Antony and Potpan !
Why , she defies me Like Turk to Christian .
I kiss his dirty shoe , and from heartstring I love the lovely bully .
He sought my life , But lately , very late .
But where's my fool ?
In my mind's eye , Horatio .
O Iago , the pity of it , Iago !
Yes , by heaven !
My lord , we will not .
Serve you , sir .
Signor Benedick !
At Crosby Place , there shall you find us both .
My lord , whoever journeys to the prince , For God's sake let not us two at home .
Yet let me weep for such a feeling loss .
Muffle me , night , awhile .
Do you perceive in all this noble company Where most you owe obedience ?
True , madam .
He that commends me to mine own content Commends me to the thing I can not get .
I can see a church by daylight .
Set it by a while .
A Roman .
Ay , and Wall too .
Sblood , do you think I am easier to be played on than a pipe ?
For me , I'll not be gone till I please myself .
Yes , by Saint Anne , and ginger shall be hot i ' the mouth too .
No more !
Tis no matter how it be in tune , so it make noise enough .
Alas , how shall this bloody deed be answered ?
If thou hast any sound or use of voice , Speak to me .
Well then , confess and live .
Would you not have me honest ?
Pray you , hasten Your generals after .
And what's the news , good cousin Lodovico ?
And sayst thou yet that exile is not death ?
Did we , my lord ?
My boon I make it that you know me not Till time and I think meet .
Is not that strange ?
Ay , but when ?
Who was it ?
Most like .
So , come , help .
We are arrant knaves , all .
Our size of sorrow , Proportioned to our cause , must be as great As that which makes it .
Half-blooded fellow , yes .
Come let's in all .
Madam , I come to whet your gentle thoughts On his behalf .
What , ho , Brabantio !
Hail to thee , lady , and the grace of heaven , Before , behind thee , and on every hand , Enwheel thee round !
By Cheshu , I think he will plow up all if there is not better directions .
Tranio , I saw her coral lips to move And with her breath she did perfume the air .
I prithee , let thy wife attend on her , And bring them after in the best advantage .
Bear me , good friends , where Cleopatra bides .
Good Grumio , fetch it me .
My cousin tells him in his ear that he is in her heart .
Grieved I I had but one ?
I thank thee , good Sir John , with all my heart .
They shall be apprehended by and by .
Young men's love then lies Not truly in their hearts , but in their eyes .
He had a fever when he was in Spain , And when the fit was on him , I did mark How he did shake .
Ay .
Your worship was wont to tell me that I could do nothing without bidding .
Shall I abide In this dull world , which in thy absence is No better than a sty ?
The phrase would be more germane to the matter if we could carry cannon by our sides .
My tongue and soul in this be hypocrites .
My lord , I do not know that I did cry .
There's comfort yet ; they are assailable .
Fie on thee , wretch .
Leave it to his discretion , and let us listen to the moon .
It did bass my trespass .
Oh , mickle is the powerful grace that lies In herbs , plants , stones , and their true qualities .
I am the second son of old Sir Rowland , That bring these tidings to this fair assembly .
From this time forth I never will speak word .
A halter gratis , nothing else , for God's sake .
Farewell , my dearest sister , fare thee well .
Committed ?
I dare , and do defy thee for a villain .
Well , may you see things well done there .
What is this That rises like the issue of a king , And wears upon his baby-brow the round And top of sovereignty ?
Well , fare you well , my lord .
I will not go today , and ere I do It shall be what o'clock I say it is .
Who is here so base that would be a bondman ?
Why , sweet Othello , I have not deserved this .
So thou mayst say the king lies by a beggar if a beggar dwell near him , or the church stands by thy tabor , if thy tabor stand by the church .
Montjoy .
It waves me forth again .
I'll show thee the best springs .
But repetition of what thou hast marred .
Here , my lord .
The town will rise .
The venom of such looks , we fairly hope , Have lost their quality , and that this day Shall change all griefs and quarrels into love .
You have been factious one against the other. , Wife , love Lord Hastings .
No , I pray thee speak in sober judgment .
Good .
Did he never make you laugh ?
What does he say of Brutus ?
I remember a mass of things , but nothing distinctly .
I am not of your element .
And neigh , and bark , and grunt , and roar , and burn , Like horse , hound , hog , bear , fire , at every turn .
No , if without more words you will get you hence .
But you , my honorable lords , may name the time , And in the duke's behalf I'll give my voice , Which I presume he'll take in gentle part .
How now , how now ?
Where should she be ?
Metellus Cimber ?
And am I then revenged
All this is comfort .
Swear by my sword .
Good night , good Captain Blunt .
Therefore you must needs play Pyramus .
My heart is sorry for your daughter's death , But , on my honor , she was charged with nothing But what was true and very full of proof .
She gives it out that you shall marry her .
Dost thou lie still ?
Tell me , if your art Can tell so much : shall Banquo's issue ever Reign in this kingdom ?
She did commend my yellow stockings of late , she did praise my leg being cross-gartered , and in this she manifests herself to my love , and with a kind of injunction , drives me to these habits of her liking .
I'll bring you thither , my lord , if you'll vouchsafe me .
Oh , it offends me to the soul to hear a robustious periwig-pated fellow tear a passion to tatters , to very rags , to split the ears of the groundlings , who for the most part are capable of nothing but inexplicable dumb-shows and noise .
Do as I bid thee .
Is it possible A cur can lend three thousand ducats ? " Or Shall I bend low and in a bondman's key With bated breath and whispering humbleness Say this :
Soldier , you must come to the king .
The mighty gods defend thee !
With duty and desire we follow you .
I dare abide no longer .
Then , good my lord , teach your cousin to consent winking .
Away !
But , by your favor , how near's the other army ?
Of what your reverence shall incite us to .
You told me you salute not at the court but you kiss your hands .
Come , sire , no more. , What , Oswald , ho !
He is enamored on Hero .
And now to our French causes .
Alas , poor rogue , I think indeed she loves me .
Sometime I'd divide , And burn in many places .
They'll be in scarlet straight at any news .
Here she comes , cursed and sad .
Besides , the king's name is a tower of strength Which they upon the adverse party want .
How say you to that , Malvolio ?
If it pass against us , We lose the better half of our possession , For all the temporal lands which men devout By testament have given to the Church Would they strip from us , being valued thus : "As much as would maintain , to the King's honor , Full fifteen earls and fifteen hundred knights , Six thousand and two hundred good esquires ; And , to relief of lazars and weak age Of indigent faint souls past corporal toil , A hundred almshouses right well supplied ; And to the coffers of the King besides , A thousand pounds by th ' year." Thus runs the bill .
What's the matter , lieutenant ?
I give away myself for you and dote upon the exchange .
My fault , but not my body , pardon , sovereign .
Her vine , the merry cheerer of the heart , Unpruned , dies .
Pray you lead on .
What mean'st thou by that ?
Come , away !
If every one knows us , and we know none , 'T is time , I think , to trudge , pack , and be gone .
Pray you , away .
One minded like the weather , most unquietly .

Oh , strange !
If our eyes had authority , here they might take two thieves kissing .
I pray you , sir , take patience .
A guiltless death I die .
I will not swear these are my hands .
And what of all this ?
Good Lord for alliance !
Poor painted queen , vain flourish of my fortune , Why strew'st thou sugar on that bottled spider , Whose deadly web ensnareth thee about ?
Confusion now hath made his masterpiece .
True , my good boy. , Come , bring us to this hovel .
O sweet bully Bottom !
Sweet Sir Andrew !
Note him , Note him , good Charmian , 'tis the man , but note him .
Why , God will send more , if the man will be thankful .
I am given , sir , secretly to understand that your younger brother Orlando hath a disposition to come in disguised against me to try a fall .
Oh , you are sick of self-love , Malvolio , and taste with a distempered appetite .
I long to hear him call the drunkard "husband , " And how my men will stay themselves from laughter When they do homage to this simple peasant .
That will I do .
Let your wedding be tomorrow .
Tis but thy name that is my enemy .
But oh , poor Gloucester , Lost he his other eye ?
Yes , something you can deny for your own safety : you have been a great thief by sea .
Let her live To join our kingdoms and our hearts , and never Fly off our loves again !
Cursed be thy stones for thus deceiving me !
Hear me , good friends ,
I thank it .
He doth indeed show some sparks that are like wit .
Tedious it were to tell and harsh to hear .
If , sir , perchance She have restrained the riots of your followers , 'T is on such ground and to such wholesome end As clears her from all blame .
If you be gentlemen , Do me this right : hear me with patience .
Take thrice thy money .
Moneys is your suit .
I can stay with Regan , I and my hundred knights .
And look , where Publius is come to fetch me .
Romans , countrymen , and lovers !
That most ingrateful boy there by your side From the rude sea's enraged and foamy mouth Did I redeem .
Here comes the fool , i ' faith .
He faints ! , My lord , my lord !
Give me your hand first .
I say to you this house is dark .
Therefore I have entreated him along With us to watch the minutes of this night , That if again this apparition come He may approve our eyes and speak to it .
I saw the Duchess of Milan's gown that they praise so .
Ay , by my life , And never did desire to see thee more .
Where is the foolish knave I sent before ?
By Dromio ?
Throw some of them at me .
But have you both forsworn me ?
Oh , are you come , Iago ?
Excellent good , i ' faith .
Trow you whither I am going ?
But stop my house's ears , I mean my casements , Let not the sound of shallow foppery enter My sober house .
What now , Lucillius ?
And so say I .
Tyrants themselves wept when it was reported .
For God's sake , take a house .
Go thy ways to a nunnery .
Come hither , Nurse .
The crowner hath sat on her and finds it Christian burial .
Her dotage now I do begin to pity .
So will you wish on me when the rash mood is on .
But is there no sequel at the heels of this mother's admiration ?
Peace. , Who comes here ?
There's none but witches do inhabit here , And therefore 'tis high time that I were hence .
Things that are past are done , with me .
Quoth my master .
When we our betters see bearing our woes , We scarcely think our miseries our foes .
And in their ship I am sure Lorenzo is not .
What , dead , my dove ?
That may be , sir , when I may be a wife .
I hear The strain of strutting chanticleer Cry "Cock-a-diddle-dow." Where should this music be ?
It was ourself thou didst abuse .
More shall they speak , for now I am bent to know , By the worst means , the worst .
For them all together , which maintained so politic a state of evil that they will not admit any good part to intermingle with them .
When that the poor have cried , Caesar hath wept .
O Cassius , Brutus gave the word too early , Who , having some advantage on Octavius , Took it too eagerly .
Let me love him for that , and do you love him because I do .
What should it be that is so shrieked abroad ?
Is not their climate foggy , raw , and dull , On whom , as in despite , the sun looks pale , Killing their fruit with frowns ?
Why , friends , you go to do you know not what .
Give her the right you should have given her cousin , And so dies my revenge .
There's magic in the web of it .
Methinks I see my cousin's ghost Seeking out Romeo , that did spit his body Upon a rapier's point .
Nay , certainly , I have heard the Ptolemies' pyramises are very goodly things .
Right true it is your son Lucentio here Doth love my daughter and she loveth him , Or both dissemble deeply their affections .
I was the man i ' the moon when time was .
I am sorry I beat thee .
Done to death by slanderous tongues Was the Hero that here lies .
Well , come again tomorrow .
Nor have I seen More that I may call men than you , good friend , And my dear father .
Art thou thus boldened , man , by thy distress Or else a rude despiser of good manners , That in civility thou seem'st so empty ?
It were a tedious difficulty , I think , To bring them to that prospect .
Farewell , farewell .
Run after that same peevish messenger , The county's man .
The star is fall'n .
Gave it a judge's clerk !
You had musty victual , and he hath holp to eat it .
Tut , I like it not .
No , sir .
Know you what Caesar means to do with me ?
What will you do ?
Those that are married already , all but one , shall live .
You are idle , shallow things .
I'll call upon you ere you go to bed And tell you what I know .
Wife !
They follow the king's pleasure .
I am a spirit of no common rate .
The enemy comes on in gallant show .
Swagger ?
Gracious Olivia , What do you say , Cesario ? , Good my lord , My lord would speak .
May I be bold To think these spirits ?
There is none but he Whose being I do fear , and under him My genius is rebuked , as it is said Mark Antony's was by Caesar .
I am bound to hear .
Why , no .
They'll kill us .
Nor I know not Where I did lodge last night .
Within a month , Ere yet the salt of most unrighteous tears Had left the flushing in her galled eyes , She married .
Alack the day , I know you not , young gentleman .
What , so brief ?
Nay , good my lord , this courtesy is not of the right breed .
It was in place where I could not breed no contention with him , but I will be so bold as to wear it in my cap till I see him once again , and then I will tell him a little piece of my desires .
A friendly eye could never see such faults .
Where do I dwell ?
Tyrrel , I mean those bastards in the Tower .
Norfolk , we must have knocks , ha , must we not ?
Tis time that I were gone .
I will compound this strife .
With him is Gratiano gone along .
And private in his chamber pens himself , Shuts up his windows , locks fair daylight out , And makes himself an artificial night .
Grim-visaged war hath smoothed his wrinkled front ; And now , instead of mounting barbed steeds To fright the souls of fearful adversaries , He capers nimbly in a lady's chamber To the lascivious pleasing of a lute .
I'll seal to such a bond , And say there is much kindness in the Jew .
I loved you not .
O limed soul that , struggling to be free , Art more engaged !
Most certain .
Poor bird !
Look , how she rubs her hands .
Herald , save thou thy labor .
Why , at her father's .
If he have never drunk wine afore , it will go near to remove his fit .
Then both , or one , or anything thou wilt .
My cousin means Signor Benedick of Padua .
Stephano is my name , and I bring word My mistress will before the break of day Be here at Belmont .
How say you , sir ?
Mad for thy love ?
Oh , she is lame !
I will verify as much in his beard .
But I will write again to Mantua , And keep her at my cell till Romeo come .
Sit , sir .
I spoke with his man .
Your Honor wins bad humors .
And now they do re-stem Their backward course , bearing with frank appearance Their purposes toward Cyprus .
Within the infant rind of this small flower Poison hath residence and medicine power .
None but the fool , who labors to outjest His heart-struck injuries .
With lawyers in the vacation , for they sleep between term and term , and then they perceive not how time moves .
I pray you , tell my lord and father , madam , I will not marry yet .
By my troth , the fool has an excellent breast .
O my daughter , Fled with a Christian !
All-seeing heaven , what a world is this !
If th ' other two be brained like us , the state totters .
What would you ?
Edmund is dead , my lord .
And the queen too , and that presently .
Farewell .
I will be proud , I will read politic authors , I will baffle Sir Toby , I will wash off gross acquaintance , I will be point- devise the very man .
What claim lays she to thee ?
That island of England breeds very valiant creatures .
This is called "the countercheck quarrelsome , " and so to "the lie circumstantial" and "the lie direct." And how oft did you say his beard was not well cut ?
He does hear me , And that he does I weep .
Zounds , hold your peace .
O Cassio , Cassio , Cassio !
From helmet to the spur , all blood he was .
I found him here as melancholy as a lodge in a warren .
When it concerns the fool or coward .
Most excellent accomplished lady , the heavens rain odors on you !
Then 'tis like the breath of an unfee'd lawyer .
You're fall'n into a princely hand .
But soft you , let me be .
Tis a worthy governor .
Much good do you , scald knave , heartily .
Is it come to this ?
What's to be done ?
She bids you come to her .
You are both sure , and will assist me ?
How sweet is love itself possessed When but love's shadows are so rich in joy !
But why should honor outlive honesty ?
Be patient , gentlemen .
Hold , sir , or I'll throw your dagger o'er the house .
So farewell to you both .
He married but his occasion here .
Good madonna , give me leave to prove you a fool .
The time was once when thou unurged wouldst vow That never words were music to thine ear , That never object pleasing in thine eye , That never touch well welcome to thy hand , That never meat sweet-savored in thy taste , Unless I spake , or looked , or touched , or carved to thee .
Had you not been their father , these white flakes Did challenge pity of them .
I have heard Where many of the best respect in Rome , Except immortal Caesar , speaking of Brutus And groaning underneath this age's yoke , Have wished that noble Brutus had his eyes .
I could find in my heart to beat him , But that the poor monster's in drink .
I shall be there before thee .
Go , coward as thou art .
Five summers have I spent in farthest Greece , Roaming clean through the bounds of Asia , And , coasting homeward , came to Ephesus , Hopeless to find , yet loath to leave unsought Or that or any place that harbors men .
That will I , Pompey .
I am not merry , but I do beguile The thing I am by seeming otherwise .
Give every man thy ear but few thy voice .
A solemn air and the best comforter To an unsettled fancy cure thy brains , Now useless , boiled within thy skull. , There stand , For you are spell-stopped. , Mine eyes , ev'n sociable to the show of thine , Fall fellowly drops .
I'll make you amends next , to give you nothing for something .
You jig and amble , and you lisp , you nickname God's creatures and make your wantonness your ignorance .
The red plague rid you For learning me your language !
Well , sir , get you in .
Madam , he's well .
Then do but say to me what I should do That in your knowledge may by me be done , And I am pressed unto it .
Even then this forked plague is fated to us When we do quicken .
If any such there be , heaven pardon him !
Is there no offense in 't ?
I know , sir , I am no flatterer .
Authority .
Call her forth to me .
Happier than this , She is not bred so dull but she can learn .
I am one , my liege , Whom the vile blows and buffets of the world Have so incensed that I am reckless what I do to spite the world .
He is .
O Hamlet , what a falling off was there !
Till then sit still , my soul .
Good morrow , masters .
If you deny them , all the land will rue it .
Come , let us sup betimes , that afterwards We may digest our complots in some form .
Madam , I heard her speak .
Anon !
Thou speak'st aright .
Eyes , look your last .
But are you sure That Benedick loves Beatrice so entirely ?
Our duties , and the pledge .
O happy dagger , This is thy sheath .
Answer as I call you. , Nick Bottom , the weaver ?
Well , let it strike .
Good sister , wrong me not nor wrong yourself , To make a bondmaid and a slave of me .
Oh , then , I see Queen Mab hath been with you .
Good faith , a little one , not past a pint , As I am a soldier .
Marry , I will , and this is wisely done .
Here's one , a friend , and one that knows you well .
A thousand thanks , Signior Gremio .
This quarry cries on havoc .
How is 't with you ?
Past all expressing .
I hold your dainties cheap , sir , and your welcome dear .
And yet I wish but for the thing I have .
Looked he or red or pale , or sad or merrily ?
The king , sir , hath wagered with him six Barbary horses , against the which he has impawned , as I take it , six French rapiers and poniards with their assigns , as girdle , hangers , and so .
Indeed ?
Who hath made this havoc with them ?
This falls out better than I could devise .
The beds i' th' East are soft , and thanks to you , That called me timelier than my purpose hither , For I have gained by 't .
Thou sing'st sweet music .
Awake !
Then must the Jew be merciful .
Witness you That he is borne about invisible .
An you lie , sirrah , we'll have you whipped .
If you will take a homely man's advice , Be not found here .
This a good block .
O serpent heart hid with a flowering face !
We think not so , my lord .
She's not well married that lives married long , But she's best married that dies married young .
Draw the curtains , so , so , so .
Oh , how he loves Caesar !
Nay , 'tis most certain , Iras .
Know'st thou not any whom corrupting gold Will tempt unto a close exploit of death ?
Can heaven be so envious ?
Untimely storms make men expect a dearth .
Answer my life my judgment , Thy youngest daughter does not love thee least , Nor are those empty-hearted whose low sound Reverbs no hollowness .
I would the fool were married to her grave !
Come , draw the curtain , Nerissa .
Therefore give out you are of Epidamnum , Lest that your goods too soon be confiscate .
Be not afraid of greatness." 'T was well writ .
Say , my spirit , How fares the king and 's followers ?
I think it is in Macedon where Alexander is porn .
But while thou livest , keep a good tongue in thy head .
Ay , indeed !
Be 't as our gods will have 't .
Have you done yet ?
By my troth , I am sick .
Some that will evermore peep through their eyes And laugh like parrots at a bagpiper , And other of such vinegar aspect That they'll not show their teeth in way of smile Though Nestor swear the jest be laughable .
And all my children ?
O , what more favor can I do to thee , Than with that hand that cut thy youth in twain To sunder his that was thine enemy ?
Would you were not sick !
No occupation .
Think'st thou that duty shall have dread to speak When power to flattery bows ?
Thou teachest me .
I will bandy with thee in faction .
A good lenten answer .
Seek him , bid him come hither .
Know you not , master , to some kind of men Their graces serve them but as enemies ?
What should he be ?
Up .
What horrible fancy's this ?
Since that my beauty can not please his eye , I'll weep what's left away , and weeping die .
And is it thus ?
Go back again , thou slave , and fetch him home .
Let me alone .
Why , what a monstrous fellow art thou , thus to rail on one that is neither known of thee nor knows thee !
Demand .
How now ?
He is descried .
When was it she last walked ?
Tarry , rash wanton .
Apollo plays , And twenty caged nightingales do sing : Or wilt thou sleep ?
Do as I bid thee , go .
My heart is thirsty for that noble pledge .
He can not be heard of .
If he be taken , he shall never more Be feared of doing harm .
What Adam dost thou mean ?
O , you are novices !
I shall the effect of this good lesson keep As watchman to my heart .
As hell , Sir Topas .
What say you ?
So frowned he once when , in an angry parle , He smote the sledded Polacks on the ice .
Would 't had been done !
Very ill , too .
Tis thus : Who tells me true , though in his tale lie death , I hear him as he flattered .
O monstrous world !
Murder most foul , as in the best it is .
No , monster , not I .
I could interpret between you and your love , if I could see the puppets dallying .
Is it honest in deed and word ?
Myself ?
All is confirmed , my lord , which was reported .
It may be , these apparent prodigies , The unaccustomed terror of this night , And the persuasion of his augurers May hold him from the Capitol today .
Why do you speak so startingly and rash ?
Will you to Scone ?
Prithee bear some charity to my wit .
The concernancy , sir ?
Ay , if a woman live to be a man .
Clarence still breathes ; Edward still lives and reigns .
In sadness , cousin , I do love a woman .
May she give that ?
It seldom visits sorrow .
I'll make him find him .
Last night she slept not , nor tonight she shall not .
I will look further into 't .
My lady has a white hand , and the Myrmidons are no bottle-ale houses .
You'll find it otherwise , I assure you .
I shall do 't .
My master is the great rich Capulet , and if you be not of the house of Montagues , I pray come and crush a cup of wine .
I know you .
Then let them use us well , else let them know , The ills we do , their ills instruct us so .
I , sir , am Dromio .
If this be so , why blame you me to love you ?
Thou art in a parlous state , shepherd .
Here .
He brings great news .
What wouldst thou have with me ?
Thou shalt Go back , I warrant thee !
Now die , die , die , die , die .
She that would be your wife now ran from you .
Is Cassius near ?
Call my train together. , Degenerate bastard , I'll not trouble thee .
Some villain hath done me wrong .
No , my lord .
But in respect of that , I would fain think it were not .
Let him write down the Prince's officer "coxcomb." Come , bind them. , Thou naughty varlet !
Even for the blood That then I lost for thee , now grant me justice .
Being done unknown , I should have found it afterwards well done , But must condemn it now .
Abate the edge of traitors , gracious Lord , That would reduce these bloody days again , And make poor England weep in streams of blood !
Urchins Shall , forth at vast of night that they may work , All exercise on thee .
Haste thee for thy life .
If there be any good thing to be done That may to thee do ease and grace to me , Speak to me .
Yea , marry , dost thou hear , Balthasar ?
A bitter fool .
My wits begin to turn. , Come on , my boy .
I will make your peace with him if I can .
No man must know." If this should be thee , Malvolio ?
And when she is froward , peevish , sullen , sour , And not obedient to his honest will , What is she but a foul contending rebel And graceless traitor to her loving lord ?
It must be your imagination then , and not theirs .
So did I too , and he swore he would marry her tonight .
You do remember all the circumstance ?
No masque tonight .
And her sister By her is poisoned .
This you should pity rather than despise .
What's he That was not born of woman ?
This a dull sight .
The foul'st best fits My latter part of life .
Thy Clarence he is dead that stabbed my Edward , And the beholders of this frantic play , Th ' adulterate Hastings , Rivers , Vaughan , Grey , Untimely smothered in their dusky graves .
Run hence , proclaim , cry it about the streets .
A traveler .
A pox o ' your bottle !
The cause is in my will .
O , let me kiss that hand !
I am to blame to be thus waited for .
What , to perverseness ?
I had rather be a toad And live upon the vapor of a dungeon Than keep a corner in the thing I love For others ' uses .
Look what I speak , or do , or think to do , You are still crossing it .
See it done And feast the army .
Assuredly the thing is to be sold .
So the gods keep you And make the hearts of Romans serve your ends .
Nor I .
Ay , gentle cousin , were it light enough .
Do you know me , my lord ?
Help me into some house , Benvolio , Or I shall faint .
Find thou the means , and I'll find such a man .
I pray you , jest , sir , as you sit at dinner .
What think'st thou ?
Are you crept hither to see the wrestling ?
Fie , Demetrius !
Who must hang them ?
But I do think it is their husbands ' faults If wives do fall .
Caesar , I never stood on ceremonies , Yet now they fright me .
Hast thou not dropped from heaven ?
To whose hands You have sent the lunatic king .
And yours of Helena to me bequeath , Whom I do love and will do till my death .
O , the kindest Kate !
My mistress , sir , " quoth I .
For the love of God , a surgeon !
O insupportable and touching loss !
Therefore be merry , Cassio , For thy solicitor shall rather die Than give thy cause away .
He's dead and rotten .
and but I be deceived , Signior Baptista may remember me , Near twenty years ago , in Genoa , Where we were lodgers at the Pegasus .
Belike some noble gentleman that means , Traveling some journey , to repose him here .
I do repent me that I put it to you .
I know this is a joyful trouble to you , But yet 'tis one .
Why , I am sorry for thee , gentle Silvius .
I pray you , know me when we meet again .
His grace hath made the match , and all grace say "Amen" to it .
And what art thou , thou idol ceremony ?
Such unconstant starts are we like to have from him as this of Kent's banishment .
What's the matter ?
Tom's a- cold .
What means your grace ?
And so farewell , Signior Lucentio .
Our dinner done and he not coming thither , I went to seek him .
Oh , is that all ?
The sun doth gild our armor .
Yonder sure they are coming .
Good faith , and when I met this holy man , The men you talk of came into my mind .
Ay , lord .
We must to the watch .
Both our remedies Within thy help and holy physic lies .
When I wore it at your daughter's marriage ?
Thine eyes , sweet lady , have infected mine .
Tis much. , Servants , leave me and her alone .
The fee simple ?
Was that done like Cassius ?
But he protests he loves you And needs no other suitor but his likings To take the safest occasion by the front To bring you in again .
Warm , o ' my troth .
It should be , But he is drowned , and these are devils .
Give mine the benefit of seigniory , And let my griefs frown on the upper hand .
You must play Pyramus. , And Flute , you Thisbe .
I was hurt under your arm .
Tis strange , my Theseus , that these lovers speak of .
Macbeth Is ripe for shaking , and the powers above Put on their instruments .
Ah , cut my lace asunder , That my pent heart may have some scope to beat , Or else I swoon with this dead-killing news !
I loved Ophelia .
The sweeter rest was mine .
She is not well .
Master , shall I be porter at the gate ?
But I will wed thee in another key , With pomp , with triumph , and with reveling .
I'll do the service of a younger man In all your business and necessities .
I know the good king and queen have sent for you .
Well , here's my comfort .
You are a saucy boy .
I wonder at it .
Fare thee well .
The Moor hath killed my mistress !
What , dost thou make us minstrels ?
Did he take interest ?
A sovereign shame so elbows him .
Many a man would take you at your word And go indeed , having so good a mean .
Come hither , you rogue !
Very good !
We hope to make the sender blush at it .
In this , though I can not be said to be a flattering honest man , it must not be denied but I am a plain-dealing villain .
We had much more monstrous matter of feast , which worthily deserved noting .
My good friends , hark !
He shall in time be ready .
Pray you , avoid it .
But I can tell you that of late this duke Hath ta'en displeasure 'gainst his gentle niece , Grounded upon no other argument But that the people praise her for her virtues And pity her for her good father's sake ; And , on my life , his malice 'gainst the lady Will suddenly break forth .
Tis now struck twelve .
Do you know me , Father ?
Have by some surgeon , Shylock , on your charge , To stop his wounds lest he do bleed to death .
To horse , you gallant princes , straight to horse .
But who was this ?
My royal cousin , teach you our princess English ?
Was ever match clapped up so suddenly ?
This was looked for at your hand , and this was balked .
Art thou a churchman ?
Oh weary reckoning !
You sulfurous and thought-executing fires , Vaunt-couriers of oak-cleaving thunderbolts , Singe my white head !
Dolabella !
He is drowned Whom thus we stray to find , and the sea mocks Our frustrate search on land .
What , thou meanest an officer ?
Well , say , sir .
Let's see .
Know of your youth .
Who's there ?
I can no more .
No cause , no cause .
Thou canst tell why one's nose stands i ' th ' middle on 's face ?
Did this in Caesar seem ambitious ?
For my part , I have walked about the streets , Submitting me unto the perilous night , And , thus unbraced , Casca , as you see , Have bared my bosom to the thunder-stone .
What says that fool of Hagar's offspring , ha ?
Didst thou not hear their shouts ?
The more fool you for laying on my duty .
Why then , to thee , thou silver treasure house .
We must die , Messala .
I know you could not lack , I am certain on 't , Very necessity of this thought , that I , Your partner in the cause 'gainst which he fought , Could not with graceful eyes attend those wars Which fronted mine own peace .
So all .
Sir , the gods Will have it thus .
Ay , a thousand times. , Peter !
Dost thou say so ?
If not to answer , you might haply think Tongue-tied ambition , not replying , yielded To bear the golden yoke of sovereignty , Which fondly you would here impose on me .
I think so , Charmian .
What , are you mad ?
Will your grace command me any service to the world's end ?
Prithee , my king , be quiet .
No ?
Such wind as scatters young men through the world To seek their fortunes farther than at home , Where small experience grows .
This I made good to you In our last conference , passed in probation with you , How you were borne in hand , how crossed , the instruments , Who wrought with them , and all things else that might To half a soul and to a notion crazed Say , "Thus did Banquo." You made it known to us .
Faith , no , as you may season it in the charge .
But how did you desire it should be made ?
Yet words do well When he that speaks them pleases those that hear .
Meantime I writ to Romeo , That he should hither come as this dire night , To help to take her from her borrowed grave , Being the time the potion's force should cease .
Heaven truly knows that thou art false as hell .
Go to , you're a dry fool .
Arise , dissembler .
Your father got excellent husbands , if a maid could come by them .
I have charged thee not to haunt about my doors .
Not mad , but bound more than a madman is , Shut up in prison , kept without my food , Whipped and tormented and , Good e'en , good fellow .
By Jove , I am not covetous for gold Nor care I who doth feed upon my cost ; It yearns me not if men my garments wear ; Such outward things dwell not in my desires .
O , do not swear , my lord of Buckingham !
I'll tell thee ere thou ask it me again .
As it determines , so Dissolve my life !
An oath of mickle might , and fury shall abate .
The drink , the drink !
I , gentle mistress .
Lysander , keep thy Hermia .
Some of my shame , if you will know of me What man I am , and how , and why , and where This handkercher was stained .
Yes , he is dead .
I can not think it .
The goodness of the night upon you , friends !
I will be here again , even with a thought .
Go to , then .
Dost fall ?
Whip him .
He's speaking now , Or murmuring "Where's my serpent of old Nile ? " For so he calls me .
No such jade as you , if me you mean .
The near in blood , The nearer bloody .
Now , by the holy mother of our Lord , The citizens are mum , say not a word .
By two o'clock I will be with thee again .
Rescue , fair lord , or else the day is lost !
Three words , dear Romeo , and good night indeed .
I do attend here on the general And think it no addition , nor my wish , To have him see me womaned .
Is it not strange , Canidius , That from Tarentum and Brundusium He could so quickly cut the Ionian sea And take in Toryne ? , You have heard on 't , sweet ?

Ay , but not enough .
Good night .
No more , cousin .
You shall not choose but drink before you go .
The English power is near , led on by Malcolm , His uncle Siward and the good Macduff .

My countryman , but yet I know him not .
Is 't not well done ?
Your plainness and your shortness please me well .
Fortune , that arrant whore , Ne'er turns the key to th ' poor .
When shall he come ?

As thou got'st Milan , I'll come by Naples .
Men at some time are masters of their fates .
Stanley , what news with you ?
What is Thisbe ?

Here , sweet lord , at your service .
But if he be at hand I shall be satisfied .
A dear happiness to women .
The earl of Pembroke keeps his regiment , Good Captain Blunt , bear my goodnight to him , And by the second hour in the morning Desire the earl to see me in my tent .
Nay , an you be so tardy , come no more in my sight .
I pray you , Let not my jealousies be your dishonors , But mine own safeties .
Come , come .
But I , who never knew how to entreat , Nor never needed that I should entreat , Am starved for meat , giddy for lack of sleep , With oaths kept waking and with brawling fed .

Throw physic to the dogs ; I'll none of it .
Had he a hand to write this , a heart and brain to breed it in ?
Not now .
Make all the money thou canst .
Keep thou the left .
I do not think it good .
He hath known you but three days , and already you are no stranger .
At a word , I am not .
We love him highly And shall continue our graces towards him .
Bear free and patient thoughts .
Your reason ?
I'll lay fourteen of my teeth , and yet , to my teen be it spoken , I have but four , she is not fourteen .
We first address towards you , who with this king Hath rivaled for our daughter .
Shylock is my name .
That .
And when shalt thou see him again ?
I'll join with black despair against my soul And to myself become an enemy .
What is this castle called that stands hard by ?
Done .
What though I killed her husband and her father ?
Why , how now , Adam ?
Pardon not that .
I shall do my friends no wrong , for I have none to lament me ; the world no injury , for in it I have nothing .
Found you no displeasure in him by word or countenance ?
Nay , very pale .
I speak to thee plain soldier .
Come , father , I'll bestow you with a friend .
Why , for that too .
I have forsworn his bed and company .
Well then , now Have you considered of my speeches ?
What need you five and twenty , ten , or five To follow in a house where twice so many Have a command to tend you ?
Ay , marry , what is he ?
Oh , that's well said , the chair !
O , farewell , honest soldier .
First resolve me that .
No , coz , I rather weep .
Soft and fair , Friar. , Which is Beatrice ?
No , sir , 'tis in grain ; Noah's flood could not do it .
To him will I .
By my holy order , I thought thy disposition better tempered .
The limit of your lives is out .
Give me some music .
I had rather have this tongue cut from my mouth Than it should do offence to Michael Cassio .
Tyranny is dead !
I know thee well .
How now ?
Bid me farewell .
I have forgot why I did call thee back .
Then are our beggars bodies , and our monarchs and outstretched heroes the beggars ' shadows .

His letter there Will show you his estate .
Spoke like an officer !
Yet Caesar shall go forth , for these predictions Are to the world in general as to Caesar .
I charge you , go with me .
But by and by comes back to Romeo , Who had but newly entertained revenge , And to 't they go like lightning , for ere I Could draw to part them was stout Tybalt slain .
When last I was at Exeter , The mayor in courtesy showed me the castle And called it Rougemont , at which name I started , Because a bard of Ireland told me once I should not live long after I saw Richmond .
Wilt break my heart ?
Proceed , Solinus , to procure my fall , And by the doom of death end woes and all .
And so farewell. , Katherina , you may stay , For I have more to commune with Bianca .
Avoid what is to come .
Say 'tis not so , a province I will give thee And make thy fortunes proud .
We do not mean the coursing snatchers only , But fear the main intendment of the Scot , Who hath been still a giddy neighbor to us .
Tis no matter. , Go to the fellow , good Alexas .
At your request !
Then by your side no bed room me deny .
In good time , sir , what's that ?
What , still in tears , Evermore showering ?
Jove bless thee , master Parson .
My pretty cousins , you mistake me both .
Oh , that a lady of one man refused Should of another therefore be abused !
In faith , they are as true of heart as we .
How is 't with you , my most fair Bianca ?
A good swift simile , but something currish .
Farewell , thou lob of spirits .
Thou wouldst else have made thy tale large .
I am glad to see you well. , Horatio ?
True or false , it hath made thee Earl of Gloucester .
They see and smell And have their palates both for sweet and sour , As husbands have .
In the meantime , Let me be thought too busy in my fears , As worthy cause I have to fear I am , And hold her free , I do beseech your honor .
There , gentle Hermia , may I marry thee .
What wouldst thou ?
Let husbands know Their wives have sense like them .
Marry , and it shall be done tomorrow morning if I live .
Edward's unhappy sons do bid thee flourish .

But in my conscience , sir , I do not care for you .
I am Christophero Sly .
I should sin To think but nobly of my grandmother .
Nobody marks you .
Love's heralds should be thoughts , Which ten times faster glide than the sun's beams , Driving back shadows over louring hills .
I have no food for thee .
How died my master , Strato ?
Well , well .
For your coming in to dinner , sir , why , let it be as humours and conceits shall govern .
I may not , madam .
In thee there is not half an hour of life .
By this hand , I love thee .
And you , sir .
Come on and kiss me , Kate .
What , lamb !
O Lord !
Upon what bargain do you give it me ?
What is this ?
No , not a whit .
Who ever knew the heavens menace so ?
And I for Ganymede .
He has my dying voice .
As long as heaven and nature lengthens it .
Sir , speed you .
The wisdom of your duty , fair Bianca , Hath cost me an hundred crowns since suppertime .
He was wont to lend money for a Christian courtesy ; let him look to his bond .
No , wench !
Thanks , good Egeus .
Your cause of sorrow Must not be measured by his worth , for then It hath no end .
I think it be , sir .
She shows a body rather than a life , A statue than a breather .
Away with it !
The rest will comfort , for thy counsel's sound .

Nay , get thee gone .
They did so , to th ' amazement of mine eyes That looked upon 't .
Is that the law ?
He is my prisoner .
Go with my brothers to my lords of England .
I beseech you pardon me , my lord , if I be mistaken , for my duty can not be silent when I think your highness wronged .
Ay , for the state , not for Antonio .
Yea , very force entangles Itself with strength .
Ha !
Seyton !
And we'll consign thereto. , Will you , fair sister , Go with the princes or stay here with us ?

Lies all within. , Deliver me the key .
If a Jew wrong a Christian , what is his humility ?
That were the most if he should husband you .
He comes upon a wish .
O , wilt thou darkling leave me ?
I have sent to bid Cassio come speak with you .
No matter whither , so you come not here .
I'll tell the news .
What should I say to you ?
Happy be Theseus , our renowned duke .
How looked he ?
And never , since the middle summer's spring , Met we on hill , in dale , forest , or mead , By paved fountain , or by rushy brook , Or in the beached margent of the sea , To dance our ringlets to the whistling wind , But with thy brawls thou hast disturbed our sport .
Who is 't that calls ?
Damned as thou art , thou hast enchanted her !
Come , let's all take hands Till that the conquering wine hath steeped our sense In soft and delicate Lethe .
How long hath this possession held the man ?
Then tell me If this might be a brother .
You were to blame , I must be plain with you , To part so slightly with your wife's first gift , A thing stuck on with oaths upon your finger And so riveted with faith unto your flesh .
For he is , sure , i ' th ' island .
Many a morning hath he there been seen , With tears augmenting the fresh morning's dew , Adding to clouds more clouds with his deep sighs .
There's a strong fellow , Menas .
Stand !
Is 't far you ride ?
Let us not burden our remembrances with A heaviness that's gone .
Tomorrow will we be married .
Give me thy hand .
What dost you mean by this ?
Not so .
How much I had to do to calm his rage !
Madam , I will .
Of Albany's and Cornwall's powers you heard not ?
Soft , no haste .
Henceforward do your messages yourself .
Lady , come from that nest Of death , contagion , and unnatural sleep .
What should a man do but be merry ?
Dismount thy tuck , be yare in thy preparation , for thy assailant is quick , skillful and deadly .
Oh , that I were a glove upon that hand That I might touch that cheek !
You shall be a woodmonger and buy nothing of me but cudgels .
I know it pleaseth neither of us well .
What o'clock tomorrow Shall I send to thee ?
Come .
Caesar , I will .
Gifts that God gives .
Lead me .
I doubt it is no other but the main : His father's death and our o'erhasty marriage .
Write from us to him .
Is 't so , my lords of England ?
Oh , that I were a man for his sake !
Is 't possible ?
Not in a grave , To lay one in , another out to have .
Was ever woman in this humor won ?
This speed of Caesar's Carries beyond belief .
Dost thou think If I would stand against thee , would the reposal Of any trust , virtue , or worth in thee Make thy words faithed ?
Therefore speak .
What else , fellow ?
Thou torturest me , Tubal .
Methought I lay Worse than the mutines in the bilboes .
But yet , Which , of he or Adrian , for a good wager , first begins to crow ?
Know'st thou this country ?
What wood is this before us ?
Notwithstanding , use your pleasure .

One , gentlewoman , that God hath made , himself to mar .
Tear him to pieces .

So please my lord the duke and all the court , To quit the fine for one half of his goods I am content , so he will let me have The other half in use to render it Upon his death unto the gentleman That lately stole his daughter .
He started one poor heart of mine in thee .
Tis cowardly and womanish .
Shall I do such a deed ?
He left behind him myself and a sister , both born in an hour .
I am his brother , and I love him well .
Ere I learn love , I'll practice to obey .
Truly , sir , all that I live by is with the awl .
It may be so , my lord .
Adieu .
Oh , I am slain !
So , so , so , so !
Then wherefore should I doubt ?
Good morrow , General .
Why , thy godhead laid apart , Warr'st thou with a woman's heart ?
Madam , withdraw : the Prince , the Count , Signor Benedick , Don John , and all the gallants of the town are come to fetch you to church .
If we are marked to die , we are enough To do our country loss ; and if to live , The fewer men , the greater share of honor .

No ?
This will I also wear in my cap .
There's a division betwixt the dukes .
He is called Aunchient Pistol .
Now heaven help him !
Hear me yet , good Shylock .
Now will I go to take some privy order To draw the brats of Clarence out of sight , And to give order that no manner of person Have any time recourse unto the princes .
The day is broke .
Through the house give glimmering light , By the dead and drowsy fire .
Where dwell you , pretty youth ?
Thou art to die .
Thus answer I in the name of Benedick , But hear these ill news with the ears of Claudio .
Thou canst not speak of that thou dost not feel .
What's that ?
The reason that I gather he is mad , Besides this present instance of his rage , Is a mad tale he told today at dinner Of his own doors being shut against his entrance .
How is the man esteemed here in the city ?
Where's my cousin Toby ?
Is 't possible ?
Were you well served , you would be taught your duty .
I know not .
That's certain .

How is 't with me when every noise appals me ?
O coz , coz , coz , my pretty little coz , that thou didst know how many fathom deep I am in love .
By my troth , a good song .
Marry , as for Clarence , he is well repaid ; He is franked up to fatting for his pains .
I'll warrant she'll tax him home .
I know thou canst not choose .
And is he a man to encounter Tybalt ?
Many times , madam .
Yon light is not daylight , I know it , I .
Here's to thy health .

Where art thou , Pindarus ?
Those are the raised father and his friends .
I will depart in quiet And , in despite of mirth , mean to be merry .
My husband ?
What's to say ?
As it ebbs , the seedsman Upon the slime and ooze scatters his grain , And shortly comes to harvest .
And so return to you , and nothing else ?
We'll have thee , as our rarer monsters are , Painted on a pole , and underwrit , "Here may you see the tyrant." I will not yield , To kiss the ground before young Malcolm's feet , And to be baited with the rabble's curse .
The ship was under sail .
This blows my heart .
But yet I'll make assurance double sure , And take a bond of fate .
Who calls ?
A goodly one , in which there are many confines , wards , and dungeons , Denmark being one o ' th ' worst .
Then bring me to their sights .
Th ' exchange of thy love's faithful vow for mine .

What would you ?
What cheer , my love ? , Demetrius and Egeus , go along .
I will live in thy heart , die in thy lap , and be buried in thy eyes , and moreover , I will go with thee to thy uncle's .
One stroke Shall free thee from the tribute which thou payest .
I prithee , tell me who is it quickly , and speak apace .
What's the matter ?
But one , poor one , one poor and loving child , But one thing to rejoice and solace in , And cruel death hath catched it from my sight !
If this be so , why blame you me to love you ?
How now , gentleman ?
That's not so .
My old bones ache .
Canst thou so daff me ?
Go and tell them so .
I will presently go learn their day of marriage .
Pray you now , forget and forgive .
Most heathenish and most gross !

Where is my lord of Gloucester ?
O , help him , you sweet heavens !
Ha !
The spring , the summer , The childing autumn , angry winter change Their wonted liveries , and the mazed world , By their increase , now knows not which is which .
Thou hast braved many men ; brave not me .
O my brother's child !
I tell him we shall stay here at the least a month , and he heartily prays some occasion may detain us longer .
Why are you drawn ?
Commend me to thy mistress .
Master , you looked so longly on the maid , Perhaps you marked not what's the pith of all .

But were I Brutus , And Brutus Antony , there were an Antony Would ruffle up your spirits and put a tongue In every wound of Caesar that should move The stones of Rome to rise and mutiny .

Was ever man so weary ?
Pale or red ?
Here's Decius Brutus .
I have no more sons of the royal blood For thee to slaughter .
I have fair meanings , sir .
O ' Thursday be it , then. , Go you to Juliet ere you go to bed .

I pray you , pardon me .
How now , Grumio ?
Whence come you ?
But when they should endure the bloody spur , They fall their crests and , like deceitful jades , Sink in the trial .
You peers , continue this united league .
That is another simple sin in you , to bring the ewes and the rams together and to offer to get your living by the copulation of cattle ; to be bawd to a bellwether and to betray a she-lamb of a twelvemonth to a crooked-pated old cuckoldly ram , out of all reasonable match .
Good morrow , Casca. , Caius Ligarius , Caesar was ne'er so much your enemy As that same ague which hath made you lean .

The readiest way to make the wench amends Is to become her husband and her father ; The which will I , not all so much for love As for another secret close intent By marrying her which I must reach unto .
Counterfeit ?
Do as thou wilt , for I have done with thee .
Now , I prithee , daughter , do not make me mad .
Why ask you this ?
Look in my face .
If she be in her chamber or your house , Let loose on me the justice of the state For thus deluding you .
Why then , the beef , and let the mustard rest .
Come , sir , what letters had you late from France ?
Well , madam , and in health .

Faith , stay here this night .
Where is he now ?
A ripe age .
A husband ?

Sir , a whole history .
I would not spare my brother in this case If he should scorn me so apparently .
Sir , sir , I will have law in Ephesus , To your notorious shame , I doubt it not .
Our friends all stay for you .
O , gentlemen , see , see dead Henry's wounds Open their congealed mouths and bleed afresh ! , Blush , blush , thou lump of foul deformity , For 'tis thy presence that exhales this blood From cold and empty veins where no blood dwells .
You are resolute , then ?
Be it as you shall privately determine , Either for her stay or going .
Words before blows .

Madam , do you .
Of us must Pompey presently be sought , Or else he seeks out us .

Once more , adieu .
One word more , honest neighbors .
And his kissing is as full of sanctity as the touch of holy bread .

Brutus , bait not me .
Because their business still lies out o ' door .
God keep your Worship !
How oddly he is suited !
I know you are of her bosom .
Dove-feathered raven , wolvish-ravening lamb !
Or is the adder better than the eel Because his painted skin contents the eye ?
God keep your Lordship in that gracious mind .
I will do so .
I'll bear thy blame And take thy office from thee , on my peril .
You would all this time have proved there is no time for all things .

Where is Lucentio ?
Only in the world I fill up a place which may be better supplied when I have made it empty .

And did not I in rage depart from thence ?
There's Dolabella sent from Caesar .
Zounds , sir , you're robbed !
You mistake , sir , you mistake , sir .
What , thou speak'st drowsily ?

What other bond Than secret Romans that have spoke the word And will not palter ?
Master , mean you so ?
I durst , my lord , to wager she is honest , Lay down my soul at stake .
Peter , stay at the gate .
Know , Claudio , to thy head , Thou hast so wronged mine innocent child and me That I am forced to lay my reverence by , And with gray hairs and bruise of many days Do challenge thee to trial of a man .

You have served me well , And kings have been your fellows .
Tis so .
Tis so .
Make haste .
She hath spied him already with those sweet eyes .
Therefore my merchandise makes me not sad .
Heaven knows what she has known .
My people do already know my mind And will acknowledge you and Jessica In place of Lord Bassanio and myself .
Sit then and talk with her .
Ah , women , women !
Now you talk of a sheet of paper , I remember a pretty jest your daughter told .
Therefore forbear awhile .
Which of you trembles not that looks on me ?
Alas , what does this gentleman conceive ?
Wisdom and goodness to the vile seem vile .
By the eighth hour .
Why , then he'll say we stabbed him sleeping .
And she as much in love , her means much less To meet her new beloved anywhere .
And though I make this marriage for my peace , I' th' East my pleasure lies .
It shall be seven ere I go to horse .
Therefore , have done .
Dispatch .
Nor I , my lord .
One of these three contains her heavenly picture .
I can not love him .
Good my lord , enter .

The round world Should have shook lions into civil streets And citizens to their dens .
Then keep thy vow , sirrah , when thou meet'st the fellow .
All's but naught .

There's not a man I meet but doth salute me As if I were their well-acquainted friend , And every one doth call me by my name .
O thou bloody prison , Fatal and ominous to noble peers !
He is about the house .
Now , Catesby , what says his grace ?
Signior ?
For , by this light of heaven , I know not how I lost him .
There is no other way .
O most wicked fiend !
Dear sir , forbear !
But I know to be up late is to be up late .
Give welcome to my friend .
He hath rid his prologue like a rough colt .

Oh , you and I have heard our fathers say , There was a Brutus once that would have brooked Th ' eternal devil to keep his state in Rome As easily as a king .
Go release them , Ariel .
Braved in mine own house with a skein of thread ?
My good knave Eros , now thy captain is Even such a body .
Who now the price of his dear blood doth owe ?
Then I will come to my mother by and by .
My lord , he doth deny to come .
If I live to see it , I will never trust his word after .
Revenges burn in them , for their dear causes Would to the bleeding and the grim alarm Excite the mortified man .
So Fulvia told me .
Now quit you well. , Torches , torches !
If we do lose this battle , then is this The very last time we shall speak together .
Let's carve him as a dish fit for the gods , Not hew him as a carcass fit for hounds .
Fair Katherine , and most fair , Will you vouchsafe to teach a soldier terms Such as will enter at a lady's ear And plead his love suit to her gentle heart ?
How like you the young German , the Duke of Saxony's nephew ?
I will do any thing , Nerissa , ere I'll be married to a sponge .
Why , that's all one .
Is 't not the king ?
I prithee , who ?
But I feel not This deity in my bosom .
Better once than never , for never too late .
I am for it , lieutenant , and I'll do you justice .
And the best of me is diligence .
Monsieur the challenger , the Princess calls for you .
Come down .
But since he stands obdurate And that no lawful means can carry me Out of his envy's reach , I do oppose My patience to his fury , and am armed To suffer with a quietness of spirit The very tyranny and rage of his .
Fare thee well .
Didst thou hear these verses ?
How now , worthy soldier ?
Have you any commission from your lord to negotiate with my face ?
Who can control his fate ?
Sirrah , your father's dead .
O thou foul thief , where hast thou stowed my daughter ?
When this advice is free I give and honest , Probal to thinking and indeed the course To win the Moor again ?
I am sorry that I am deceived in him .
Life and these lips have long been separated .
My lord ?
Ha !
What mean your graces ?
You say you are a better soldier .
Farewell , kind master .
Let me tell you , Cassius , you yourself Are much condemned to have an itching palm , To sell and mart your offices for gold To undeservers .
I am not well .
Let us , Lepidus , not lack your company .
This letter from Bellario doth commend A young and learned doctor to our court .
Why , then All Souls ' Day is my body's doomsday .
I will weep .
Orsino .
Or else it stood upon the choice of friends , O hell , to choose love by another's eyes !
Give me some light , away !
What , will you have them weep our horses ' blood ?
You charge me most unjustly .
Approach , my Ariel , come .
This looks not like a nuptial .
Where did you leave him ?
Mark Antony is in your tents , my lord .
An 't be any way , it must be with valor , for policy I hate .
I will bestow a breakfast to make you friends ; and we'll be all three sworn brothers to France .
Holy Franciscan Friar !
O bosom black as death !
Though I wish thy death , I will not be the executioner .
Have I , my lord ?
You know , he brought me out o ' favor with my lady about a bear-baiting here .
That's very true , my lord .
Not for thy fairy kingdom. , Fairies , away !
The wind sits in the shoulder of your sail And you are stayed for .
A witty mother !
Come , go we to the king .
Fare you well at once .
Better it were they all came by his father , Or by the father there were none at all , For emulation who shall now be nearest Will touch us all too near if God prevent not .
No , Antony , take the lot .
Why , now , as fast as she can marry us .
How parted he with thee ?
Why , the hot-blooded France that dowerless took Our youngest born , I could as well be brought To knee his throne , and , squirelike , pension beg To keep base life afoot .
Farewell .
Give me particulars .
But I pray , can you read anything you see ?
I am not guilty of Lysander's blood .
Come hither , come !
The watery kingdom , whose ambitious head Spits in the face of heaven , is no bar To stop the foreign spirits , but they come As o'er a brook to see fair Portia .
If the English had any apprehension , they would run away .
My love thou art , my love , I think .
Can you deny all this ?
Since Cleopatra died I have lived in such dishonor that the gods Detest my baseness .
All blessed secrets , All you unpublished virtues of the earth , Spring with my tears .
Who is so gross That can not see this palpable device ?
And you must cut this flesh from off his breast .
My lord , he is but even now gone hence .
Yet I will adventure .
I'll not meddle with him .
Tut , I am in their bosoms , and I know Wherefore they do it .
These babes for Clarence weep and so do I ; I for an Edward weep ; so do not they .
I will employ thee back again ; I find thee Most fit for business .
If you like upon report The soil , the profit , and this kind of life , I will your very faithful feeder be And buy it with your gold right suddenly .
Tis not the king that sends you to the Tower .
Let us toward the king .
I hope he be in love .
Then your hose should be ungartered , your bonnet unbanded , your sleeve unbuttoned , your shoe untied , and everything about you demonstrating a careless desolation .
Yes , other men have ill luck too .
Charmian !
I'll apprehend him .
Poisoned , then .
Justice , find the girl !
Here's sport indeed !
Tell me , and dally not : where is the money ?
I say thou hast belied mine innocent child .
Why , man , I saw Bassanio under sail .
Draw the curtain straight .
If thy revengeful heart can not forgive , Lo , here I lend thee this sharp-pointed sword , Which if thou please to hide in this true breast And let the soul forth that adoreth thee , I lay it naked to the deadly stroke And humbly beg the death upon my knee .
O Brutus !
Come hither , neighbor Seacole .
Leave me with haste .
But yet I run before my horse to market .
Not now , sweet Desdemona .
Such welcome and unwelcome things at once 'T is hard to reconcile .
Let go , slave , or thou diest !
Expose thyself to feel what wretches feel , That thou mayst shake the superflux to them And show the heavens more just .
Be ruled .
A baubling vessel was he captain of , For shallow draught and bulk unprizable , With which such scathful grapple did he make With the most noble bottom of our fleet , That very envy and the tongue of loss Cried fame and honor on him. , What's the matter ?
Nor no one here , for curses never pass The lips of those that breathe them in the air .
How fares my lord ?
Ha !
In such a night as this !
You may have very fit occasion for 't .
Oh , this is the poison of deep grief .
Therefore stay yet .
Why have you left the chamber ?
So the maid that stood in the way for my wish shall show me the way to my will .
Tell me , heavenly bow , If Venus or her son , as thou dost know , Do now attend the queen ?
To a rope's end , sir , and to that end am I returned .
No , sir , no jot .
He hath been out nine years , and away he shall again .
Drunk ?
Your Grace is too costly to wear every day .
I have laid those sheets you bade me on the bed .
Caesar , thy thoughts Touch their effects in this .
Strike the vessels , ho !
Faith , here's an English tailor come hither for stealing out of a French hose .
Good even to my ghostly confessor .
But since it is as it is , mend it for your own good .
God keep me so. , Our heralds go with him .
Come .
I prithee , Remember I have done thee worthy service , Told thee no lies , made thee no mistakings , served Without or grudge or grumblings .
That methinks is strange .
Did you confer with him ?
For that you must But say I could not help it .
Very well .
I should ev'n die with pity To see another thus .
Fare you well .
I know my remedy .
And so they are .
This by Calphurnia's dream is signified .
Get you to bed , faith .
To be honest , as this world goes , is to be one man picked out of ten thousand .
You'll let us in , I hope ?
Cassius , what night is this !
But what is your affair in Elsinore ?
Truly , my name is Cinna .
Madam , in happy time , what day is that ?
Why , then , take no note of him , but let him go and presently call the rest of the watch together and thank God you are rid of a knave .
Yet his means are in supposition .
Teach it but how , And thou shalt see how apt it is to learn Any hard lesson that may do thee good .
Your brother is but young and tender , and , for your love I would be loath to foil him , as I must for my own honor if he come in .
Lucius , who's that knocking ?
What say'st thou , my fair flower de luce ?
What not put upon His spongy officers , who shall bear the guilt Of our great quell ?
Weigh it but with the grossness of this age , You break not sanctuary in seizing him .
Where we are , There's daggers in men's smiles .
O cursed , cursed slave !
And yet , to say the truth , reason and love keep little company together nowadays .
I care not for good life .
O come , Ventidius .
Murder !
Hence , and avoid my sight ! , So be my grave my peace as here I give Her father's heart from her. , Call France .
Susan and she , God rest all Christian souls ! , Were of an age .
Oh , most lame and impotent conclusion !
I think the best grace of wit will shortly turn into silence , and discourse grow commendable in none only but parrots .
One dead , or drunk ?
Is he married ?
And are not you my husband ?
Invest me in my motley .
Show 's the way , sir .
And leave us , Publius , lest that the people , Rushing on us , should do your age some mischief .
Why , fare thee well .
But did'st thou see them dead ?
An inviting eye , and yet methinks right modest .
I pray you and beseech you that you will .
By my troth , thou hast an open hand .
Why then , the devil give him good of it !
Welcome , Signior .
I humbly thank you for't .
Come , my spade .
Farewell .
You'll "never trust his word after." Come , 'tis a foolish saying .
Bid him levy straight The greatest strength and power that he can make And meet me suddenly at Salisbury .
You could never do him so ill-well unless you were the very man .
It is merely a lust of the blood and a permission of the will .
For me , three thousand ducats .
And yet , by the very fangs of malice I swear , I am not that I play .
What you would have I'll stay to know at your abandoned cave .
None but friends .
Best you safed the bringer Out of the host .
And true she is , as she hath proved herself .
Give me thy hand .
Sue to him again and he's yours .
Why rail'st thou on thy birth , the heaven , and earth ?
No , truly , but in friendly recompense .
No , we'll reason with him .
I have stayed for thee , God knows , in torment and in agony .
Why , give it to my wife , and fetch your money .
There's something in 't That is deceivable .
If I lose a scruple of this sport , let me be boiled to death with melancholy .
Be pleased to tell us , For this is from the present , how you take The offers we have sent you .
Before the days of change , still is it so .
Away , old man .
And for the more better assurance , tell them that I , Pyramus , am not Pyramus , but Bottom the weaver .
Now , my Titania , wake you , my sweet queen .
We have store to do 't , And they have earned the waste .
Fetch the will hither , and we shall determine How to cut off some charge in legacies .
And when she weeps , weeps every little flower , Lamenting some enforced chastity .
For love of God , forbear him .
And wilt thou have me ?
They do offend our sight .
Now , afore God , I am so vexed that every part about me quivers .
Bid him set on his powers betimes before , And we will follow .
O sir , content you .
Lo , she is one of this confederacy !
Let us all embrace .
Let me but move one question to your daughter , And by that fatherly and kindly power That you have in her , bid her answer truly .
There is no harm intended to your person , Nor to no Roman else .
Why , she hath a face of her own .
Now a little fire in a wild field were like an old lecher's heart , a small spark , all the rest on 's body cold .
Who hath he left behind him general ?
Thus I conceive by him .
And one Deformed is one of them .
Enough .
Great thing of us forgot ! , Speak , Edmund , where's the king ?
I have watched ere now All night for lesser cause , and ne'er been sick .
I will show you such a necessity in his death that you shall think yourself bound to put it on him .
Therefore we'll have some half a dozen friends , And there an end .
Do the boys carry it away ?
Be thou assured , good Cassio , I will do All my abilities in thy behalf .
Grim death , how foul and loathsome is thine image !
Where is thy luster now ?
Life , living , all is Death's .
Nay , you must call me Rosalind. , Come , sister , will you go ?
Let us go , For it is after midnight , and ere day We will awake him and be sure of him .
Peace yet again .
My cake is dough , but I'll in among the rest , Out of hope of all but my share of the feast .
And what wilt thou do , beg when that is spent ?
Why , headstrong liberty is lashed with woe .
But , sir , here comes your boy .
Now fare you well , good sir .
This lion is a very fox , for his valor .
It is good to grow .
Indeed , he hath an excellent good name .
Where's that mongrel ?
But for your private satisfaction , Because I love you , I will let you know .
Yet I love thee too .
I did .
Thou saidst , Oh , it comes o'er my memory , As doth the raven o'er the infectious house , Boding to all , he had my handkerchief .
Why looks your grace so heavily today ?
Here come the lovers , full of joy and mirth. , Joy , gentle friends !
Casca , by your voice .
Say then my peace is made .
Why do you speak so faintly ?
He is very busy about it .
But here's a parchment with the seal of Caesar .
Fair lady , by your leave , I come by note to give and to receive .
Alas , Malvolio , this is not my writing , Though , I confess , much like the character .
Stand here , make a good show on 't .
And , good boy , good night .
The French have reinforced their scattered men .
O woe !
My father compounded with my mother under the dragon's tail and my nativity was under Ursa Major , so that it follows I am rough and lecherous .
Sit i ' th ' middle .
Not for Cadwallader and all his goats .
Then will two at once woo one .
How long hath she been thus ?
You do advance your cunning more and more .
I am not gamesome .
We'll feast each other ere we part , and let's Draw lots who shall begin .
I have said .
Say you have wronged her , sir .
Did you not speak to it ?
I have no exquisite reason for 't , but I have reason good enough .
Ay , my lord .
He hath confessed .
Pray , have you not a daughter Called Katherina , fair and virtuous ?
O hated potion , hence !
Do it at once , Or thy precedent services are all But accidents unpurposed .
She can not deny it .
For we will fetters put upon this fear , Which now goes too free-footed .
She's but the sign and semblance of her honor .
First , there is the Neapolitan prince .
Scratching could not make it worse an 'twere such a face as yours were .
My lord and you were then at Mantua. , Nay , I do bear a brain. , But , as I said , When it did taste the wormwood on the nipple Of my dug and felt it bitter , pretty fool , To see it tetchy and fall out with the dug !
With this strange virtue , He hath a heavenly gift of prophecy , And sundry blessings hang about his throne , That speak him full of grace .
Pray ye , go .
Conscience , " say I , "you counsel well." "Fiend , " say I , "you counsel well." To be ruled by my conscience I should stay with the Jew my master , who , God bless the mark , is a kind of devil .
Patience , gentle Audrey .
My lord , I do protest , O , do not swear !
Brother , good night .
O , come in , equivocator .
Thou wast provoked by thy bloody mind , That never dream'st on aught but butcheries .
If without peril it be possible , Sweet Blunt , make some good means to speak with him , And give him from me this most needful note .
If it be a suit from the count , I am sick , or not at home .
I tell thee , Constable , my mistress wears his own hair .
Get you to bed on th ' instant , I will be returned Forthwith .
To the seaside straightway !
There lies your way .
How !
I speak in understanding .
I myself heard the king say he would not be ransomed .
Name Cleopatra as she is called in Rome .
A man , as you are .
Thy head is as full of quarrels as an egg is full of meat , and yet thy head hath been beaten as addle as an egg for quarreling .
I am doubtful that you have been conjunct And bosomed with her as far as we call hers .
But when I tell him he hates flatterers , He says he does , being then most flattered .
But one word more , He will not be commanded .
For charitable prayers Shards , flints and pebbles should be thrown on her .
At mine unworthiness , that dare not offer What I desire to give , and much less take What I shall die to want .
So do you too , where you perceive them thick .
Were you by when it began ?
Everyone hears that That can distinguish sound .
Fly ?
A could never abide carnation .
O most courageous day !
For , sir , It is as sure as you are Roderigo , Were I the Moor , I would not be Iago .
How now , brother Edmund ?
O , touch me not .
Marry , now I let go your hand , I am barren .
O Thou , whose captain I account myself , Look on my forces with a gracious eye .
He is very near by this .
What , are you hurt , lieutenant ?
And yet thou wilt tutor me from quarreling !
Stones have been known to move , and trees to speak .
Nor must not then be yielded to in this .
Most noble sir , arise .
By my troth , my lord , I can not tell what to think of it , but that she loves him with an enraged affection , it is past the infinite of thought .
Farewell , dear Father .
Who knows if Donalbain be with his brother ?
Cambio is changed into Lucentio .
And , to inure thyself to what thou art like to be , cast thy humble slough and appear fresh .
Henceforth I'll bear Affliction till it do cry out itself , "Enough , enough , " and die .
I am sure you both of you remember me .
Lead the way .
There's more depends on this than on the value .
Know'st thou Fluellen ?
That's more to me than my wetting .
There be fools alive , iwis , Silvered o'er , and so was this .
If thou dost find him tractable to us , Encourage him and show him all our reasons .
Was 't you that did so oft contrive to kill him ?
And if on earth he do not merit it , In reason he should never come to heaven .
Peace , you dull fool .
Where's the Master ?
I know you not .
To be now a sensible man , by and by a fool , and presently a beast !
But wherefore do you hold me here so long ?
Come , let me have a bigger .
Judge , O you gods , how dearly Caesar loved him !
Ha !
Many good morrows to my noble lord .
Time calls upon 's .
Safe , Antony .
But 'tis a spirit .
My dagger , little cousin ?
Thou shalt hold the opinion of Pythagoras ere I will allow of thy wits , and fear to kill a woodcock lest thou dispossess the soul of thy grandam .
He shall tell them so .
But wherefore , villain , didst thou kill my cousin ?
Hold , then .
I'll ask them .
God 'ild you , sir .
Pray you do not , sir .
Why , let her except , before excepted .
Come , come , we know your meaning , brother Gloucester .
Fare you well , Jessica .
I have seen her die twenty times upon far poorer moment .
Not in my husband's nose .
Where art thou , keeper ?
So he does indeed .
I am not bid for love .
No epilogue , I pray you , for your play needs no excuse .
God's bread !
Caesar is sad , and Lepidus , Since Pompey's feast , as Menas says , is troubled With the greensickness .
I have locked the letter in my closet .
Live a thousand years , I shall not find myself so apt to die .
Let's take leave of him .
By and by .
Ay , that's the way .
Wonder not till further warrant .
Caesar , all hail !
I say , we will have no more marriages .
O , then by day Where wilt thou find a cavern dark enough To mask thy monstrous visage ?
But it becomes me well enough , does 't not ?
Her mother hath many times told me so .
Why , Antony .
He followed you .
What shall be our sport , then ?
Oh , treble woe Fall ten times treble on that cursed head , Whose wicked deed thy most ingenious sense Deprived thee of !
Then know that from my soul I love thy daughter .
I have more care to stay than will to go .
We will behold his death .
Will you shog off ?
I long To hear the story of your life , which must Take the ear strangely .
The French is gone off , look you , and there is gallant and most prave passages .
O brave new world , That has such people in 't !
Hence , make your best of it .
See how she leans her cheek upon her hand .
If you do free your children from the sword , Your children's children quits it in your age .
How ?
My lord , I'll tell you that self bill is urged Which in th ' eleventh year of the last king's reign Was like , and had indeed against us passed But that the scambling and unquiet time Did push it out of farther question .
As you on him , Demetrius dote on you !
Sleep shall neither night nor day Hang upon his penthouse lid .
Despise me If I do not .
Soon at five o'clock , Please you , I'll meet with you upon the mart And afterward consort you till bedtime .
You are my elder .
I was the more deceived .
Behold it stained With his most noble blood .
Is he well ?
Nay , pursue him now , lest the device take air and taint .
Wilt thou set thy foot o ' my neck ?
Name what part I am for and proceed .
Out on thee , seeming !
My husband !
It is , my lord .
But died thy sister of her love , my boy ?
Half afeard to come .
Thus it must be .
I will deliver you or else lie for you .
Be collected .
Attend the lords of France and Burgundy , Gloucester .
Come , shall I make you two friends ?
The royal tree hath left us royal fruit , Which , mellowed by the stealing hours of time , Will well become the seat of majesty , And make , no doubt , us happy by his reign .
You , constable , are to present the Prince's own person .
But , look you , Cassius , The angry spot doth glow on Caesar's brow , And all the rest look like a chidden train .
He knows that you embrace not Antony As you did love , but as you feared him .
Know'st thou the way to Dover ?
Your honor calls you hence .
This contents .
Seigneur Valentio and his cousin Tybalt ; Lucio and the lively Helena." A fair assembly .
I had else been perfect , Whole as the marble , founded as the rock , As broad and general as the casing air .
I am afraid , methinks , to hear you tell it .
Who will go with me ?
They stand and would have parley .
I am called .
Meantime , but think how I may do thee good , And be inheritor of thy desire .
This was the most unkindest cut of all .
And I am such a tender ass , if my hair do but tickle me , I must scratch .
This fortification , gentlemen , shall we see 't ?
Then hadst thou had an excellent head of hair .
My charge was but to fetch you from the mart Home to your house , the Phoenix , sir , to dinner .
You are in the right .
By 'r lady , I think it be so .
Ha !
Then like a Roman bear the truth I tell .
Can not a plain man live and think no harm , But thus his simple truth must be abused With silken , sly , insinuating jacks ?
I am no more mad than you are .
Ah , that's a foul fault .
Slay !
Fie , fie , thou shamest thy shape , thy love , thy wit , Which , like a usurer , abound'st in all And usest none in that true use indeed Which should bedeck thy shape , thy love , thy wit .
I do entreat your grace to pardon me .
Sit down a while And let us once again assail your ears , That are so fortified against our story , What we have two nights seen .
We shall , my lord .
Thou troublest me ; I am not in the vein .
Gentlemen , can any of you tell me where I may find the young Romeo ?
I'll entreat for thee .
Go you to him from me .
Is your name Goneril ?
I do not like thy look , I promise thee .
Fetch me this herb , and be thou here again Ere the leviathan can swim a league .
Well , but what's o'clock ?
Then he shall have no odds .
Then did they imitate that which I composed to my courser , for my horse is my mistress .
This is some priory .
Some are born great , some achieve greatness , and some have greatness thrust upon 'em .
Question your Grace the late ambassadors With what great state he heard their embassy , How well supplied with noble counselors , How modest in exception , and withal How terrible in constant resolution , And you shall find his vanities forespent Were but the outside of the Roman Brutus , Covering discretion with a coat of folly , As gardeners do with ordure hide those roots That shall first spring and be most delicate .
Then there is the County Palatine .
My sickness grows upon me .
Why do people love you ?
What's he that now is going out of door ?
Yea , my lord .
Thou hast not , cousin .
This is mere madness .
Now , where's my wife ?
What , master , read you ?
They that stand high have many blasts to shake them , And if they fall , they dash themselves to pieces .
Amen .
I do not bid thee call .
Think on me , That am with Phoebus' amorous pinches black And wrinkled deep in time .
I am very glad to see you , signior .
Go , some of you , And bring these gentlemen where Hamlet is .
Their battles are at hand .
But beshrew my jealousy !
Where is he gone ?
She loves me , sure !
God made him and therefore let him pass for a man .
Come , in what key shall a man take you to go in the song ?
He lies tonight within seven leagues of Rome .
Dost thou love pictures ?
But , as you say , sir , let your bounty take a nap , I will awake it anon .
If not , I'll die your maid .
Go then , find me a meet hour to draw Don Pedro and the Count Claudio alone .
While he was yet in Rome His power went out in such distractions as Beguiled all spies .
O mischief strangely thwarting !
Oh , 'twill be admirable !
I will bring you thither .
Take my sword .
Fore heaven , an excellent song .
With all my heart .
I speak no treason .
I will seek him , sir , presently , convey the business as I shall find means , and acquaint you withal .
True .
I pray you , sir , what is he ?
I could make as true a boast as that if I had a sow to my mistress .
I will watch tonight .
O God , your only jig-maker .
She Is daughter to this famous Duke of Milan , Of whom so often I have heard renown But never saw before , of whom I have Received a second life .
Egypt , thou knew'st too well My heart was to thy rudder tied by th' strings , And thou shouldst tow me after .
I had rather to adopt a child than get it. , Come hither , Moor .
Sometimes from her eyes I did receive fair speechless messages .
No , boy .
You were sent for , and there is a kind of confession in your looks which your modesties have not craft enough to color .
Certain ones , then .
I understand a fury in your words , But not the words .
And where the worser is predominant , Full soon the canker death eats up that plant .
What says Lord Stanley ?
And bid her come hither .
Cassio did top her , ask thy husband else .
He attends here in the forest on the duke your father .
Take away the fool , gentlemen .
She shall not harm thee , Helena .
He swore he would never marry , and yet now , in despite of his heart , he eats his meat without grudging .
My mind hath been as big as one of yours , My heart as great , my reason haply more , To bandy word for word and frown for frown .
Bear it straight , And bring thy master home immediately .
For naught so vile that on the earth doth live But to the earth some special good doth give .
If what he might he is not , I would to heaven he were !
How's that ?
And so he goes to heaven .
Make me to see 't , or at the least so prove it That the probation bear no hinge nor loop To hang a doubt on , or woe upon thy life !
Let me live here ever .
Peace , ho !
I scorn you not .
Sinful Macduff , They were all struck for thee !
Do not say "banishment." Hence from Verona art thou banished .
Methinks the ground is even .
In private ?
Since they did plot The means that dusky Dis my daughter got , Her and her blind boy's scandaled company I have forsworn .
Nay , had I power , I should Pour the sweet milk of concord into hell , Uproar the universal peace , confound All unity on earth .
Shall we be sundered ?
Lechery , sir , it provokes and unprovokes .
Here's Cassio hurt by villains .
But to my mind , though I am native here And to the manner born , it is a custom More honored in the breach than the observance .
He would be crowned .
Sir , I can not .
I prithee , call him back .
But now I was the lord Of this fair mansion , master of my servants , Queen o'er myself .
Mine , and most of our fortunes tonight , shall be , drunk to bed .
What noise is that ?
Dream on , dream on , of bloody deeds and death .
Content , in faith .
You amaze me .
Well , daughter , and you gentlewomen all , Withdraw into a chamber by yourselves , And when I send for you , come hither masked .
Come , where's the chain ?
I was , but I do find more pain in banishment Than death can yield me here by my abode .
Abominable villain !
I protest I take these wise men that crow so at these set kind of fools no better than the fools ' zanies .
Richard of York , how fares our loving brother ?
It can not be that she hath done thee wrong .
Now entertain conjecture of a time When creeping murmur and the poring dark Fills the wide vessel of the universe .
Fly , fly , my lord .
Twas you we laughed at .
I will carry no crotchets .
Not being Fortune , he's but Fortune's knave , A minister of her will .
I would I were thy bird .
For you see , it is already in snuff .
God's arm strike with us !
How old are you , friend ?
But sure the bravery of his grief did put me Into a towering passion .
Nor know I aught But that he's well and will be shortly here .
Alas , poor shepherd , searching of thy wound , I have by hard adventure found mine own .
Such comfort as do lusty young men feel When well-appareled April on the heel Of limping winter treads .
Some haste , my lord !
You , as your business and desire shall point you , For every man has business and desire , Such as it is , and for my own poor part , Look you , I'll go pray .
Nay , faith , I'll see the church a ' your back , and then come back to my master's as soon as I can .
Leave me alone to woo him .
This is the foul fiend Flibbertigibbet .
That is my rest ; that is the rendezvous of it .
Look , here comes a lover of mine and a lover of hers .
You laugh when boys or women tell their dreams .
Lord , what though ?
Fairly spoke .
Look how our partner's rapt .
Now have I done a good day's work .
What means this jest ?
Where is the rascal cook ?
Well , look unto it .
Twill be a storm .
Had I your tongues and eyes , I'd use them so That heaven's vault should crack .
How is 't with you ?
I once did lend my body for his wealth , Which but for him that had your husband's ring Had quite miscarried .
What are his words ?
I must , she'll rail in the street else .
Who comes here ?
No , but the barber's man hath been seen with him , and the old ornament of his cheek hath already stuffed tennis balls .
Marry , that he had received a thousand ducats of Don John for accusing the Lady Hero wrongfully .
If you will live , lament .
Oh , God 'i ' good e'en .
Which is he that killed the deer ?
Most royal majesty , I crave no more than hath your highness offered .
I would exult , man .
Is not this something more than fantasy ?
Bind fast his corky arms .
You must bear with me .
I am very ill at ease , Unfit for mine own purposes .
But I pray you commend my counterfeiting to him .
My remembrance is very free and clear from any image of offense done to any man .
Yes , my conscience , He did us great good .
No , madam , I do but read madness .
Dost thou hold there still ?
I love thee well in that thou lik'st it not .
Tis brief , my lord .
Alack the day !
I have but with a cursitory eye O'erglanced the articles .
I have very poor and unhappy brains for drinking .
Soft , comes he not here ?
I like not that .
No , heavens forfend , I would not kill thy soul !
Now they are my men .
My good friends , I'll leave you till night .
Tell me , good my friend , What torch is yond that vainly lends his light To grubs and eyeless skulls ?
All is lost !
So .
And I must be from thence !
I mean in singing .
Look with thine ears .
This is Lucentio's house .

Royal wench !
Again !
Tis too narrow for your mind .
Now my charms are all o'erthrown , And what strength I have's mine own , Which is most faint .

I do but stay till your marriage be consummate , and then go I toward Aragon .
Adieu .
Why , she would hang on him As if increase of appetite had grown By what it fed on , and yet , within a month , Let me not think on 't .
Serve God .
No , uncle , but our crosses on the way Have made it tedious , wearisome , and heavy .
Why , what's a moveable ?
Although I hate her , I'll not harm her so .
Friends , begone .
What said Northumberland as touching Richmond ?
I'll halt after .
We will have such a prologue , and it shall be written in eight and six .
They are all but stomachs , and we all but food .
For Brutus , as you know , was Caesar's angel .
He did bewray his practice , and received This hurt you see striving to apprehend him .
This trick may chance to scathe you , I know what .
And when the cross blue lightning seemed to open The breast of heaven , I did present myself Even in the aim and very flash of it .
Call you this railing ?
Yet could I bear that too , well , very well .
Why then , my cousin , Margaret , and Ursula Are much deceived , for they did swear you did .
Company is coming here .
And laid the love juice on some true love's sight .
These are news indeed !
I shall be much bound to you for 't .
Let's ha ' 't , good Grumio .
Blind is his love and best befits the dark .
Hast any philosophy in thee , shepherd ?
Wert thou not my brother , I would not take this hand from thy throat till this other had pulled out thy tongue for saying so .
Troth , I think your other rebato were better .
Bear'st thou her face in mind ?
Murellus and Flavius , for pulling scarfs off Caesar's images , are put to silence .
How say you by this change ?
Then every soldier kill his prisoners .
Chill pick your teeth , zir .
Error i ' the bill , sir , error i ' the bill !
How goes the world with thee ?
Upon what sickness ?
Not we .
I took no more pains for those thanks than you took pains to thank me." That's as much as to say , "Any pains that I take for you is as easy as thanks." If I do not take pity of her , I am a villain .

I hope this reason stands for my excuse .
You wrong me , Brutus .
Didst perceive ?
Touch me not so near .
Her name is Katherina Minola , Renowned in Padua for her scolding tongue .
Your hand , Leonato .
Which soon he granted , Being an obstruct 'tween his lust and him .
O good Sir Toby , hold !

When Biondello comes , he waits on thee , But I will charm him first to keep his tongue .
I do not know , my lord , what I should think .
Go .
But as 'tis , We can not miss him .
His countenance likes me not .
Did I not meet thy friends ?
My villainy they have upon record , which I had rather seal with my death than repeat over to my shame .
By heavens , the duke shall know how slack you have been .
One , sir , that for his love dares yet do more Than you have heard him brag to you he will .
A gentleman ?
I never saw my father in my life .
I am debating of my present store , And by the near guess of my memory I can not instantly raise up the gross Of full three thousand ducats .
This way , my lord .
No , thou proud dream , That play'st so subtly with a king's repose .
I know not how to pray your patience , Yet I must speak .
But thy vile race , Though thou didst learn , had that in 't which good natures Could not abide to be with .
Why , how now , Stephano ?
Room !
God and our innocence defend and guard us !
Dry sorrow drinks our blood .
I will say for you .
Go in , and tell my lady I am gone , Having displeased my father , to Lawrence's cell To make confession and to be absolved .
But new struck nine .
Marry , at the very next turning turn of no hand , but turn down indirectly to the Jew's house .
O simple !
Sound , trumpet !
Go , girl .
Love news , in faith ?
Lead me on .
Thence we looked toward England And cited up a thousand fearful times , During the wars of York and Lancaster That had befall'n us .
Not if the small come first .
Tis far off , And rather like a dream than an assurance That my remembrance warrants .
Look how thou dream'st !
A mighty man of Pisa .
Trouble him no more Till further settling .
Here comes the Emperor .
Be better suited .
What error drives our eyes and ears amiss ?

Close by , my master .
You are a senator !
Out of my sight !
Pray thee , go seek him , and bring him to my tent .
Am I a married man or a bachelor ?
Shall we give o'er and drown ?
As great to me as late .
The laws are mine , not thine .
And , good night , sweet friend .
Yet at the first I saw the treasons planted .
Where are they ?
I look down towards his feet , but that's a fable .
I am none of his flirt-gills .
My resolution and my hands I'll trust , None about Caesar .
God will revenge it .
Do you find some occasion to anger Cassio , either by speaking too loud , or tainting his discipline , or from what other course you please , which the time shall more favorably minister .

I am content you shall entreat me stay , But yet not stay , entreat me how you can .
Come .

It must be by his death , and for my part I know no personal cause to spurn at him But for the general .
Let this pernicious hour Stand aye accursed in the calendar !
And I .
Beseech you , father .
Tis very good .
Lorenzo , and thy love .
Who comes with her ?
Why ever wast thou lovely in my eyes ?
Here is a wonder , if you talk of a wonder .
Vanish , or I shall give thee thy deserving , And blemish Caesar's triumph .
You shall do small respect , show too bold malice Against the grace and person of my master , Stocking his messenger .

Both , both , my lord. , This letter , madam , craves a speedy answer .
And now I do bethink me , it was she First told me thou wast mad , then camest in smiling , And in such forms which here were presupposed Upon thee in the letter .
No more light answers .
What is 't thou canst demand ?
All things shall be well .
And she can weep , sir , weep .
when 'twas a little prating thing. , Oh , there is a nobleman in town , one Paris , that would fain lay knife aboard , but she , good soul , had as lief see a toad , a very toad , as see him .
Thou , why , thou wilt quarrel with a man that hath a hair more or a hair less in his beard than thou hast .
Thy case , dear friend , Shall be my precedent .
Come , come , you're drunk .
My bounty is as boundless as the sea , My love as deep .
Was 't not the way ?
Go , rascals , go , and fetch my supper in .
Charmian , hark .
Are you acquainted with the difference That holds this present question in the court ?
This to be true I do engage my life .
Wilt thou go to bed , Malvolio ?
Let it work , For 'tis the sport to have the engineer Hoist with his own petard .
And so she doth , cousin .
My very hairs do mutiny , for the white Reprove the brown for rashness , and they them For fear and doting .
I am glad on 't .
Brutus , my country's friend .
Tomorrow shall you know our mind at full .
Wherein the toged consuls can propose As masterly as he .
True , my lord .
Oh , is this he ?
I warrant you , madam .
What is to be said to him , lady ?
Madam !
Virtue is no hornmaker , and my Rosalind is virtuous .
This is a most majestic vision , and Harmonious charmingly .
Do , good William .
March on , march on , since we are up in arms , If not to fight with foreign enemies , Yet to beat down these rebels here at home .
I will have nothing else but only this .
And mine shall .
Why , this is excellent .

O dear father , It is thy business that I go about .
Why , what's the matter ?
Kent , on thy life , no more .
Shut up your doors .
Dead art thou !
When we shall meet at compt This look of thine will hurl my soul from heaven And fiends will snatch at it .
I do , Mark Antony .
O traitors , villains !
Cassio knows you not .
This done , he took the bride about the neck And kissed her lips with such a clamorous smack That at the parting all the church did echo .
Get you a place .
No matter .
I am a villain .
But do not so .
Caesar's will ?
Yes , faith .
It is the part of men to fear and tremble When the most mighty gods by tokens send Such dreadful heralds to astonish us .
Do you confess the bond ?
Speak the speech , I pray you , as I pronounced it to you , trippingly on the tongue .
I'll then nor give nor hazard aught for lead .

Oh , defend me !
Pray , sir , be patient .
My precious Queen , forbear , And give true evidence to his love which stands An honorable trial .

So you shall .

Nay , let him alone .
A lady , sir , though it was said she much resembled me , was yet of many accounted beautiful .
Which of these is he ?
Madam , with all my heart .
So dear I loved the man that I must weep .
Menas , I'll not on shore .
Thou and thy meaner fellows your last service Did worthily perform , and I must use you In such another trick .
What company is this ?
As I stood here below , methought his eyes Were two full moons .
Oh , horrible , oh , horrible , most horrible !
Come , poor remains of friends , rest on this rock .
His life was gentle , and the elements So mixed in him that Nature might stand up And say to all the world , "This was a man." According to his virtue let us use him , With all respect and rites of burial .
Upon the stroke of four .
Let me know .
How is 't , brother !
When the wind is southerly , I know a hawk from a handsaw .
She's not fourteen .
Do thou for him stand .
He calls to horse , but will I know not whither .
What then ?
I had as lief be a Brownist as a politician .
So will I turn her virtue into pitch And out of her own goodness make the net That shall enmesh them all .
I am loath to tell you what I would you knew .
Farewell , sweet masters both .
Why came I hither but to that intent ?
Sir , are not you my father ?
Get thee to a nunnery , go .
I pray you watch about Signior Leonato's door , for the wedding being there tomorrow , there is a great coil tonight .
A sick man in sadness makes his will , A word ill urged to one that is so ill .
And though you know my inwardness and love Is very much unto the Prince and Claudio , Yet , by mine honor , I will deal in this As secretly and justly as your soul Should with your body .
Nay , pray you throw none away .
Is that the uttermost ?
I am thy father's spirit , Doomed for a certain term to walk the night And for the day confined to fast in fires , Till the foul crimes done in my days of nature Are burnt and purged away .
Let wantons light of heart Tickle the senseless rushes with their heels .
I must not say no .
I will , my lord .
I have no will to wander forth of doors , Yet something leads me forth .
Virtue ?
Something , sure , of state , Either from Venice , or some unhatched practice Made demonstrable here in Cyprus to him , Hath puddled his clear spirit , and in such cases Men's natures wrangle with inferior things , Though great ones are their object .
Take him for all in all .
Will not the ladies be afeard of the lion ?
What a man are you ?
Is not that he ?
I marvel Cambio comes not all this while .
It is no matter .
When Caesar lived , he durst not thus have moved me .
What was the last cry for ?

Indeed !
Our reasons are so full of good regard That were you , Antony , the son of Caesar , You should be satisfied .

O all you host of heaven !
On a moderate pace I have since arrived but hither .
There is none of my uncle's marks upon you .
God be wi ' you and keep you and heal your pate .
Thou , it seems , that calls for company to countenance her .
We'll hear the will .
To die , to sleep , No more , and by a sleep to say we end The heartache and the thousand natural shocks That flesh is heir to , 'tis a consummation Devoutly to be wished !
Tis some mischance , the cry is very direful .
Yet is this no charm for the toothache. , Old Signior , walk aside with me .
Hear my soul speak .
Look I so pale , Lord Dorset , as the rest ?
Dost thou hear ?
Their bloody sign of battle is hung out , And something to be done immediately .
Pah !
Give us kind keepers , heavens !
And yet I would not be thee , nuncle .
Death of thy soul !
Oh , villain !
God help thee , shallow man .
These are but wild and whirling words , my lord .
Let still the woman take An elder than herself .

Come between us , good Benvolio .
He goes before me and still dares me on .
For a fish without a fin , there's a fowl without a feather. , Go , get thee gone .

A friend of Antony's .
How now ?
Alas , what ignorant sin have I committed ?
Ay , my lord .
Here comes Sir Oliver. , Sir Oliver Martext , you are well met .
Yet my heart Throbs to know one thing .

The blow thou hadst Shall make thy peace for moving me to rage , And I will boot thee with what gift beside Thy modesty can beg .
Here were the servants of your adversary , And yours , close fighting ere I did approach .
More to know Did never meddle with my thoughts .
This is his sword .
Tis no matter .
Here's no knavery !
Go , you wild bedfellow , you can not soothsay .
Have you not set Lysander , as in scorn , To follow me and praise my eyes and face ?
Tis so ; and that self chain about his neck Which he forswore most monstrously to have .

O woeful time .
Besides , the knave is handsome , young , and hath all those requisites in him that folly and green minds look after .
If more thou dost perceive , let me know more .
Now , sir , what make you here ?
I speak not yet of proof .
When these prodigies Do so conjointly meet , let not men say , "These are their reasons .
What do you here alone ?
Never , till Caesar's three and thirty wounds Be well avenged , or till another Caesar Have added slaughter to the sword of traitors .
Help to bear this away where my hogshead of wine is , or I'll turn you out of my kingdom .
If this be so , why blame you me to love you ?
I thank you , madam .
Dear lady , Give me leave , beseech you .
Come , I'll go in with you .
Certainly my conscience will serve me to run from this Jew , my master .
What needs more words ?
Speak .
Was this before the king returned ?
Persuade me rather to be slave and sumpter To this detested groom .
May I know ?
He's not thy kinsman .
Upon what cause ?
Is he of God's making ?
I can stand well enough , and I speak well enough .
Oh , that we now had here But one ten thousand of those men in England That do no work today .
It shall be done .
These English woes will make me smile in France .
We are no tyrant , but a Christian king , Unto whose grace our passion is as subject As is our wretches fettered in our prisons .

Advise your fellows so .
The watchdogs bark .
The next Caesarion smite , Till by degrees the memory of my womb , Together with my brave Egyptians all , By the discandying of this pelleted storm Lie graveless till the flies and gnats of Nile Have buried them for prey !
Why do you speak to me ?
O lamentable day !
By Jupiter , Were I the wearer of Antonio's beard , I would not shave 't today .
Did not you speak ?
He says they can do nothing in this kind .
Hail , most dear Caesar !
That Petruchio came ?
He hath made me a Christian .
My lord , I have considered in my mind The late request that you did sound me in .
He says his name is Master Fer .

How will you live ?
How's the day ?

I am dying , Egypt , dying .
Did you never see the picture of "We Three" ?

I have seen you both .
Romeo , he cries aloud , "Hold , friends !
These three world-sharers , these competitors , Are in thy vessel .

Return to her , and fifty men dismissed ?
O Scotland , Scotland !
Very well .
Some good man bear him carefully from hence .

You are deceived .
The lieutenant is to be saved before the ancient .

What , were you snarling all before I came , Ready to catch each other by the throat , And turn you all your hatred now on me ?
How fine my master is !
Well , God give them wisdom that have it .
Take the hint Which my despair proclaims .
So many miseries have crazed my voice That my woe-wearied tongue is still and mute .
Well get you gone .

How with mine honor may I give him that Which I have given to you ?
What mean you , Caesar ?
To make an account of her life to a clod of wayward marl ?
Thy husband in thy bosom there lies dead , And Paris too .
Well , honor is the subject of my story .
To what end did I bid thee hie thee home ?
Now , by heaven , My blood begins my safer guides to rule , And passion , having my best judgment collied , Assays to lead the way .
Yet you are withered .
Signior Leonato , let the friar advise you .
Tempt him not so too far .
This rudeness is a sauce to his good wit , Which gives men stomach to digest his words With better appetite .
O ill-dispersing wind of misery !
But for a fine , quaint , graceful , and excellent fashion , yours is worth ten on 't .
But the great one that goes up the hill , let him draw thee after .

Your reason ?

One heart , one bed , two bosoms , and one troth .
Utter my thoughts ?
By my troth , 's not so good , and I warrant your cousin will say so .
No farther than the Tower , and , as I guess , Upon the like devotion as yourselves , To gratulate the gentle princes there .

O , that thou wert not , poor distressed soul !
Wherefore have these gifts a curtain before 'em ?
What is between you ?
I was always plain with you , and so now I speak my agitation of the matter .
The gods forbid !
Put up thy sword , Or manage it to part these men with me .
O God !
I am your spaniel .
Most gracious majesty !
Come , sir , will you aboard ?
Ay , to the proof , as mountains are for winds , That shakes not , though they blow perpetually .
Give you good morrow , sir .
True is it that we have seen better days And have with holy bell been knolled to church , And sat at good men's feasts and wiped our eyes Of drops that sacred pity hath engendered .

And here he stands .
O sweet mistress , speak !
O woeful sympathy , Piteous predicament !
Was not Charles , the duke's wrestler , here to speak with me ?

Each new morn New widows howl , new orphans cry , new sorrows Strike heaven on the face , that it resounds As if it felt with Scotland and yelled out Like syllable of dolor .
Demetrius , I will keep my word with thee .
Very vilely in the morning , when he is sober , and most vilely in the afternoon , when he is drunk .
An thou make minstrels of us , look to hear nothing but discords .
Gallants , I am not as I have been .
Aroint thee , witch ! " the rump-fed runnion cries .
Ere it be demanded , As like enough it will , I would have it copied .
Alack , what heinous sin is it in me To be ashamed to be my father's child !
Never make known what you have seen tonight .
Their malady convinces The great assay of art , but at his touch , Such sanctity hath heaven given his hand , They presently amend .
The wolves have preyed , and look , the gentle day , Before the wheels of Phoebus , round about Dapples the drowsy east with spots of grey .

Give me your hand .
In faith , lady , you have a merry heart .
Caesar , I go .
Prithee , peace .
Away before me to sweet beds of flowers .
Why of thy thought , Iago ?
So that if we will plant nettles or sow lettuce , set hyssop and weed up thyme , supply it with one gender of herbs or distract it with many , either to have it sterile with idleness , or manured with industry , why , the power and corrigible authority of this lies in our wills .

Wherefore storm you so ?
You call me misbeliever , cutthroat dog , And spet upon my Jewish gaberdine , And all for use of that which is mine own .
Ay , but these English are shrewdly out of beef .
But now in the division of the kingdom , it appears not which of the dukes he values most , for equalities are so weighed that curiosity in neither can make choice of either's moiety .

I had rather have my horse to my mistress .
I dare not , dear , Dear my lord , pardon , I dare not , Lest I be taken .
Good fool , some ink , paper , and light , and convey what I will set down to my lady .
My lord , upon the platform where we watch .
Supper is done , and we shall come too late .
Handkerchief , confessions , handkerchief !
I will have my revenge ere I depart his house .
How if fair and foolish ?
But tell me true , are you not mad indeed ?

Then , my queen , in silence sad , Trip we after the night's shade .
But had he such a chain of thee or no ?
Music such as charmeth sleep !
What would she have ?
Question enrages him .
But that still use of grief makes wild grief tame , My tongue should to thy ears not name my boys Till that my nails were anchored in thine eyes , And I , in such a desp'rate bay of death , Like a poor bark of sails and tackling reft , Rush all to pieces on thy rocky bosom .
Thou bloodier villain Than terms can give thee out !
If you shall send them word you will not come , Their minds may change .
Let Rome be thus informed .
And my heart too .
If he ask for me , I am ill and gone to bed .
My children too ?
Call !
Avoid , and leave him .
Who is 't that cried ?
Brief let me be .
Draw , you rogue , or I'll so carbonado your shanks .

Go you and tell her of it .
An if you plead as well for them As I can say "nay" to thee for myself , No doubt we bring it to a happy issue .
What mean'st thou , that thou help'st me not ?
If I say sooth , I must report they were As cannons overcharged with double cracks , So they doubly redoubled strokes upon the foe .
Not to kill him , having a warrant , but to be damned for killing him , from the which no warrant can defend me .
Is this a dagger which I see before me , The handle toward my hand ?
By my troth , Sir Toby , you must come in earlier o ' nights .
Drown cats and blind puppies !

Anon !
Thou shalt be pinched As thick as honeycomb , each pinch more stinging Than bees that made 'em .
Peace , I say !
To see a reverend Syracusian merchant , Who put unluckily into this bay Against the laws and statutes of this town , Beheaded publicly for his offense .
Now we speak upon our cue , and our voice is imperial .
My little spirit , see , Sits in a foggy cloud and stays for me .
For the Queen , I'll take her to my guard .
For mine own part , no offence to the general nor any man of quality , I hope to be saved .
Let it fall rather , though the fork invade The region of my heart .
Go then and muster men , but leave behind Your son George Stanley .
Grief of my son's exile hath stopped her breath .
Now , good sir , what are you ?
Are you not Kent ?
A holy day shall this be kept hereafter .
What says this leaden casket ?
What means this lady ?
Is Antony or we in fault for this ?
Though it be pity to see such a sight , it well becomes the ground .
Kill !
They vanished strangely .
So every bondman in his own hand bears The power to cancel his captivity .
I know it is the sun that shines so bright .
O conspiracy , Shamest thou to show thy dangerous brow by night When evils are most free ?
Why , what should you fear ?
Age , thou art shamed !
Who stays it still withal ?
My lady bade me tell you , that , though she harbors you as her kinsman , she's nothing allied to your disorders .
The consequence is , then , thy jealous fits Have scared thy husband from the use of wits .
Two of both kinds make up four .
And time is at his period .
While we were interchanging thrusts and blows , Came more and more and fought on part and part , Till the Prince came , who parted either part .
Remember what I have said .
How know you he loves her ?
Were not my doors locked up and I shut out ?
Do you not hear , fellows ?
Alas , I am the mother of these griefs .
Some grief shows much of love , But much of grief shows still some want of wit .
I am not drunk now .
That ever I should live to see thee dead .
Come hither , Fabian .
Soft , soft !
By my troth , well met .
This doth betoken The corse they follow did with desperate hand Fordo its own life .
If he be , he knows how to turn his girdle .
Are they "informed" of this ?
Nothing .
No , I am promised forth .
He lies not like the living .
Shall I say to you , "Let them be free !
Do you confess so much ?
What noise is this ? , Not dead ?
Gilded tombs do worms enfold .
I could munch your good dry oats .
The king himself is rode to view their battle .
Why hath thy queen Summoned me hither to this short-grassed green ?
Say that you love me not , but say not so In bitterness .
For the Dauphin , I stand here for him .
To prayers , to prayers , all lost !
Never was seen so black a day as this .
So let high-sighted tyranny range on Till each man drop by lottery .
In saying so , you shall but say the truth .
Therein the patient Must minister to himself .
Now sit we close about this taper here And call in question our necessities .
What say the augurers ?
O , thou didst prophesy the time would come That I should wish for thee to help me curse That bottled spider , that foul bunch-backed toad !
Bid that welcome Which comes to punish us , and we punish it , Seeming to bear it lightly .
Stand far off .
I would have daffed all other respects and made her half myself .
That can not be , since I am still possessed Of those effects for which I did the murder : My crown , mine own ambition , and my queen .
Why , I am glad on 't .
He's dead .
Therefore , my lords , omit no happy hour That may give furth'rance to our expedition ; For we have now no thought in us but France , Save those to God , that run before our business .
I conjure you by that which you profess , Howe'er you come to know it , answer me .
Fare you well .
I am not so reputed !
Prithee , say on .
Dost thou hear , Iago ?
The labor we delight in physics pain .
I am tame , sir .
Here's France and Burgundy , my noble lord .
Are you content to stay ?
And when I have my meed , I will away , For this will out , and then I must not stay .
Why , that's spoken like an honest drover ; so they sell bullocks .
For first was he contract to Lady Lucy , Your mother lives a witness to that vow , And afterward by substitute betrothed To Bona , sister to the king of France .
And , Demetrius , The more you beat me , I will fawn on you .
Then be thou jocund .
I fear your disposition .
Now , if you love me , stay .
There lock yourself and send him word you are dead .
For besides these beneficial news , it is the celebration of his nuptial .
Ay , or very falsely pocket up his report .
Why , gentle sweet , you shall see no such thing .
I must believe my master ; else , I promise you , I should be arguing still upon that doubt .
This lanthorn doth the horned moon present .
Shalt see thy other daughter will use thee kindly .
Now lies he there , And none so poor to do him reverence .
You forget yourself To hedge me in .
O , let me think on Hastings and be gone To Brecknock , while my fearful head is on !
What have you done , my lord , with the dead body ?
I know not that , when he knows what I know .
Be angry when you will , it shall have scope .
Oh , you are men of stones .
She , dying , as it must so be maintained , Upon the instant that she was accused , Shall be lamented , pitied and excused Of every hearer .
Come hither , herald. , Let the trumpet sound , , And read out this .
Tis more , 'tis more .
Do thy worst .
I would have him nine years a-killing .
If thou account'st it shame , lay it on me , And therefore frolic !
Twas I , but 'tis not I. I do not shame To tell you what I was , since my conversion So sweetly tastes , being the thing I am .
The treacherous instrument is in thy hand , Unbated and envenomed .
I love thee not .
Censure me in your wisdom , and awake your senses that you may the better judge .
Will you give thanks , sweet Kate , or else shall I ? , What's this ?
Tell us the manner of it , gentle Casca .
Uncouple in the western valley .
How have you made division of yourself ?
By the world , I think my wife be honest and think she is not .
He is not doubted. , A word , Lucillius .
Oh , that's a brave man .
Then will I lay the serving creature's dagger on your pate .
Exclaim no more against it .
There be some such , no question .
So am I purposed .
Give ear , sir , to my sister .
Five hundred poor I have in yearly pay , Who twice a day their withered hands hold up Toward heaven to pardon blood .
So the poor third is up , till death enlarge his confine .
Then plainly to her tell my loving tale .
Ay , but not yet to die !
Speak .
If I could bid the fifth welcome with so good a heart as I can bid the other four farewell , I should be glad of his approach .
No ?
And in part him , but , " you may say , "not well .
But I'll not chide thee .
Read it , Mark Antony !
And unrespective boys .
Oh , villain that I am !
Why , so didst thou .
If you be pleased , retire into my cell And there repose .
Tomorrow dinner , then ?
For the love o ' God , peace !
I am satisfied .
Not a drop before .
Signior Baptista , will you be so strange ?
Do so .
Unless he have a fancy to this foolery , as it appears he hath , he is no fool for fancy , as you would have it appear he is .
In his tongue .
My lord !
You say you do not know the lady's mind .
Thou dost see I eat .
And 'tis great pity that the noble Moor Should hazard such a place as his own second With one of an ingraft infirmity .
Hamlet , thou art slain .
What are you ?
I prithee , foolish Greek , depart from me .
Where yond pine does stand I shall discover all .
Oh , help , ho !
No .
Humbly , sir , I thank you .
His glory not extenuated wherein he was worthy , nor his offenses enforced for which he suffered death .
Good morrow , Father .
I will go seek the king .
Welcome to Rome .
Yet he hath ever but slenderly known himself .
Despair and die !
Then must you speak Of one that loved not wisely , but too well .
I will answer you with gait and entrance .
He is no less than a stuffed man .
My money is almost spent , I have been tonight exceedingly well cudgeled , and I think the issue will be I shall have so much experience for my pains .
Go thou .
Did you ne'er hear say , "Two may keep counsel , putting one away" ?
What players are they ?
What , not a word ?
Yet here's a spot .
The more the pity that some honest neighbors will not make them friends .
You were best to tell Antonio what you hear , Yet do not suddenly , for it may grieve him .
I will not shame myself to give you this .
Happiest of all is that her gentle spirit Commits itself to yours to be directed As from her lord , her governor , her king .
And stand indebted , over and above , In love and service to you evermore .
The king is mad .
For shame , you generals !
Now let it work .
Did you perceive how he laughed at his vice ?
You go to seek the Lord Hamlet .
Or , if you will , Come home to me , and I will wait for you .
A fire , good Curtis .
Will 't please your Mightiness to wash your hands ?
Adieu , adieu , adieu .
Go to , say you nothing .
It would make a man mad as a buck to be so bought and sold .
Hence , get thee gone , and follow me no more .
Adieu .
The gallants desire it .
I am much afeard my lady his mother played false with a smith .
Say she be mute and will not speak a word ; Then I'll commend her volubility , And say she uttereth piercing eloquence .
Caesar ?
Be you his eunuch , and your mute I'll be .
I'll rather kill myself .
Why , shall we turn to men ?
Now , by my sword , And target .
For me , with sorrow I embrace my fortune .
Ratcliffe , come hither .
But for the seventh cause .
To be acknowledged , madam , is o'erpaid .
Why , I am sure , if he forfeit thou wilt not take his flesh .
Oh , he's a lovely gentleman .
Away with the joint-stools , remove the court-cupboard , look to the plate .
To bed , to bed .
Tybalt , my cousin !
There's husbandry in heaven ; Their candles are all out .
Whip him , fellows , Till like a boy , you see him cringe his face And whine aloud for mercy .
O Friar , the damned use that word in hell .
Tennis balls , my liege .
Petruchio is my name , Antonio's son , A man well known throughout all Italy .
Swear not by time to come , for that thou hast Misused ere used , by times ill-used o'erpast .
Why , how should she be murdered ?
I'll run from thee and hide me in the brakes , And leave thee to the mercy of wild beasts .
Hazard for lead ?
Thou know'st 'tis common .
Well , well , well .
My news shall be the fruit to that great feast .
Pray you , leave your courtesy , good monsieur .
Cassio , my lord ?
All's well .
I say I love thee more than he can do .
Upon the platform , 'twixt eleven and twelve , I'll visit you .
His reared arm Crested the world .
Why , then you must .
The sleeping and the dead Are but as pictures .
To make society The sweeter welcome , we will keep ourself Till suppertime alone .
My men should call me "lord." I am your goodman .
All the conspirators save only he Did that they did in envy of great Caesar .
Know him I shall , I am well sure of it .
Truly , she makes a very good report o' th' worm .
Is thy name Tyrrel ?
The mobled queen" ?
But as all is mortal in nature , so is all nature in love mortal in folly .
What soldiers , whey-face ?
He is much changed .
What hath he said ?
I remember The first time ever Caesar put it on .
He breathes , my lord .
Take it , brave York .
My life were better ended by their hate Than death prorogued , wanting of thy love .
Well met , my lord .
No further , sir .
Dead , I think. , Help , uncle ! , Hero , why , Hero !
Besides , they all are fresh .
What poor an instrument May do a noble deed !
To serve me well , you all should do me duty : Teach me to be your queen , and you my subjects .
Farewell .
Helen , to you our minds we will unfold .
Let me endure your wrath , if 't be not so .
What , Nurse , I say !
Then I will give you the serving creature .
Look , here comes Helena .
The enemy increaseth every day .
Regan , I have good hope Thou didst not know on 't. , Who comes here ?
Marry , sir , they have committed false report ; moreover , they have spoken untruths ; secondarily , they are slanders ; sixth and lastly , they have belied a lady ; thirdly , they have verified unjust things ; and , to conclude , they are lying knaves .
What dost thou mean ?
There's other business for thee .
That with this little arm and this good sword I have made my way through more impediments Than twenty times your stop .
Therefore go with me .
The what ?
To Baptista Minola .
I thank thee , master .
But goes thy heart with this ?
Not being the worst Stands in some rank of praise .
Do you not jest ?
Well , Syracusian , say in brief the cause Why thou dep-artedst from thy native home And for what cause thou camest to Ephesus .
Give me Bianca for my patrimony .
Let him answer me. , Come , follow me , boy .
I'll pull thee by the lesser legs .
Yours by this hand .
Call up the right Master Constable .
Oh , such another sleep , that I might see But such another man !
Never , Iago .
List , list , O , list !
That light we see is burning in my hall .
If I find a hole in his coat , I will tell him my mind .
When were you wont to be so full of songs , sirrah ?
Tonight in Harfleur will we be your guest ; Tomorrow for the march are we addressed .
The one of them contains my picture , Prince .
Hie you to the cell .
A foe to tyrants , and my country's friend .
So should he look That seems to speak things strange .
How do you , Malvolio ?
And here much Orlando .
I would thou hadst told me of another father .
Illo , ho , ho , my lord !
Have patience and endure .
O , quicken them with thine !
I will be near to second your attempt , and he shall fall between us .
Before you can say "Come" and "Go , " And breathe twice and cry "So , so ! " Each one , tripping on his toe ,
He is or ta'en or slain .
Who would fardels bear , To grunt and sweat under a weary life , But that the dread of something after death , The undiscovered country from whose bourn No traveler returns , puzzles the will And makes us rather bear those ills we have Than fly to others that we know not of ?
Monster , your fairy , which you say is a harmless fairy , has done little better than played the jack with us .
What , my lord ?
There lies that Tybalt .
Dar'st thou resolve to kill a friend of mine ?
I robbed his wound of it .
I had myself notice of my brother's purpose herein and have by underhand means labored to dissuade him from it ; but he is resolute .
I have heard more since .
Grave sir , hail !
But then I saw no harm , and then I heard Each syllable that breath made up between them .
If it be you that stir these daughters ' hearts Against their father , fool me not so much To bear it tamely .
My lord .
Or , if his mind be writ , give me his letter .
Away !
Thou villain Capulet !
Before and apace .
O you sir , you , come you hither , sir .
Shall , Antipholus , Even in the spring of love thy love-springs rot ?
Sir boy , I'll whip you from your foining fence , Nay , as I am a gentleman , I will .
Thus hath the candle singed the moth .
Think you my uncle did dissemble , grandam ?
And nothing is at a like goodness still .
Well .
I fear me you'll be in till then .
Ay , my lord .
We'll lead you thither .
Never talk to me .
Come out o ' th ' storm .
My reputation , Iago , my reputation !
I'll tarry no longer with you .
Thou dost mean something .
Such have but a shadow's bliss .
That the soul of our grandam might haply inhabit a bird .
Help , ho !
Now are we well prepared to know the pleasure Of our fair cousin Dauphin , for we hear Your greeting is from him , not from the king .
I must be one of these same dumb wise men , For Gratiano never lets me speak .
I prithee , shepherd , if that love or gold Can in this desert place buy entertainment , Bring us where we may rest ourselves and feed .
She is drowned already , sir , with salt water , though I seem to drown her remembrance again with more .
The wine of life is drawn , and the mere lees Is left this vault to brag of .
The noblest deer hath them as huge as the rascal .
My news I might have told hereafter .
Lord of lords !
But if thy love were ever like to mine , As sure I think did never man love so , How many actions most ridiculous Hast thou been drawn to by thy fantasy ?
His excellence did earn it , ere he had it .
Keep thee warm .
To Adriana .
Hark , canst thou hear me ?
So long ?
Your old smock brings forth a new petticoat , and indeed the tears live in an onion that should water this sorrow .
Both , both , my girl .
Oh , do-de , do-de , do-de .
Thou changed and self-covered thing , for shame !
I thank my stars I am happy .
Not so , neither .
From Athens is her house remote seven leagues , And she respects me as her only son .
I would not be mad .
Dromio , nor thou ?
Calphurnia !
My love , my life , my soul , fair Helena !
And for his cowardship , ask Fabian .
Speak the word along .
Ay , madam .
Lady , amen .
In wisdom I should ask thy name .
Where is the gold I gave in charge to thee ?
I will .
I say "amen."
Cast on no water .
No sovereignty , Yet he would be king on 't .
Dear master , I can go no further .
Let four captains Bear Hamlet like a soldier to the stage , For he was likely , had he been put on , To have proved most royally .
Sing it tonight .
My hearty friends , You take me in too dolorous a sense , For I spake to you for your comfort , did desire you To burn this night with torches .
Up to the breach , you dogs !
That thou shalt see the difference of our spirit , I pardon thee thy life before thou ask it .
This is open .
It shall go hard if "Cambio" go without her .
So I , to find a mother and a brother , In quest of them , unhappy , lose myself .
Cleopatra , Think you there was or might be such a man As this I dreamt of ?
Suffolk first died , and York , all haggled over , Comes to him where in gore he lay insteeped And takes him by the beard , kisses the gashes That bloodily did yawn upon his face .
Hark !
I have too grieved a heart To take a tedious leave .
And here's another , whose warped looks proclaim What store her heart is made on .
I'll help you , Sir Toby , because we'll be dressed together .
My noble lords and cousins all , good morrow .
A heavy sight !
A spirit ?
They have all stomachs .
And , friends , disperse yourselves .
Would I were able to load him with his desert !
Who shall bar me from them ?
Claudio !
I charge thee , hence , and do not haunt me thus .
Or have we eaten on the insane root That takes the reason prisoner ?
Tell me .
My father watches .
Come hither , fellow .
Then must thou needs find out new heaven , new earth .
I fear it is too choleric a meat .
Do they hold the same estimation they did when I was in the city ?
Are our eyes our own ?
I would I were , to be revenged on thee .
So .
Marry , come up , I trow .
I know this , and thus I challenge it .
Seven of my people , with an obedient start , make out for him .
He hath left them you And to your heirs forever , common pleasures , To walk abroad and recreate yourselves .
There's another garment for 't .
First kiss me , Kate , and we will .
What news , my lord ?
I shall break The cause of our expedience to the Queen And get her leave to part .
I can not tell .
O sir , very well : here in your orchard .
Yet would not so have been , Durst I have done my will .
Hero itself can blot out Hero's virtue .
Go , my dread lord , to your great-grandsire's tomb , From whom you claim .
My cousin's a fool , and thou art another .
It is a creature That dotes on Cassio , as 'tis the strumpet's plague To beguile many and be beguiled by one .
Master , master , look about you .
Howl , howl , howl , howl !
Gentlemen both , you will mistake each other .
For once upon a raw and gusty day , The troubled Tiber chafing with her shores , Caesar said to me , "Darest thou , Cassius , now Leap in with me into this angry flood And swim to yonder point ? " Upon the word , Accoutred as I was , I plunged in And bade him follow .
I'll have some proof .
God grant we never may have need of you .
Withdraw , my lord .
Mark , King of Scotland , mark : No sooner justice had , with valor armed , Compelled these skipping kerns to trust their heels , But the Norweyan lord , surveying vantage , With furbished arms and new supplies of men , Began a fresh assault .
Tell me thine first .
There's mine .
Who does beguile you ?
Who heard me to deny it or forswear it ?
Hence !
If a bloody coxcomb be a hurt , you have hurt me .
I would have her learn , my fair cousin , how perfectly I love her , and that is good English .
In sooth , I know not why I am so sad .
Crack thy frail case ! , Apace , Eros , apace .
You are thought here to be the most senseless and fit man for the constable of the watch ; therefore bear you the lantern .
Where have you hid yourself ?
What things are these , my lord Antonio ?
Oh , he hath murdered his master !
I know not , lady .
You are to blame , my lord , to rate her so .
Why art thou angry ?
Ha , ha , are you honest ?
I fear thou wilt once more come again for a ransom .
It was about to speak when the cock crew .
I know no news , my lord .

I will confess it to all the 'orld .
What hath quenched them hath given me fire .
Bear it coldly but till midnight and let the issue show itself .
I am unfit for state and majesty .
I was enforced to send it after him .
I would fain learn to lie .
And the tears of it are wet .
Have we devils here ?
I hope we have reformed that indifferently with us , sir .
I will fetch you light , and paper , and ink .
If I myself , there is no hour so fit As Caesar's death's hour , nor no instrument Of half that worth as those your swords , made rich With the most noble blood of all this world .
Humbly I thank your grace .
Thence I have followed it , Or it hath drawn me rather .
But , like a misbehaved and sullen wench , Thou pout'st upon thy fortune and thy love .
Any strange beast there makes a man .
Madam , I had rather seal my lips Than to my peril speak that which is not .
How answer you that ?
A most miraculous work in this good king , Which often since my here-remain in England I have seen him do .
God ye good morrow , gentlemen .
He will not know what all but he do know .
Ready , so please your grace .
In thy foul throat thou liest .

Yield , cur .
Good night , honest Iago .

I know when one is dead and when one lives .
tis a lost fear .
He's bound unto Octavia .
Where is Duncan's body ?
I can not speak your England .
Father , I charge thee , by thy reverence , Here to unfold ( though lately we intended To keep in darkness what occasion now Reveals before 'tis ripe ) what thou dost know Hath newly passed between this youth and me .
Then there were two cousins laid up , when the one should be lamed with reasons and the other mad without any .

Marvelous sweet music !
O bloody Richard !
You are very sensible , and yet you miss my sense : I mean , Hortensio is afeard of you .
How shall we find the concord of this discord ?
The lunatic , the lover , and the poet Are of imagination all compact .
Is now become a god , and Cassius is A wretched creature and must bend his body If Caesar carelessly but nod on him .
This , by his voice , should be a Montague. , What , dares the slave Come hither , covered with an antic face , To fleer and scorn at our solemnity ?

No , cousin , I'll to Fife .
So are those crisped snaky golden locks Which maketh such wanton gambols with the wind , Upon supposed fairness , often known To be the dowry of a second head , The skull that bred them in the sepulcher .
Heavens shield Lysander if they mean a fray !
O soft , sir !
But come , your Bergomask .
Then is Caesar and he forever knit together .
Said you so ?
Wilt thou destroy him then ?
Why are you virtuous ?
And so am I for no woman .
I am sorry to give breathing to my purpose , Help me away , dear Charmian !
Is my lord well , that he doth speak so wide ?
A good matter , surely .
And can you by no drift of conference Get from him why he puts on this confusion , Grating so harshly all his days of quiet With turbulent and dangerous lunacy ?
I am sorry that with better heed and judgment I had not quoted him .
No , uncle , I'll none .

I wish your Worship well .
Crowns in my purse I have and goods at home , And so am come abroad to see the world .

I will kiss thy lips .
Two things are to be done : My wife must move for Cassio to her mistress .
Why , every day , tomorrow .
Why no , no more than reason .
For this present , I would not , so with love I might entreat you , Be any further moved .
I hope thou art not mad .
Of that there's none , or little .
I prithee , turn aside and weep for her .
Would I could answer This comfort with the like .
She replied It should be better he became her guest , Which she entreated .
God pardon them that are the cause thereof .
Will you let it fall ?
There is one within , Besides the things that we have heard and seen , Recounts most horrid sights seen by the watch .
Oh , my pardon !
Tell him , when that our princely father York Blessed his three sons with his victorious arm , He little thought of this divided friendship .
That's my brave lord !
O , name him not .
I say unto thee , I bid thy master cutout the gown , but I did not bid him cut it to pieces .
All's hushed as midnight yet .
Hence , Mardian , And bring me how he takes my death .
Sir Toby Belch !
Nay , come , I prithee .
I thank God , I thank God !
Will you go , sister ? , Shepherd , ply her hard .
Thy husband .
It should seem then that Dobbin's tail grows backward .
She is too fair , too wise , wisely too fair , To merit bliss by making me despair .
Tis figured in my tongue .
Question it , Horatio .
Peace , ho !
But , brother , I can tell you strange news that you yet dreamt not of .
Where's Romeo ?
Now attest That those whom you called fathers did beget you .
Whether this be Or be not , I'll not swear .
Didst not mark that ?
The heavens forbid But that our loves and comforts should increase , Even as our days do grow .
This tyrant , whose sole name blisters our tongues , Was once thought honest .
Not tonight , good Iago .
Then let your servants bring my husband forth .
In each thing give him way .
But I perceive in you so excellent a touch of modesty that you will not extort from me what I am willing to keep in .
Canst thou blame him ?
Tybalt , the reason that I have to love thee Doth much excuse the appertaining rage To such a greeting .
Pass !
This is a slave whose easy borrowed pride Dwells in the fickle grace of her he follows. , Out , varlet , from my sight !
He knows I know him well .
Nay , go not back .
Come , thou mortal wretch , With thy sharp teeth this knot intrinsicate Of life at once untie .
So shall you feel the loss , but not the friend Which you weep for .
He raised the house with loud and coward cries .
Go , vanish into air , away !
None good , my liege , to please you with the hearing , Nor none so bad but well may be reported .
So is mine. , Do you hear , monster ?
Obey you , love you , and most honor you .
The rate , Well , Shylock , shall we be beholding to you ?
He might have chid me so , for , in good faith , I am a child to chiding .
I will not .
I must catechise you for it , madonna .
How cheerest thou , Jessica ?
It is now high suppertime , and the night grows to waste .
Catesby , o'erlook the walls .
Thou call'st on him that hates thee .
And though we lay these honors on this man To ease ourselves of divers slanderous loads , He shall but bear them as the ass bears gold , To groan and sweat under the business , Either led or driven , as we point the way .
Beyond imagination is the wrong That she this day hath shameless thrown on me .
For by the way I'll sort occasion , As index to the story we late talked of , To part the queen's proud kindred from the prince .
The gold I gave to Dromio is laid up Safe at the Centaur , and the heedful slave Is wandered forth , in care to seek me out .
How ?
The king comes here tonight .
Am I not wise ?
In , or we are spoiled .
Let him kill one first .
Such a one is a natural philosopher .
No more but so ?
O Bottom , thou art changed !
One that old Frederick , your father , loves .
If he come not , then the play is marred .
But though they jump not on a just account , As in these cases , where the aim reports 'T is oft with difference , yet do they all confirm A Turkish fleet , and bearing up to Cyprus .
Good night to you .
Yet thou liest in the bleak air .
Believe me , no .
How goes the night , boy ?
Come , instance .
He has broke my head across and has given Sir Toby a bloody coxcomb too .
Saints do not move , though grant for prayers ' sake .
I am peppered , I warrant , for this world .
Thou mightst have done this without thy beard and gown .
I tell thee true .
What's thy name ?
Where's Antony ?
I could marry this wench for this device .
Amen , amen .
No , sir , I live by the church .
With meditating that she must die once , I have the patience to endure it now .
Indeed , my lord , you made me believe so .
Hence , be gone , away !
Within these three days let me hear thee say That Cassio's not alive .
Forgot you !
Well , I would you did like me .
How idly do they talk !
What is thy name ?
I never gave him any .
Twill be ill taken .
I am the youngest of that name , for fault of a worse .
Who chooseth me shall get as much as he deserves." I will assume desert. , Give me a key for this , And instantly unlock my fortunes here .
One ever near thee .
Why , very well then .
I partly feel thee .
It is the quality o ' th ' climate .
But let it be .
Give them way till he take leave , and presently after him .
Where is Montjoy the herald ?
I have it here about me .
Well , your imprisonment shall not be long .
The rest are princes , barons , lords , knights , squires , And gentlemen of blood and quality .
Oh , brave Iago , honest and just , That hast such noble sense of thy friend's wrong !
Madam , with much ado .
The tender prince Would fain have come with me to meet your Grace , But by his mother was perforce withheld .
O mercy , God !
How doth the lady ?
We will speak further .
Give me thy arm .
I am amazed and know not what to say .
Under Sir Thomas Erpingham .
No , my good lord .
Wherefore speaks he this To her he hates ?
Know you not the cause ?
Be bold , and take thy stand .
Go , fetch me something : I'll break ope the gate .
We'll speak to them , and tonight I'll force The wine peep through their scars. , Come on , my Queen , There's sap in 't yet .
With his eyes full of anger .
Some innocents 'scape not the thunderbolt .
But yet , madam , I do not like "But yet." It does allay The good precedence .
But here comes Antony .
Let's hear it .
For this , be sure , tonight thou shalt have cramps , Side-stitches that shall pen thy breath up .
Most learned judge , a sentence !
If die , be brief , That our swift-winged souls may catch the king's , Or , like obedient subjects , follow him To his new kingdom of ne'er-changing night .
Ha , ha , ha !
Speak , my fair , and fairly , I pray thee .
Go .
I would not see 't .
Come , good fellow , put thine iron on .
The concavities of it is not sufficient , for , look you , th ' athversary , you may discuss unto the duke , look you , is digt himself four yard under the countermines .
He was not three leagues off when I left him .
Ere he take ship for France , and in Southampton .
I pray you , let me look upon the bond .
No more .
I'll to my charge .
Many a man his life hath sold But my outside to behold .
Thou seest we are not all alone unhappy .
Who intercepts my expedition ?
Tis fittest .
I stay here on my bond .
Let him alone .
You look wearily .
Crown him that , And then I grant we put a sting in him That at his will he may do danger with .
And therefore is Love said to be a child , Because in choice he is so oft beguiled .
Ay , if I be alive and your mind hold and your dinner worth the eating .
And aroint thee , witch , aroint thee !
Oh , couldst thou speak , That I might hear thee call great Caesar ass Unpolicied !
What is the matter , my lord ?
Still am I called. , Unhand me , gentlemen .
Was ever man so 'rayed ?
Spake you not these words plain : "Sirrah , knock me here , rap me here , knock me well , and knock me soundly" ?
I do beseech you , take it not amiss ; I can not , nor I will not , yield to you .
Hail .
It can not be .
And to sink in it , should you burthen love , Too great oppression for a tender thing .
Speak again .
Call Claudio and some other of my men .
Who else should be ?
We came crying hither .
I know not why he comes .
I will indeed no longer endure it , nor am I yet persuaded to put up in peace what already I have foolishly suffered .
You know not why we came to visit you , Thus out of season , threading dark-eyed night .
So that my speed to Mantua there was stayed .
I am as mad as he , If sad and merry madness equal be .
Rarely , rarely .
Thou villain , what sayest thou ?
Was never mother had so dear a loss .
I know the boy will well usurp the grace , Voice , gait , and action of a gentlewoman .
Did heaven look on , And would not take their part ?
I weigh it lightly , were it heavier .
Never , my lord .
Which dreams indeed are ambition , for the very substance of the ambitious is merely the shadow of a dream .
And then he drew a dial from his poke And , looking on it with lackluster eye , Says very wisely , "It is ten o'clock .
Am I not an inch of fortune better than she ?
O , pardon me for bringing these ill news , Since you did leave it for my office , sir .
It shall do well .
What proof shall I make of that ?
There , take it , Prince .
We wish your peace .
Where is thy husband now ?
Come hither , Catesby .
Methinks she should not use a long one for such a Pyramus .
Enjoy the honey-heavy dew of slumber .
But till that time Come not thou near me .
Do not believe That , from the sense of all civility , I thus would play and trifle with your reverence .
Sleeping and waking , O , defend me still !
Why , so he doth , when he delivers you From this earth's thralldom to the joys of heaven .
Lucius , awake .
I strike quickly , being moved .
A greater power than we can contradict Hath thwarted our intents .
Not a jot more , my lord .
Ay , but I know , What dost thou know ?
Tis known before .
Tis a good dullness , And give it way .
What , is the fellow mad ?
By my life , I do .
Help !
Please , let me stay .
On Thursday , sir ?
What speech , my good lord ?
I have known when there was no music with him but the drum and the fife , and now had he rather hear the tabor and the pipe .
Your cake there is warm within ; you stand here in the cold .
Shall we go send them dinners and fresh suits , And give their fasting horses provender , And after fight with them ?
Good , speak to th ' mariners .
Yet if thou say Antony lives , is well , Or friends with Caesar , or not captive to him , I'll set thee in a shower of gold and hail Rich pearls upon thee .
I'll plague him .
I shall not look upon his like again .
That's all .
For a little Follow , and do me service .
How now , Roderigo !
Out .
I do bite my thumb , sir .
He were no lion were not Romans hinds .
I am the son of Marcus Cato , ho !
These things are beyond all use , And I do fear them .
Woe , woe are we , sir , you may not live to wear All your true followers out .
Filth , thou liest !
A gentle riddance. , Draw the curtains , go. , Let all of his complexion choose me so .
Kind sister , thanks .
Why , he was met even now As mad as the vexed sea , singing aloud , Crowned with rank fumiter and furrow-weeds , With burdocks , hemlock , nettles , cuckoo-flowers , Darnel , and all the idle weeds that grow In our sustaining corn. , A century send forth .
And so am I revenged. , That would be scanned .
But as well ?
He always loved our sister most , and with what poor judgment he hath now cast her off appears too grossly .
Therefore then , thou gaudy gold , Hard food for Midas , I will none of thee .
Shall I keep your hogs and eat husks with them ?
So do I his .
As birds do , Mother .
Happy indeed , as we have spent the day .
All is the fear and nothing is the love , As little is the wisdom , where the flight So runs against all reason .
What say you , Bottom ?
I am sure no man hath any quarrel to me .
Alack , my lord , that fault is none of yours .
Lord Edmund spake not with your lord at home ?
Tarry , sweet Beatrice .
Oh , how mine eyes do loathe his visage now !
You know tomorrow is the wedding day .
Nay , it is true , or else I am a Turk .
Tis sweating labor To bear such idleness so near the heart As Cleopatra this .
Age can not wither her , nor custom stale Her infinite variety .
Can I bear that with patience , And not my husband's secrets ?
Emilia , run you to the citadel And tell my lord and lady what hath happed. , Will you go on afore ?
Or I do forget myself ?
What , art mad ?
Tis wonder that thy life and wits at once Had not concluded all. , He wakes .
We speak no treason , man .
I stand for judgment .
What say'st thou , noble heart ?
I fear he will .
Still did I tell him it was vile and bad .
Masters , play here , I will content your pains .
I have no words .
Sir , his chests and treasure He has not with him .
The messengers of Venice stays the meat .
Say boldly .
I am sorry for her , as I have just cause , being her uncle and her guardian .
Maud , Bridget , Marian , Ciceley , Gillian , Ginn !
O heavenly mingle !
See how beastly she doth court him !
Her waspish-headed son has broke his arrows , Swears he will shoot no more , but play with sparrows And be a boy right out .
What , girl , though gray Do something mingle with our younger brown , yet ha' we A brain that nourishes our nerves and can Get goal for goal of youth .
Leave you your power to draw , And I shall have no power to follow you .
This is nothing , Fool .
Nay , never lay thy hand upon thy sword .
That did I , my lord , and was accounted a good actor .
I commend my duty to your lordship .
Here , sir !
I have no power upon you .
Be clamorous , and leap all civil bounds , Rather than make unprofited return .
Come , sir , I am for you .
Your vessels and your spells provide , Your charms and everything beside .
You shall close prisoner rest Till that the nature of your fault be known To the Venetian state. , Come , bring him away .
I hope the king made peace with all of us ; And the compact is firm and true in me .
Too swift arrives as tardy as too slow .
And made your other love , Demetrius , Who even but now did spurn me with his foot , To call me goddess , nymph , divine , and rare , Precious , celestial ?
So the sins of my mother should be visited upon me .
That will never be .
False face must hide what the false heart doth know .
How canst thou thus for shame , Titania , Knowing I know thy love to Theseus ?
Cleopatra , Not what you have reserved nor what acknowledged Put we i' th' roll of conquest .
I wish you well , and so I take my leave .
Was he not companion with the riotous knights That tend upon my father ?
Is it e'en so ?
Would I were satisfied !
And in good time here the lieutenant comes. , Master Lieutenant , pray you , by your leave , How doth the prince and my young son of York ?
I drink to thee .
By mine honor I will , and when I break that oath , let me turn monster .
Hail .
It is impossible they bear it out .
Thy substance , valued at the highest rate , Can not amount unto a hundred marks ; Therefore by law thou art condemned to die .
I mean , sir , for his weapon .
Are not you he ?
Sir , most heedfully .
Thy daemon , that thy spirit which keeps thee , is Noble , courageous , high , unmatchable Where Caesar's is not .
Farewell , thou woeful welcomer of glory .
He is already named and gone to Scone To be invested .
Great happiness !
Tis so strange That , though the truth of it stands off as gross As black and white , my eye will scarcely see it .
If it be not for some purpose of import , Give 't me again .
It is the best horse of Europe .
Feed and regard him not .
He came too late .
Be not too late .
Woe , woe for England !
O sir , I do , and will repute you ever The patron of my life and liberty .
Swounds , show me what thou'lt do .
So I am , to let him live .
So , slave , hence !
I pray you , speak not .
I call them forth to credit her .
No doubt , my lord .
See better , Lear , and let me still remain The true blank of thine eye .
Tomorrow , and tomorrow , and tomorrow , Creeps in this petty pace from day to day To the last syllable of recorded time , And all our yesterdays have lighted fools The way to dusty death .
What is the course and drift of your compact ?
Oh , rarely base !
I have them ready .
And yesterday the bird of night did sit Even at noon-day upon the marketplace , Hooting and shrieking .
Where art thou , proud Demetrius ?
Now I change my mind , And partly credit things that do presage .
Worse and worse !
I'll none of it .
I this infer : That many things , having full reference To one consent , may work contrariously , As many arrows loosed several ways Come to one mark , as many ways meet in one town , As many fresh streams meet in one salt sea , As many lines close in the dial's center , So may a thousand actions , once afoot , End in one purpose , and be all well borne Without defeat .
Do all men kill the things they do not love ?
And yonder , Caesar .
You are pictures out of door , bells in your parlors , wild-cats in your kitchens , saints in your injuries , devils being offended , players in your housewifery , and housewives in your beds .
Here's such a coil .
Would you praise Caesar , say "Caesar." Go no further .
Two nights together had these gentlemen , Marcellus and Barnardo , on their watch , In the dead waste and middle of the night , Been thus encountered : a figure like your father , Armed at point exactly , cap-a-pie , Appears before them and with solemn march Goes slow and stately by them .
Oh , ay .
Stirred up by Dorset , Buckingham , and Morton , He makes for England , here to claim the crown .
What soldiers , patch ?
Adieu .
We will hear Caesar's will .
We shall be much unfurnished for this time .
If the matter of this paper be certain , you have mighty business in hand .
Awake , I say !
So good night unto you all .
I thought all for the best .
What , the chain ?
Only I say Things have been strangely borne .
Your plantain leaf is excellent for that .
You have among you many a purchased slave , Which , like your asses and your dogs and mules , You use in abject and in slavish parts Because you bought them .
But are not some whole that we must make sick ?
Are not these woods More free from peril than the envious court ?
Here I am Antony , Yet can not hold this visible shape , my knave .
At Sardis once , And this last night here in Philippi fields .
This cold night will turn us all to fools and madmen .
You might have saved me my pains to have taken it away yourself .
Ill rest betide the chamber where thou liest !
If our father carry authority with such dispositions as he bears , this last surrender of his will but offend us .
O , 'tis a parlous boy , Bold , quick , ingenious , forward , capable .
What , is there such a place ?
That's my noble master !
True .
Why , Belman is as good as he , my lord .
Yea , wherefore should she not ?
Ay , marry , must you .
Some comfort , Nurse .
To show an unfelt sorrow is an office Which the false man does easy .
I have been talking with a suitor here , A man that languishes in your displeasure .
I'll speak a prophecy ere I go .
The patch is kind enough , but a huge feeder , Snail-slow in profit , and he sleeps by day More than the wildcat .
I'll signify so much unto him straight .
Nothing , unless you render her again .
Farewell .
O noble judge !
So that by my foes , sir I profit in the knowledge of myself , and by my friends , I am abused .
Enobarbus ?
Nay , I have offered all , I have no more , And she can have no more than all I have .
I did not see him since .
May we be gone ?
But I with blowing the fire shall warm myself .
Be not lost So poorly in your thoughts .
Are they not now upon the western shore , Safe-conducting the rebels from their ships ?
Do so .
Pardon me , I pray you .
There's none else by .
Most like a gentleman .
Know you any , count ?
Excellent well .
What serious contemplation are you in ?
So the fool follows after .
You received no gold ?
I know you are my eldest brother , and in the gentle condition of blood you should so know me .
As he was fortunate , I rejoice at it .
My noble father , I do perceive here a divided duty .
Off , pluck off !
I thank thee , good Tubal .
Ay , and briefly .
If thou wilt lend this money , lend it not As to thy friends , for when did friendship take A breed for barren metal of his friend ?
The revenges we are bound to take upon your traitorous father are not fit for your beholding .
Nay , send in time !
Nature presently distilled Helen's cheek , but not her heart , Cleopatra's majesty , Atalanta's better part , Sad Lucretia's modesty .
Under what captain serve you ?
It curvets unseasonably .
The sun was not so true unto the day As he to me .
Truly then I fear you are damned both by father and mother .
I came hither to tell you ; and , circumstances shortened , for she has been too long a-talking of , the lady is disloyal .
Truly , shepherd , in respect of itself , it is a good life ; but in respect that it is a shepherd's life , it is naught .
Love wrought these miracles .
Unfought withal , but I will sell my dukedom To buy a slobb'ry and a dirty farm In that nook-shotten isle of Albion .
She is damned for it .
Hark !
If she live long , And in the end meet the old course of death , Women will all turn monsters .
You may go to the devil's dam !
Fare-well .
I pray thee , sing , and let me woo no more .
Then we are rid of Litio .
Moody ?
Then you do not love me ?
Sola !
If you choose that , then I am yours withal .
Hail !
Faith , niece , you tax Signor Benedick too much , but he'll be meet with you , I doubt it not .
Now shall you see the other .
And this way have you well expounded it .
Is 't true , is 't true ?
A pox of drowning thyself !
I find it still , when I have leave to sleep .
Bear with my weakness .
My worthy lord , Your noble friends do lack you .
In all these circumstances I'll instruct you .
Twas told me you were rough and coy and sullen , And now I find report a very liar .
Nothing but "low" and "little" ! , Why will you suffer her to flout me thus ?
At the duke's oak we meet .
Tis destiny unshunnable , like death .
You draw me , you hard-hearted adamant .
Sola , sola !
I'll rest .
Neither to you nor any one , having no witness to confirm my speech .
Therefore my son i ' th ' ooze is bedded , and I'll seek him deeper than e'er plummet sounded And with him there lie mudded .
Come , Kate , we'll to bed .
I think he would not wish himself anywhere but where he is .
A sister I bequeath you whom no brother Did ever love so dearly .
Gentleman , God save thee .
Is that true ?
Well , I will forget the condition of my estate to rejoice in yours .
You have no stomach , Signior .
I can tell you , but young Romeo will be older when you have found him than he was when you sought him .
Your Grace , we think , should soonest know his mind .
I will omit no opportunity That may convey my greetings , love , to thee .
I would fain prove so .
Oh , be sick , great greatness , And bid thy ceremony give thee cure !
At our synagogue , Tubal .
Farewell , sweet playfellow .
My strange and self-abuse Is the initiate fear that wants hard use .
For thy escape would teach me tyranny , To hang clogs on them. , I have done , my lord .
Then , world , thou hast a pair of chaps , no more , And throw between them all the food thou hast , They'll grind the one the other .
By my troth , I would not undertake her in this company .
My most dear lord !
Make us thy ministers of chastisement , That we may praise thee in the victory !
And I do know by this they stay for me In Pompey's porch .
His daughters seek his death .
Sir , grieve not you .
Till which encounter It is my business too .
What news from her ?
Wilt thou rest damned ?
Hark thee , Dardanius .
But swords I smile at , weapons laugh to scorn , Brandished by man that's of a woman born .
For , I am sure , you have your hands full all In this so sudden business .
What simple thief brags of his own attaint ?
My purposes do draw me much about .
Cassio shall have my place .
A good epithet !
Villain , I say , knock me at this gate And rap me well , or I'll knock your knave's pate .
Is 't frailty that thus errs ?
What , man , there are ways to recover the general again .
Take up the sword again , or take up me .
Since he hath got the jewel that I loved , And that which you did swear to keep for me , I will become as liberal as you .
That eye that told you so looked but asquint .
It is the bright day that brings forth the adder And that craves wary walking .
This will put them out of fear .
Now my spirit is going .
Therefore be patient .
For with throwing thus my head , Dogs leap the hatch , and all are fled .
Now must the world point at poor Katherine And say , "Lo , there is mad Petruchio's wife , If it would please him come and marry her ! " Upon my life , Petruchio means but well , Whatever fortune stays him from his word : Though he be blunt , I know him passing wise ; Though he be merry , yet withal he's honest .
But though my cates be mean , take them in good part .
Then forth , dear countrymen .
We waste our lights in vain , like lights by day .
Nor heaven nor earth have been at peace tonight .
An I had been a man of any occupation , if I would not have taken him at a word , I would I might go to hell among the rogues .
Ay , and a bold one , that dare look on that Which might appall the devil .
Would the night were come !
It did come to his hands , and commands shall be executed .
I will do so .
But for your husband , He is noble , wise , judicious , and best knows The fits o ' th ' season .
No .
Troth , sir , I can yield you none without words , and words are grown so false , I am loath to prove reason with them .
I should be wise , for honesty's a fool And loses that it works for .
My lord ?
Welcome , Publius .
Maybe the letter moved him , For , as I think , they do command him home , Deputing Cassio in his government .
I am old and foolish .
Thy death and fortunes bid thy followers fly .
O , my lord , You said that idle weeds are fast in growth .
Farewell , kind lord .
Be eloquent in my behalf to her .
Here , sir !
Come , let us to the banquet .
Thy voice is thunder , but thy looks are humble .
Tush , thou art deceived .
Tell the clock there .
Is 't so saucy ?
I'll pheeze you , in faith .
Jailer , look to him .
I will be bitter with him and passing short .
What trumpet's that ?
Would it not grieve a woman to be overmastered with a piece of valiant dust ?
So much for praising myself , who , I myself will bear witness , is praiseworthy .
Scant not my cups , and make as much of me As when mine empire was your fellow too , And suffered my command .
And Trinculo is reeling ripe .
Sola !
What did you mean by that same handkerchief you gave me even now ?
It begins "Hold thy peace." I shall never begin if I hold my peace .
For his thoughts , Would they were blanks , rather than fill'd with me .
Hadst thou done so , The kings that have revolted , and the soldier That has this morning left thee , would have still Followed thy heels .
Therefore wast thou Deservedly confined into this rock , Who hadst deserved more than a prison .
And I trow this is his house .
Go a little before .
Bring me to Octavius .
And I must Rid all the sea of pirates , then , to send Measures of wheat to Rome .
Look whe'e he has not turned his color and has tears in 's eyes. , Prithee , no more .
And here stands all your state : Either be gone before the watch be set , Or by the break of day disguised from hence .
Tybalt , the kinsman to old Capulet , Hath sent a letter to his father's house .
I am a gentleman of blood and breeding , And from some knowledge and assurance offer This office to you .
Who hath measured the ground ?
Well , stand aside. , 'Fore God , they are both in a ale .
Where is my lord ?
If he do , sure he can not weep 't back again .
There sleeps Titania sometime of the night , Lulled in these flowers with dances and delight .
I know no answer .
I will not change my horse with any that treads but on four pasterns .
Let me stand here till thou remember it .
If thou speak'st false , Upon the next tree shall thou hang alive Till famine cling thee .
O villain !
You take your pennyworths now .
Bring me no more reports .
What think you of the Scottish lord , his neighbor ?
And be not easily won to our requests .
We have cause to be glad that matters are so well digested .
Some oracle Must rectify our knowledge .
What's the matter ?
He is not very tall , yet for his years he's tall .
Stay , Tybalt , stay !
I like you lads .
Who's there ?
O wherefore , Nature , didst thou lions frame ?
Good morrow , masters .
Upon my honor , Then came each actor on his ass ,
Is all things ready for the royal time ?
Flatterers ? , Now , Brutus , thank yourself .
You peasant swain !
I hear some noise within .
His indignation derives itself out of a very competent injury .
Hast thou met with him ?
You may think perchance that I think you are in love .
I find here that Don Pedro hath bestowed much honor on a young Florentine called Claudio .
Thou liest , thou shag-haired villain !
Are you of good or evil ?
He thinks , being twenty times of better fortune , He is twenty men to one .
But wherefore did you so much tempt the heavens ?
Most certain .
I come to thee for charitable license , That we may wander o'er this bloody field To book our dead and then to bury them ; To sort our nobles from our common men , For many of our princes , woe the while ! , Lie drowned and soaked in mercenary blood .
Woe to the land that's governed by a child .
And second father This lady makes him to me .
Nay , he will answer the letter's master , how he dares , being dared .
And , gentle master , I received no gold .
I do fear , the people Choose Caesar for their king .
There thou mayst brain him , Having first seized his books ; or with a log Batter his skull ; or paunch him with a stake ; Or cut his weasand with thy knife .
O most pernicious woman !
Keep me in temper .
Nay , I'll come .
And may , but how ?
What man is that ?
Come , go we to the king .
Keep close , I thee command .
I would speak with Clarence , and I came hither on my legs .
In cunning I must draw my sword upon you .
Saw you him today ?
Who dead ?
My suit to her Is that she will to virtuous Desdemona Procure me some access .
Hope I may choose , sir .
Who governs here ?
I wrote to you When rioting in Alexandria .
And friends with Caesar .
Caesar , I shall .
But you , O you , So perfect and so peerless , are created Of every creature's best .
He'll never yield to that .
I will talk further with you .
Speak to him .
He shall enlarge him .
Come with my lady hither .
For often , with a solemn earnestness , More than indeed belonged to such a trifle , He begged of me to steal it .
A grandam's name is little less in love Than is the doting title of a mother .
Your gentleness shall force More than your force move us to gentleness .
But who comes here ?
Kent banished thus ?
God and his angels guard your sacred throne And make you long become it .
An I may hide my face , let me play Thisbe too !
And I will sing it in the latter end of a play before the duke .
He hath slept long .
I have not 'scaped drowning to be afeard now of your four legs .
And take good note What Caesar doth , what suitors press to him .
O time's extremity , Hast thou so crack'd and splitted my poor tongue In seven short years that here my only son Knows not my feeble key of untuned cares ?
Here comes another of the tribe .
Why have you stol'n upon us thus ?
I am changed .
Fare you well .
I have told thee often , and I re-tell thee again and again , I hate the Moor .
Thou know'st not gold's effect .
Captain Macmorris , when there is more better opportunity to be required , look you , I will be so bold as to tell you I know the disciplines of war , and there is an end .
Hear my excuse .
Master , master !
No more .
I'll fetch them , sir .
Speak , speak !
I'll to the friar to know his remedy .
I will praise any man that will praise me , though it can not be denied what I have done by land .
What mercy can you render him , Antonio ?
All take hands .
Lepidus flatters both , Of both is flattered , but he neither loves , Nor either cares for him .
Ay , but not rough enough .
I can not be so answer'd .
Full of vexation come I with complaint Against my child , my daughter Hermia. , Stand forth , Demetrius. , My noble lord , This man hath my consent to marry her. , Stand forth , Lysander. , And my gracious duke , This man hath bewitched the bosom of my child. , Thou , thou , Lysander , thou hast given her rhymes , And interchanged love tokens with my child .
Gramercy !
But if you do refuse to marry me , You'll give yourself to this most faithful shepherd ?
Offended us you have not , but the king .
Then , tell me , Who's the next heir of Naples ?
Oh , behold , The riches of the ship is come on shore !
Sir , here's the door .
Our hour Is fully out .
Why , thou say'st true .
Nay , an you will not , sir , I'll take my heels .
The time is come .
And so , without more circumstance at all , I hold it fit that we shake hands and part .
Ah , Luciana , did he tempt thee so ?
Either my eyesight fails , or thou look'st pale .
That's my fear .
I know it is the moon .
Thy reason , dear venom , give thy reason .
Then is he more beholding to you than I .
Why do you infect yourself with them ?
What work is here , Charmian ?
Is this certain ?
It is meat and drink to me to see a clown .
Without contradiction I have heard that .
Our son shall win .
I told you , sir , they were red-hot with drinking , So full of valor that they smote the air For breathing in their faces , beat the ground For kissing of their feet , yet always bending Towards their project .
Thy gown ?
O , give me leave .
Die and be damned , and It is well .
You cloudy princes and heart-sorrowing peers That bear this heavy mutual load of moan , Now cheer each other in each other's love .
We'll send Mark Antony to the senate house , And he shall say you are not well today .
Here , sirrah Grumio .
But that , forsooth , the bouncing Amazon , Your buskined mistress and your warrior love , To Theseus must be wedded , and you come To give their bed joy and prosperity .
Rise , and lend thine ear .
My lord , I warrant you we will play our part As he shall think by our true diligence He is no less than what we say he is .
Was not Count John here at supper ?
What man is that ?
Of all the wonders that I yet have heard , It seems to me most strange that men should fear , Seeing that death , a necessary end , Will come when it will come .
Observe his construction of it .
I pray thee , let us go and find him out And quicken his embraced heaviness With some delight or other .
Fear comes upon me .
Tut , there's life in 't , man .
Farewell !
Oh , the heavens !
Their papers is more lawful .
Sir , March is wasted fifteen days .
Spirit , We must prepare to meet with Caliban .
When he is best he is a little worse than a man , and when he is worst he is little better than a beast .
That I have labored With all my wits , my pains , and strong endeavors , To bring your most imperial Majesties Unto this bar and royal interview , Your mightiness on both parts best can witness .
I thank you .
Prepare you , generals .
Meet presently at the palace .
Those that will hear me speak , let 'em stay here .
It is no boast , being asked , to say we are .
Then swore he that he was a stranger here .
Methoughts that I had broken from the Tower And was embarked to cross to Burgundy , And in my company my brother Gloucester , Who from my cabin tempted me to walk Upon the hatches .
He .
I may do that I shall be sorry for .
Therefore let Benedick , like covered fire , Consume away in sighs , waste inwardly .
That thing you speak of , I took it for a man .
I would she had bestowed this dotage on me .
At last I left them I ' th ' filthy-mantled pool beyond your cell , There dancing up to th ' chins , that the foul lake O'erstunk their feet .
Convey her to my tent .
Alas the day !
Go , be gone .
Are there no stones in heaven But what serve for the thunder ? , Precious villain !
Why , how now , monsieur ?
These late eclipses in the sun and moon portend no good to us .
Go you and tell my daughter I would speak with her .
Whither are they vanished ?
I am now in great haste , as it may appear unto you .
Yes indeed .
That's good .
Pray thee , marry us .
You are a councilor .
Where is the Master , Boatswain ?
Goes the king hence today ?
Look where they come .
As I am Egypt's queen , Thou blushest , Antony , and that blood of thine Is Caesar's homager .
Then would to Heaven that I had never seen 't !
O Antony , beg not your death of us .
Thus high , by thy advice And thy assistance is King Richard seated .
There lies your way , due west .
A friend .
My lord , I think I saw him yesternight .
Those uncles which you want were dangerous .
Give me leave , Caesar .
I have some business .
Faith , I saw it not , but I felt it hot in her breath .
Gertrude , do not drink .
Sir ?
Of all the days i ' the year , I came to 't that day that our last King Hamlet overcame Fortinbras .
Beat ,
So do I , my lord .
I'll hold my mind were she an Ethiope .
Do not you wear your dagger in your cap that day , lest he knock that about yours .
Your Emperor Continues still a Jove .
Fare you well , sir .
Here is yet a postscript .
I could tell you more news too .
Cupid is a knavish lad Thus to make poor females mad .
Turn thy complexion there , Patience , thou young and rose-lipped cherubin , , Ay , there , look grim as hell !
Therefore go .
This is my treasurer .
Iago keeps his word .
Nay , but how dearly he adores Mark Antony !
You are full of pretty answers .
But tell not me .
What if this mixture do not work at all ?
Ish a villain and a basterd and a knave and a rascal .
Where is he ?
Pray you , let's sit together .
Now I am alone .
Can virtue hide itself ?
His present and your pains we thank you for .
All's well , sweeting , Come away to bed. , Myself will be your surgeon .
No cock of mine .
Amen !
Thine , Claudio , thine , I say .
Call forth Nathaniel , Joseph , Nicholas , Philip , Walter , Sugarsop , and the rest .
Out of my sight ! , Be not offended , dear Cesario. , Rudesby , be gone !
At this hour Lie at my mercy all mine enemies .
And therefore as a stranger give it welcome .
What's this ?
Thither will I invite the duke and all's contented followers .
The leisure and the fearful time Cuts off the ceremonious vows of love And ample interchange of sweet discourse , Which so-long-sundered friends should dwell upon .
You nimble lightnings , dart your blinding flames Into her scornful eyes !
Name them .
For that goes hard .
And you all know , security Is mortals ' chiefest enemy .
I owe you none till I receive the chain .
Ay , I thank God , my father , and yourself .
Give me your hand , And let me all your fortunes understand .
What sayst thou ?
Catesby .
Come on , Nerissa , I have work in hand That you yet know not of .
I'll tell thee , Aliena , I can not be out of the sight of Orlando .
Oh , she was heavenly true !
Better be with the dead , Whom we , to gain our peace , have sent to peace , Than on the torture of the mind to lie In restless ecstasy .
And so the lion vanished .
Nay , an thou canst not smile as the wind sits , thou'lt catch cold shortly .
They are free men , but I am banished .
Why , this was molded on a porringer !
Oh , by no means .
Meantime , have patience .
I do beseech you , sir , trouble yourself no further .
You have heard much .
Then there's hope a great man's memory may outlive his life half a year .
But now , my lord , what say you to my suit ?
She was false as water .
Think you of a worse title , and I will fit her to it .
Go , good partner , go , get you to Francis Seacole .
Yea , or to paint himself ?
He shall have nothing but the penalty .
I will say nothing .
But I can tell why a snail has a house .
Let him alone , for I remember now How he's employed .
There's beggary in the love that can be reckoned .
If I had thee in Lipsbury pinfold , I would make thee care for me .
Believe not so .
Your castle is surprised , your wife and babes Savagely slaughtered .
Speak .
You told me so .
Farewell content !
The king and prince at prayers .
Conception is a blessing , but , as your daughter may conceive , Friend , look to 't .
Your honor is most welcome .
Do you amend it then .
It is something of my negligence , nothing of my purpose .
We shall , my liege .
I think I had .
That lord that counseled thee To give away thy land , Come place him here by me .
With one fool's head I came to woo , But I go away with two. , Sweet , adieu .
Bonos dies , Sir Toby .
Oh , a good wish upon you .
Give first admittance to th ' ambassadors .
Or I will live Or bathe my dying honor in the blood Shall make it live again .
Well demanded , wench .
Let me see his face .
The rest aloof are the Dardanian wives , With bleared visages come forth to view The issue of th ' exploit. , Go , Hercules !
Why , ay .
I now perceive it was not altogether your brother's evil disposition made him seek his death , but a provoking merit set awork by a reprovable badness in himself .
O my good lord , Believe not all , or , if you must believe , Stomach not all .
Who was last with them ?
We'll give them present audience .
Now they believe it and withal whet me To be revenged on Rivers , Dorset , Grey ; But then I sigh and , with a piece of scripture , Tell them that God bids us do good for evil ; And thus I clothe my naked villainy With odd old ends stolen out of Holy Writ , And seem a saint when most I play the devil .
Here , here will I remain With worms that are thy chamber maids .
There's matter in 't indeed , if he be angry .
What drink'st thou oft , instead of homage sweet , But poisoned flattery ?
My dear master , My captain , and my emperor , let me say , Before I strike this bloody stroke , farewell .
Oh , do not wish one more !
He speaks to me. , I am your master , Dromio .
There , take you that , sir knave .
Yonder comes my master , your brother .
Or shall we on without apology ?
Caesar speaks .
But all the charms of love , Salt Cleopatra , soften thy wanned lip !
Triple-turned whore !
No , not an oath .
So be gone .
Tis vile , unless it may be quaintly ordered , And better in my mind not undertook .
For two , and sound ones too .
What ish my nation ?
I cross me for a sinner .
But there is never a fair woman has a true face .
The best ?
If till the expiration of your month , You will return and sojourn with my sister , Dismissing half your train , come then to me .
Back do I toss these treasons to thy head , With the hell-hated lie o'erwhelm thy heart ,
And he's gone .
Yes , Shylock , I will seal unto this bond .
But what say you to Thursday ?
I'll grow a talker for this gear .
Here do you keep a hundred knights and squires , Men so disordered , so debauched and bold That this our court , infected with their manners , Shows like a riotous inn .
Sir , my good friend , I'll change that name with you .
Tis passing good .
My Lord , Ay , what's o'clock ?
He shall see none to fear .
Your sister is the better soldier .
Most gracious Duke , To my unfolding lend your prosperous ear And let me find a charter in your voice , T ' assist my simpleness .
Ho , ho , ho !
Pray , chuck , come hither .
Here's the smell of the blood still .
The more I hate , the more he follows me .
When I came back , For this was brief , I found them close together At blow and thrust , even as again they were When you yourself did part them .
For I am sure mine nails Are stronger than mine eyes .
For , look you , how cheerfully my mother looks , and my father died within these two hours .
Nay , by 'r Lady , that I think he can not .
That we should , with joy , pleasance revel and applause , transform ourselves into beasts !
Sola , sola !
is 't not perfect conscience To quit him with this arm ?
Come , help to bear thy master .
O me !
The trumpery in my house , go bring it hither For stale to catch these thieves .
Is Banquo gone from court ?
You have lost no reputation at all unless you repute yourself such a loser .
If she should make tender of her love , 'tis very possible he'll scorn it , for the man , as you know all , hath a contemptible spirit .
My love is thine to teach .
Aha !
My affections Are then most humble .
Why , a horse .
O treachery !
Can you inquire him out and be edified by report ?
What if it come to thee again ?
But upon the fairest boughs , Or at every sentence end , Will I "Rosalinda" write , Teaching all that read to know The quintessence of every sprite Heaven would in little show .
You may as well say , that's a valiant flea that dare eat his breakfast on the lip of a lion .
O Lord , Lord , it is a hard matter for friends to meet , but mountains may be removed with earthquakes and so encounter .
It is shaped , sir , like itself , and it is as broad as it hath breadth .
I have been worth the whistle .
Take them away .
I hope you will consider what is spoke Comes from my love .
It is no matter how witty , so it be eloquent and full of invention .
She confesses it .
Mine shall be spent When theirs are dry , for Romeo's banishment .
Believe me for mine honor , and have respect to mine honor that you may believe .
Fair Beatrice , I thank you for your pains .
Good time of day unto my gracious lord .
Minion , your dear lies dead , And your unblest fate hies .
Be these the wretches that we played at dice for ?
Cassius , go you into the other street And part the numbers .
I have a mind to strike thee ere thou speak'st .
In Caesar's fleet Are those that often have 'gainst Pompey fought .
Why might not you , my lord , receive attendance From those that she calls servants , or from mine ?
It is some meteor that the sun exhales To be to thee this night a torchbearer , And light thee on thy way to Mantua .
Trust not Trebonius .
His daughter is to be brought by you to the supper .
Am I myself ?
From France there comes a power Into this scattered kingdom , who already , Wise in our negligence , have secret feet In some of our best ports and are at point To show their open banner .
Oh peace , Prince Dauphin !
Ay , so I thought .
Good !
Go thither , and with unattainted eye Compare her face with some that I shall show , And I will make thee think thy swan a crow .
From the dread summit of this chalky bourn .
Most monstrous , oh !
Those that were your father's enemies Have steeped their galls in honey , and do serve you With hearts create of duty and of zeal .
Oh , the world hath not a sweeter creature , she might lie by an emperor's side and command him tasks .
Leave me , I say .
Let us not break with him , For he will never follow anything That other men begin .
My dear'st sister !
The throng that follows Caesar at the heels , Of senators , of praetors , common suitors , Will crowd a feeble man almost to death .
For my part , I am so attired in wonder I know not what to say .
Trouble yourselves no further .
Come forth .
Be by , good madam , when we do awake him .
If then they chanced to slack you , We could control them .
Thy father !
Neither rhyme nor reason can express how much .
Would you had never seen him !
I often came where I did hear of her , but can not find her .
I will o'ertake thee , Cleopatra , and Weep for my pardon .
O , they did urge it still unto the king .
Oh , falsely , falsely murdered !
Out , you baggage !
Where may we set our horses ?
He is welcome too .
To vail the title , as her mother doth .
Madam , your mother craves a word with you .
Go , one of you , find out the forester .
Fie upon 't , foh !
Marry , this is miching
I shall take it , sir .
This sword but shown to Caesar , with this tidings , Shall enter me with him .
The moon is down .
Ay , 'twas he that told me on her first .
Madam , not yet .
He has been yonder i ' the sun practising behavior to his own shadow this half hour .
Urge the necessity and state of times , And be not peevish found in great designs .
The herb I showed thee once .
My name is Thidias .
He did in some sort , indeed , handle women , but then he was rheumatic , and talked of the Whore of Babylon .
Thy Edward he is dead , that killed my Edward , Thy other Edward dead , to quit my Edward ; Young York , he is but boot , because both they Matched not the high perfection of my loss .
But no more sights ! , Where are these gentlemen ?
There's not , I think , a subject That sits in heart-grief and uneasiness Under the sweet shade of your government .
Yea , and text underneath : "Here dwells Benedick the married man" ?
For both , my lord .
Only be patient till we have appeased The multitude , beside themselves with fear , And then we will deliver you the cause , Why I , that did love Caesar when I struck him , Have thus proceeded .
My lord , what is your will ?
I'll never care what wickedness I do , If this man come to good .
I'll not be forsworn .
I do but keep the peace .
Murder !
Come , come away .
Not a hair perished .
A poor unfortunate beggar .
Tis time to look about .
Who is conductor of his people ?
I have known when he would have walked ten mile afoot to see a good armor , and now will he lie ten nights awake carving the fashion of a new doublet .
Be it so .
For murder , though it have no tongue , will speak With most miraculous organ .
So do not I .
These things to hear Would Desdemona seriously incline .
That will I , for I must bear answer back How you excuse my brother , Rosalind .
The sweet and bitter fool Will presently appear , The one in motley here , The other found out there .
Tears seven times salt , Burn out the sense and virtue of mine eye !
Till I shall see you in your soldiers' dress , Which will become you both , farewell .
Tis most convenient .
Ay , so I think .
Is not that neighborly ?
This morning are they fled away and gone , And in their steads do ravens , crows , and kites Fly o'er our heads and downward look on us As we were sickly prey .
The princes both make high account of you , I know they do , and I have well deserved it .
I pray you .
Youngling , thou canst not love so dear as I. Graybeard , thy love doth freeze .
No matter , since They have left their viands behind , for we have stomachs .
Antonio , I am married to a wife Which is as dear to me as life itself .
Now , my dearest Queen , Pray you , stand farther from me .
I serve the king , On whose employment I was sent to you .
Let me be ta'en .
Art thou my son ?
Hast thou drunk well ?
Be patient , for you shall remain with us .
Canst thou remember A time before we came unto this cell ?
What are you ?
And do it with all thy heart .
Hear me , Queen : The strong necessity of time commands Our services awhile , but my full heart Remains in use with you .
It is , my lord .
Oh , that I were a fool !
And these few precepts in thy memory Look thou character .
How goes it with my brave Mark Antony ?
I saw him not .
Fabian can scarce hold him yonder .
An I do not , Come , let's see the event .
Lucentio is your name .
That's he that was Othello .
Why , therefore fire , for I have caught extreme cold .
O heaven , O earth , bear witness to this sound And crown what I profess with kind event
Who chooseth me shall get as much as he deserves." And well said too , for who shall go about To cozen fortune and be honorable Without the stamp of merit ?
She's dead , she's dead , she's dead !
Give thy thoughts no tongue , Nor any unproportioned thought his act .
It is very true .
Where be thy tenants and thy followers ?
Hortensio , to what end are all these words ?
A devil , a born devil on whose nature Nurture can never stick , on whom my pains , Humanely taken , all , all lost , quite lost .
I will not disclose 'em .
I'll set a bourn how far to be beloved .
Call thyself "sister , " sweet , for I am thee .
I have a daughter , sir , called Katherina .
Troth , my lord , I have played the part of Lady Fame .
Tis a brave army , and full of purpose .
He's almost slain , and Roderigo dead .
Vouchsafe , defused infection of a man , Of these known evils but to give me leave By circumstance to curse thy cursed self .
Marry , 'tis enough .
Since thou dost give me pains , Let me remember thee what thou hast promised , Which is not yet performed me .
Confusion's cure lives not In these confusions .
It were pity to cast them away for nothing , though between them and a great cause they should be esteemed nothing .
How goes the world , sir , now ?
What a blunt fellow is this grown to be !
I can not bid you bid my daughter live , That were impossible , but , I pray you both , Possess the people in Messina here How innocent she died .
Indeed , sweet love , I was coming to your house .
What's your name , friend ?
Horns ?
Killing swine .
Call him in .
A friend .
Good signors both , when shall we laugh ?
Some light-foot friend post to the duke of Norfolk , Ratcliffe , thyself , or Catesby .
A crow without feather ?
Now , were not I a little pot and soon hot , my very lips might freeze to my teeth , my tongue to the roof of my mouth , my heart in my belly , ere I should come by a fire to thaw me .
As well as I can , madam .
It was two ere I left him , and now the clock strikes one .
The last she spake Was "Antony , most noble Antony ! " Then in the midst a tearing groan did break The name of Antony .
Oh , I am out of breath in this fond chase .
To suckle fools and chronicle small beer .
I will not till I please .
My lord of Gloucester hath conveyed him hence .
Come by and by to my chamber .
For , hark you , Tybalt being slain so late , It may be thought we held him carelessly , Being our kinsman , if we revel much .
What's his offense ?
Speak you so gently ?
Nor will not .
He smiled and said "The better for our purpose." He was in the right , and so indeed it is .
He says his name's Poor Tom .
And what hope is that , I pray thee ?
Take comfort .
I can not believe that in her .
Have you no modesty , no maiden shame , No touch of bashfulness ?
But is there any else longs to see this broken music in his sides ?
They have dispatched with Pompey ; he is gone .
Now Edmund , where's the villain ?
I am a fellow o ' th ' strangest mind i ' th ' world .
What might you think ?
What is here ?
You shall hear me .
Then , God grant me too Thou mayst be damned for that wicked deed .
What means this shouting ?
How came you to this ?
Lo , here upon thy cheek the stain doth sit Of an old tear that is not washed off yet .
I am afraid He will chastise me .
Have you no more to say ?
Ye say honestly .
He is ready at the door .
Write down "Master Gentleman Conrade." , Masters , do you serve God ?
Here is the place , my lord .
It is a high-wrought flood .
Tis most true , And he beseeched me to entreat your Majesties To hear and see the matter .
They must take it in sense that feel it .
His eyes are humbler than they used to be .
O no , my reasons are too deep and dead , Too deep and dead , poor infants , in their graves .
I shall remember .
These are portents , but yet I hope , I hope They do not point on me .
You shall Have letters from me to some friends that will Sweep your way for you .
Tis well thou art not fish .
Well have you heard , but something hard of hearing .
Art thou gone so , love , lord ?
Go after her .
Fight valiantly today .
Come one more .
What dogs are these !
I like it not .
Nathaniel's coat , sir , was not fully made , And Gabriel's pumps were all unpinked i ' th ' heel .
It must be shortly known to him from England What is the issue of the business there .
Will you two help to hasten them ?
No , my good lord .
I will follow you .
I'll fight till from my bones my flesh be hacked .
For what offence ?
It were an honest action to say So to the Moor .
Is not this man jealous ?
If I may trust the flattering truth of sleep , My dreams presage some joyful news at hand .
What is it , my good friends ?
Master , I am here entered in bond for you .
And therefore , since I can not prove a lover To entertain these fair well-spoken days , I am determined to prove a villain And hate the idle pleasures of these days .
I will leave you now to your gossip-like humor .
Is that the meaning of "accost" ?
You will be schoolmaster And undertake the teaching of the maid : That's your device .
Father , what news ?
No woman's heart So big , to hold so much .
How , in one house , Should many people under two commands Hold amity ?
Good Norfolk , hie thee to thy charge .
You shall have leave .
I have not heard the clock .
I go , my lord .
I have not seen such a firago .
I'll pluck thee berries .
If his fitness speaks , mine is ready , now or whensoever , provided I be so able as now .
He lies to th ' heart .
This is the man .
Pass .
My books and instruments shall be my company , On them to look and practice by myself .
We'll teach you to drink deep ere you depart .
If not , when you have stomachs .
Laugh to scorn The power of man , for none of woman born Shall harm Macbeth .
Ha , Portia ?
Count Claudio ?
To save her life , I'll say she is not so .
how , I pray ?
Dismiss me ?
Not th' imperious show Of the full-fortuned Caesar ever shall Be brooched with me .
Patience , good sir .
Tis done by me , and ends in "Margaret." Thus have you breathed your curse against yourself .
I doubt not of his temperance .
Coming from Sardis , on our former ensign Two mighty eagles fell , and there they perched , Gorging and feeding from our soldiers ' hands , Who to Philippi here consorted us .
They say this town is full of cozenage , As nimble jugglers that deceive the eye , Dark-working sorcerers that change the mind , Soul-killing witches that deform the body , Disguised cheaters , prating mountebanks , And many suchlike liberties of sin .
I must tell you then .
What impossible matter will he make easy next ?
Come , mistress Kate , I'll bear you company .
Where is the number of our English dead ?
Hie therefore , Robin , overcast the night .
I had rather be any kind o ' thing than a fool .
Hoyday , a riddle !
Men should be what they seem , Or those that be not , would they might seem none !
Here thought they to have done Some wanton charm upon this man and maid , Whose vows are that no bed-right shall be paid Till Hymen's torch be lighted , but in vain .
Look how thy servants do attend on thee , Each in his office ready at thy beck .
Look , he wears cruel garters .
Ha !
This is a dear manikin to you , Sir Toby .
Cesario is your servant's name , fair princess .
My gracious sovereign .
But , Lepidus , go you to Caesar's house .
I did her wrong , Canst tell how an oyster makes his shell ?
Madam !
I did send To you for gold to pay my legions , Which you denied me .
Who can impress the forest , bid the tree Unfix his earthbound root ?
You think none but your sheets are privy to your wishes .
Tis death for anyone in Mantua To come to Padua .
Nay , if our wits run the wild-goose chase , I am done , for thou hast more of the wild-goose in one of thy wits than , I am sure , I have in my whole five .
Confess ! , Handkerchief ! , Oh , devil ! , Work on , My medicine , work !
Good morrow , Catesby .
He that knows better how to tame a shrew , Now let him speak ; 'tis charity to show .
Ay , two hours together .
It lies in you .
What shall we hear of this ?
If I could add a lie unto a fault I would deny it .

You are welcome , sir , to Cyprus .
Come hither , fellow .
My masters , are you mad ?

It must appear in other ways than words , Therefore I scant this breathing courtesy .

Now , for I know the Breton Richmond aims At young Elizabeth , my brother's daughter , And by that knot looks proudly on the crown , To her go I , a jolly thriving wooer .
And let the wise man fly .
Why , Fool ?
For our bad neighbor makes us early stirrers , Which is both healthful and good husbandry .
Friends to this ground .

No .
I prithee , Strato , stay thou by thy lord .
No , indeed are they not .
Stop her there !
Let him be Caesar !
Very brief , and to exceeding good sense , less .
Get thee a wife , get thee a wife .
I gave you all , And in good time you gave it .
My salad days , When I was green in judgment , cold in blood , To say as I said then .
Cicero one ?
You shall not find , Though you be therein curious , the least cause For what you seem to fear .
He will not say so .
Would I might never O'ertake pursued success , but I do feel , By the rebound of yours , a grief that smites My very heart at root .
I care not for my spirits , if my legs were not weary .
The juice of it on sleeping eyelids laid Will make or man or woman madly dote Upon the next live creature that it sees .
Call the slave again .
Thy love ?
Pindarus , Bid our commanders lead their charges off A little from this ground .
That she was false to wedlock ?
The Lord Grandpre .
Foolish wench , To th ' most of men this is a Caliban And they to him are angels .
Only I yield to die .
Wrong I mine enemies ?
The knave counterfeits well .
Ratcliffe , about the mid of night come to my tent And help to arm me .
Remember me." I have sworn 't .
Down with the Capulets !
For then I'll marry Warwick's youngest daughter .
We should have met you By sea and land , supplying every stage With an augmented greeting .
Hover about her ; say that right for right Hath dimmed your infant morn to aged night .
The former Hero !
Your servants tend .
All myself ?
Till that , I'll view the manners of the town , Peruse the traders , gaze upon the buildings , And then return and sleep within mine inn , For with long travel I am stiff and weary .
Go to the gate .
In bed asleep while they do dream things true .
Since he went into France , I have been in continual practice .
What , wilt thou hear some music , my sweet love ?
Our preparation stands In expectation of them .
Disdain and scorn ride sparkling in her eyes , Misprizing what they look on , and her wit Values itself so highly that to her All matter else seems weak .
Whither ?
It is impossible you should see this , Were they as prime as goats , as hot as monkeys , As salt as wolves in pride , and fools as gross As ignorance made drunk .
Ha , it may be I go under that title because I am merry .
Pray heavens he be , For I have served him , and the man commands Like a full soldier .
Hold you still .
The day is yours .
I am pale , Charmian .
On thy love , I charge thee .
What a foolish duty call you this ?
Where , my lord ?
Tis said , man , and farewell .
Not till you have slept .
Oh , then belike she was old and gentle , and you rode , like a kern of Ireland , your French hose off and in your straight strossers .
I go , my lord .
I know that , but I would have thee hence and here again .
If he say so , may his pernicious soul Rot half a grain a day !
Tomorrow We'll hear ourselves again .
Marry , sir , by a rule as plain as the plain bald pate of Father Time himself .
Thanks , Rosencrantz and gentle Guildenstern .
Why , she was dead ere thou wast born .
I swear 'tis better to be much abused Than but to know 't a little .
O , teach me how you look and with what art You sway the motion of Demetrius ' heart .
It would be spoke to .
Nay , if an oily palm be not a fruitful prognostication , I can not scratch mine ear. , Prithee , tell her but a workaday fortune .
I know her by her gait .
Would all were well , but that will never be .
I , for my part , knew the tailor that made the wings she flew withal .
For certainly thou art so near the gulf Thou needs must be englutted .
Fool , I'll requite it in the highest degree .
Thou drunken slave , I sent thee for a rope And told thee to what purpose and what end .
What's her name ?
Do not think , gentlemen , I am drunk .
No wonder , sir , But certainly a maid .
What , rouse thee , man !
The letters that he speaks of May be my friends .
And leave out thee ?
Well-a-day that you were , sir .
There is no power in Venice Can alter a decree established .
Ah , this thou shouldst have done And not have spoke on 't !
I shall do well .
Prithee , put up .
No , not for Venice .
The heavens themselves blaze forth the death of princes .
Whilst you were here o'erwhelmed with your grief , A passion most resulting such a man , Cassio came hither .
While that the armed hand doth fight abroad , Th ' advised head defends itself at home .
Great and increasing .
She rendered life , Thy name so buried in her .
Tis twenty year till then .
Villainous whore !
To fetch her fan , her gloves , her mask , nor nothing ?
Peace , sirrah !
Sir Topas !
But till this afternoon his passion Ne'er brake into extremity of rage .
But I do see you're moved .
I do beseech your Grace to pardon me , and withal Forbear your conference with the noble duke .
Let me see , what think you of falling in love ?
Or say , sweet love , what thou desirest to eat .
Speak .
Good e'en , brother .
And so far am I glad it so did sort , As this their jangling I esteem a sport .
Is she so hot a shrew as she's reported ?
I know not .
Call him .
Therefore with frank and with uncurbed plainness Tell us the Dauphin's mind .
I am no fighter .
Beat me ?
My husband say that she was false !
Oh , much I fear some ill unthrifty thing .
If he , compact of jars , grow musical , We shall have shortly discord in the spheres .
Give me another horse !
I greet thy love Not with vain thanks but with acceptance bounteous , And will upon the instant put thee to 't .
Am I your bird ?
Thou didst drink The stale of horses and the gilded puddle Which beasts would cough at .
With what persuasion did he tempt thy love ?
When I spoke that , I was ill-tempered too .
Thus I do escape the sorrow Of Antony's death .
Only he hath not yet subscribed this : Where your Majesty demands that the king of France , having any occasion to write for matter of grant , shall name your Highness in this form and with this addition , in French : Nor this I have not , brother , so denied But your request shall make me let it pass .
Tedious" and "brief" ?
For do but stand upon the foaming shore , The chidden billow seems to pelt the clouds , The wind-shaked surge , with high and monstrous mane , Seems to cast water on the burning bear , And quench the guards of th ' ever-fixed pole .
So young , my lord , and true .
My father Is hard at study .
Your son , my lord , has paid a soldier's debt .
In such a night as this , When the sweet wind did gently kiss the trees And they did make no noise , in such a night Troilus methinks mounted the Trojan walls And sighed his soul toward the Grecian tents Where Cressid lay that night .
I know not what 'twas but distraction .
Who's there ?
Tis a wonder , by your leave , she will be tamed so .
If ever thou wilt thrive , bury my body .
Ay , truly , for the power of beauty will sooner transform honesty from what it is to a bawd than the force of honesty can translate beauty into his likeness .
Teach me .
I had forgot the reward .
I am sent before to make a fire , and they are coming after to warm them .
I had most need of blessing , and "Amen" Stuck in my throat .
You touched my vein at first .
I must employ you in some business Against our nuptial and confer with you Of something nearly that concerns yourselves .
You have a daughter called Elizabeth , Virtuous and fair , royal and gracious .
Have I not heard great ordnance in the field , And heaven's artillery thunder in the skies ?
Wake her not .
You should ask me what time o ' day .
I know thee not .
Here I am .
Come , Desdemona , I have but an hour Of love , of worldly matter and direction , To spend with thee .
Has here writ a letter to you .
Primo , secundo , tertio is a good play , and the old saying is , the third pays for all .
There is tears for his love , joy for his fortune , honor for his valor , and death for his ambition .
Death makes no conquest of this conqueror , For now he lives in fame , though not in life .
Well , I'll end the song. , Sirs , cover the while ; the duke will drink under this tree. , He hath been all this day to look you .
Away !
Oh well done !
I am not mad , Sir Topas .
Stoop , Romans , stoop , And let us bathe our hands in Caesar's blood Up to the elbows , and besmear our swords .
O , grief hath changed me since you saw me last , And careful hours with time's deformed hand Have written strange defeatures in my face .
Here .
If you would conjure in her , you must make a circle ; if conjure up Love in her in his true likeness , he must appear naked and blind .
How hast thou lost thy breath ?
Oh , my dear Cassio !
In spite of your heart , I think .
If we offend , it is with our good will .
Armed , my lord .
And make him with fair aegles break his faith , With Ariadne and Antiopa ?
Their residence , both in reputation and profit , was better both ways .
The will !
What offense , sweet Beatrice ?
I to the world am like a drop of water That in the ocean seeks another drop , Who , falling there to find his fellow forth , Unseen , inquisitive , confounds himself .
I pray you , fail me not .
I'll answer that .
Her body sleeps in Capels ' monument , And her immortal part with angels lives .
She speaks poniards , and every word stabs .
My charms I'll break , their senses I'll restore , And they shall be themselves .
What judgment shall I dread , doing no wrong ?
Name the day of marriage , and God give thee joy .
Two hundred ducats .
A touch , a touch , I do confess 't .
Here's neither bush nor shrub to bear off any weather at all .
There I have another bad match ! , a bankrupt , a prodigal who dare scarce show his head on the Rialto , a beggar that was used to come so smug upon the mart .
What , did he marry me to famish me ?
Thyself a queen , for me that was a queen , Outlive thy glory , like my wretched self .
Eternity was in our lips and eyes , Bliss in our brows' bent , none our parts so poor But was a race of heaven .
Dost thou not suspect my years ?
We took him for a coward , but he's the very devil incardinate .
What's that ?
A blessed labor , my most sovereign lord .
His better doth not breathe upon the earth .
You minion , you , are these your customers ?
I will not trouble you As yet to question you about your fortunes. , Give us some music , and , good cousin , sing .
Fear you the boar , and go so unprovided ?
But in my terms of honor I stand aloof , and will no reconcilement Till by some elder masters , of known honor , I have a voice and precedent of peace To keep my name ungored .
And here will rest me .
As long as hell and Richard likes of it .
A very pleasing night to honest men .
If so , my eyes are oftener washed than hers .
Approach .
Thou liest , malignant thing !
Do so , and bid my sweet prepare to chide .
Then Edgar was abused .
God's bodykins , man , much better .
By this scimitar That slew the Sophy and a Persian prince That won three fields of Sultan Solyman , I would o'erstare the sternest eyes that look , Outbrave the heart most daring on the earth , Pluck the young sucking cubs from the she-bear , Yea , mock the lion when he roars for prey , To win the lady .
Now , good my lord , lie here and rest awhile .
Let's have no more of this , let's to our affairs. , Forgive us our sins ! , Gentlemen , let's look to our business .
Sir , I must have that diamond from you .
Tide life , tide death , I come without delay .
Do you not hear him ?
His spirits hear me And yet I needs must curse .
Get you to church , and have a good priest that can tell you what marriage is .
You are not , Cassius .
Both wind and tide stays for this gentleman , And I , to blame , have held him here too long .
Sirrah , naked fellow , Poor Tom's a-cold .
Oh , yet I do repent me of my fury , That I did kill them .
I peseech you heartily , scurvy , lousy knave , at my desires , and my requests , and my petitions , to eat , look you , this leek .
I'll not be made a soft and dull-eyed fool To shake the head , relent and sigh , and yield To Christian intercessors .
That I have , lady .
Here on her breast There is a vent of blood , and something blown .
Why is Time such a niggard of hair , being , as it is , so plentiful an excrement ?
Well , I say no .
Come , "The croaking raven doth bellow for revenge , "
I am very glad to see you .
We both have fed as well , and we can both Endure the winter's cold as well as he .
Hot , hot , and moist .
Some say the Earth Was feverous and did shake .
Yet have I left a daughter .
The heavens do lour upon you for some ill. Move them no more by crossing their high will .
Most true .
And so , good Capulet , which name I tender As dearly as my own , be satisfied .
I can say little more than I have studied , and that question's out of my part .
Come , Dolabella , see High order in this great solemnity .
What it should be , More than his father's death , that thus hath put him So much from th ' understanding of himself , I can not dream of .
I understand not what you mean by this .
Why ask you ?
Ay , marry , sir , now it begins to work .
No offense i ' th ' world .
We are haunted .
What , sir , not yet at rest ?
So were you .
Mars's hot minion is returned again .
I wish , forbear .
I find you passing gentle .
O bear me witness , night , What man is this ?
Look upon Caesar .
Hear me a word , For I shall never speak to thee again .
He is coming .
Why , thou peevish sheep , What ship of Epidamnum stays for me ?
Do this expediently , and turn him going .
Is 't possible that on so little acquaintance you should like her ?
You a man ?
The gods withhold me !
Where is my father and my mother , Nurse ?
I am famished in his service .
But forbear , I say .
I set him there , sir , but his own disorders Deserved much less advancement .
That's a perilous shot out of an elder gun , that a poor and private displeasure can do against a monarch .
Alack , sir , you can not see your way .
The one , to save the money that he spends in tiring ; the other , that at dinner they should not drop in his porridge .
Give me leave. , I am a gentleman of Verona , sir , That hearing of her beauty and her wit , Her affability and bashful modesty , Her wondrous qualities and mild behavior , Am bold to show myself a forward guest Within your house , to make mine eye the witness Of that report which I so oft have heard .
At your choice , sir .
He supped at my house , but I therefore shake not .
O lamentable day !
How now !
The nature of bad news infects the teller .
If this uncouth forest yield anything savage , I will either be food for it or bring it for food to thee .
Sweet bodements !
Wilt come ?
With news the time's with labor , and throws forth Each minute some .
Thy master is a wise and valiant Roman .
Let her alone .
God save you , sir .
I'll know thy thoughts .
Be bloody , bold , and resolute .
Therefore to our best mercy give yourselves Or , like to men proud of destruction , Defy us to our worst .
I do remember now .
Come you to make confession to this Father ?
What of that ?
If he do blench , I know my course .
And if your love Can labor ought in sad invention , Hang her an epitaph upon her tomb And sing it to her bones .
Tis partly my own fault , Which death or absence soon shall remedy .
Sir Toby will be sworn that I am no fox , but he will not pass his word for two pence that you are no fool .
Take up her bed And bear her women from the monument .
Your statue spouting blood in many pipes , In which so many smiling Romans bathed , Signifies that from you great Rome shall suck Reviving blood , and that great men shall press For tinctures , stains , relics , and cognizance .
Remember that you call on me today .
I will not sleep , Hortensio , till I see her , And therefore let me be thus bold with you To give you over at this first encounter , Unless you will accompany me thither .
I swear I'll cuff you if you strike again .
What news ?
Send out more horses .
Tis certain then for Cyprus .
I have heard of your paintings too , well enough .
No , not for all the world .
He would not take the crown .
Then leave him out .
There are no tricks in plain and simple faith .
Meet me and Gratiano At Gratiano's lodging some hour hence .
Give me thy torch , boy .
Wash they his wounds with tears ?
This , Decius Brutus .
Content .
Who's there ?
Gratiano !
I did enact Julius Caesar .
Ay , Biddy , come with me. , What , man !
Thou art a villain !
This savors not much of distraction .
O , thou well-skilled in curses , stay awhile , And teach me how to curse mine enemies .
I am no villain .
If there be any in this assembly , any dear friend of Caesar's , to him I say that Brutus ' love to Caesar was no less than his .
Twill be recorded for a precedent , And many an error by the same example Will rush into the state .
Poor heart , adieu .
What follows , then , my lord ?
A good soft pillow for that good white head Were better than a churlish turf of France .
Only myself stood out ; For which , if I be lapsed in this place , I shall pay dear .
For love I followed him .
He has heard that word of some great man and now applies it to a fool .
I will return again into the house and desire some conduct of the lady .
Why would you be so fond to overcome The bonny prizer of the humorous duke ?
If you will watch his going thence ( which I will fashion to fall out between twelve and one ) you may take him at your pleasure .
Pray you now , Nay , do so , for indeed I have lost command .
What comfortable hour canst thou name , That ever graced me in thy company ?
Here's yet some liquor left .
Caesar , I shall .
I humbly do beseech you of your pardon For too much loving you .
Indeed , my lord , it is a most absolute and excellent horse .
I will not trouble thee , my child .
Hid'st thou that forehead with a golden crown Where should be branded , if that right were right , The slaughter of the prince that owed that crown And the dire death of my poor sons and brothers ?
Where we lay , Our chimneys were blown down and , as they say , Lamentings heard i ' th ' air , strange screams of death , And prophesying with accents terrible Of dire combustion and confused events New hatched to the woeful time .
Spoke like a tall man that respects thy reputation .
No .
No .
I learned it in England where indeed they are most potent in potting .
No , alas , I found it And I did give 't my husband .
You have astonished him .
Twas a rough night .
He doth , for he did bid Antonius Send word to you he would be there tomorrow .
I attend them with all respect and duty .
Use me well .
Pardon , dear father .
Give me the gown .
Oh , 'tis a gallant king !
It shall be done .
So 'tis to thee .
I almost die for food , and let me have it .
Is not your lord honorable without marriage ?
Away !
I should have chid you for not bringing it , But , like a shrew , you first begin to brawl .
Every one .
Hear Antony .
I am scarce in breath , my lord .
Tell him I am prompt To lay my crown at 's feet , and there to kneel .
You shall confess that you are both deceived .
That's our offer .
Provoke not battle Till we have done at sea .
By my life I do , which I tender dearly , though I say I am a magician .
We have willing dames enough .
No , sir , the worse .
If you'll come to supper tonight , you may .
The greater therefore should our courage be .
Virtue itself turns vice , being misapplied , And vice sometime by action dignified .
This admiration , sir , is much o ' th ' savor Of other your new pranks .
Dost thou not suspect my place ?
Lo , now , lo !
If it be man's work , I'll do 't .
Make haste , make haste , sirrah .
You have simply misused our sex in your love-prate .
There's no art To find the mind's construction in the face .
Tis my picture .
Nay , that's certain .
And look when I am king , claim thou of me The earldom of Hereford , and all the moveables Whereof the king my brother was possessed .
Simple , plain Clarence , I do love thee so That I will shortly send thy soul to heaven , If heaven will take the present at our hands .
Nay then , I'll run .
Poor and content is rich , and rich enough , But riches fineless is as poor as winter To him that ever fears he shall be poor .
And I for Rosalind .
As proper men as ever trod upon neat's leather have gone upon my handiwork .
By th ' mass , and 'tis like a camel indeed .
Proof enough to misuse the Prince , to vex Claudio , to undo Hero , and kill Leonato .
Give me your hand .
Thus ornament is but the guiled shore To a most dangerous sea , the beauteous scarf Veiling an Indian beauty , in a word , The seeming truth which cunning times put on To entrap the wisest .
Good sir , be a man , Think every bearded fellow that's but yoked May draw with you .
I dare avouch it , sir .
Either there is a civil strife in heaven , Or else the world , too saucy with the gods , Incenses them to send destruction .
Bespeak him a fortnight before. , I will have the heart of him if he forfeit , for were he out of Venice I can make what merchandise I will. , Go , go , Tubal , and meet me at our synagogue .
Besides , she uses me with a more exalted respect than anyone else that follows her .
Follow me and receive 't .
Beat him enough .
Signior Baptista , you are happily met. , Sir , this is the gentleman I told you of .
Think upon these gone .
Both with an Ah , mocker , that's the dog's name .
What might be toward , that this sweaty haste Doth make the night joint laborer with the day ?
He bears too great a mind .
Your way is shorter .
Juno and Ceres whisper seriously .
How now ?
To tell you where he lodges is to tell you where I lie .
Noses , ears , and lips .
I doubt some foul play .
Follow his chariot , like the greatest spot Of all thy sex .
And I .
God shield I should disturb devotion ! , Juliet , on Thursday early will I rouse ye .
I shall , my lord .
The sister to my wife , this gentlewoman , Thy son by this hath married .
Why should you think that I should woo in scorn ?
Peace , you rogue , no more o ' that .
It were a delicate stratagem to shoe A troop of horse with felt .
Out , you green sickness , carrion !
To see no pastime I .
Their names are pricked .
Thou told'st me they were stol'n unto this wood .
Where is she ?
Infirm of purpose !
Boy !
Why , whither , Adam , wouldst thou have me go ?
Madam , I'll take my leave .
If from the field I shall return once more To kiss these lips , I will appear in blood .
The captain that did bring me first on shore Hath my maid's garments .
Come , Sir Andrew , there's no remedy .
But these can not I command to any utterance of harmony .
How say you , Cassio ?
Had all his hairs been lives My great revenge had stomach for them all .
Upon his brow shame is ashamed to sit , For 'tis a throne where honor may be crowned .
Have you sent to Bottom's house ?
Out , out , brief candle !
What were these ?
But say , sir , is it dinnertime ?
I pause for a reply .
Then he is dead ?
Oh ho , oh ho !
But , mistress , know yourself .
Thou hast .
Gower is a good captain , and is good knowledge and literatured in the wars .
Vengeance , plague , death , confusion !
Hail , king !
Leave holloaing , man .
My lord , my lord , I will not hear you .
For this reason , if you'll know : That she's the choice love of Signior Gremio .
Get me ink and paper , And hire post horses .
Oh , banish me , my lord , but kill me not !
And she is exceeding wise .
Fare thee well .
Presently ?
Sawst thou the melancholy Lord Northumberland ?
Not a word of me .
Yet the gold bides still That others touch , and often touching will Wear gold ; yet no man that hath a name By falsehood and corruption doth it shame .
You embrace your charge too willingly .
A very even way , but no such friend .
How dost thou , Charles ?
Thy garments are not spotted with our blood , Nor thou within the compass of my curse .
Look what I have .
And then ?
A privilege never to see me more .
Here love , thou seest how diligent I am , To dress thy meat myself and bring it thee .
Her fallow leas The darnel , hemlock , and rank fumitory Doth root upon , while that the coulter rusts That should deracinate such savagery .
And wast thou fain , poor father , To hovel thee with swine and rogues forlorn In short and musty straw ?
I never hated thee .
If every of your wishes had a womb , And fertile every wish , a million .
I do beseech you To understand my purposes aright .
Let's follow .
Tis but an hour ago since it was nine , And after one hour more 'twill be eleven .
How but well , sir ?
Come , come , wrestle with thy affections .
This night I hold an old accustomed feast , Whereto I have invited many a guest Such as I love .
Whither away ?
Oh , rare for Antony !
I'll to the throng .
And to that place the sharp Athenian law Can not pursue us .
And so of men .
How if I answer "No" ?
No , faith , die by attorney .
For God's sake , send some other messenger .
She's a most triumphant lady , if report be square to her .
Not a soul But felt a fever of the mad and played Some tricks of desperation .
Therefore thou must be hanged at the state's charge .
Her father is Baptista Minola , An affable and courteous gentleman .
I'll in to counsel them .
For when rich villains have need of poor ones , poor ones may make what price they will .
Masters , never speak , we charge you , let us obey you go with us .
Out of their saddles into the dirt , and thereby hangs a tale .
For Antony , I have no ears to his request .
Can he that deny ?
Perchance she can not meet him .
You are too indulgent .
Dissolve , thick cloud , and rain , that I may say The gods themselves do weep !
This I wonder at , That he , unknown to me , should be in debt .
Knock , sir ?
Go , leave me .
I'll put 't in proof .
Made she no verbal question ?
What art thou that keep'st me out from the house I owe ?
In thunder , lightning , or in rain ?
The several messengers From hence attend dispatch .
Ay , that he was .
I'll catch it ere it come to ground .
That's all one .
Let not the heavens hear these telltale women Rail on the Lord's anointed .
Come , my lord , and in our flight Tell me how it came this night That I sleeping here was found With these mortals on the ground .
I have lived long enough .
Infect her beauty , You fen-sucked fogs drawn by the powerful sun , To fall and blister !
Yea , Signior , and depart when you bid me .
Good sooth , even thus .
And yet for aught I see , they are as sick that surfeit with too much as they that starve with nothing .
The other half Comes to the privy coffer of the state , And the offender's life lies in the mercy Of the Duke only 'gainst all other voice .
Arrest him , officer .
Go and say We purpose her no shame .
He is at hand , and Pindarus is come To do you salutation from his master .
Young man , have you challenged Charles the wrestler ?
He lays it on .
What had he done to make him fly the land ?
What , would you make me mad ?
By heaven , thy madness shall be paid by weight , Till our scale turn the beam .
Yes , 'tis Emilia. , 'T is like she comes to speak of Cassio's death , The noise was high .
Come , come .
It nothing ill becomes thee. , Aboard my galley I invite you all .
Do so , and after two days I will discharge thee .
God and our good cause fight upon our side .
Thy truth then be thy dower .
That by proscription and bills of outlawry , Octavius , Antony , and Lepidus Have put to death an hundred senators .
Good morrow to you .
For Monsieur Malvolio , let me alone with him .
Alack , what trouble Was I then to you !
Is the single man therefore blessed ?
But to Orlando : did he leave him there , Food to the sucked and hungry lioness ?
He is now in some commerce with my lady and will by and by depart .
Before my body I throw my warlike shield .
In his tail .
Brutus" will start a spirit as soon as "Caesar." Now in the names of all the gods at once , Upon what meat doth this our Caesar feed That he is grown so great ?
I dare swear he is no hypocrite but prays from his heart .
Adieu , good Monsieur Melancholy .
You told a lie , an odious , damned lie .
Caesar and Lepidus have made wars upon Pompey .
Will they not say afterwards , if they should grow themselves to common players ( as it is most like if their means are no better ) , their writers do them wrong to make them exclaim against their own succession ?
Why are our bodies soft and weak and smooth , Unapt to toil and trouble in the world , But that our soft conditions and our hearts Should well agree with our external parts ?
I'll tell you in your ear .
Nay , lay thee down and roar , For thou hast killed the sweetest innocent That e'er did lift up eye .
Dispatch , I say , and find the forester .
I ' faith , sir , you shall never need to fear .
Fie , Fie , lieutenant , You'll be ashamed for ever .
Brutus and Caesar , what should be in that "Caesar" ?
I drunk !
No king of England if not king of France .
Even now , now , very now , an old black ram Is tupping your white ewe .
Good madam , keep yourself within yourself .
If Cleopatra heard you , your reproof Were well deserved of rashness .
For the most part , too , they are foolish that are so .
That I did for him .
Tut , she's a lamb , a dove , a fool to him !
O Antony , Thou mine of bounty , how wouldst thou have paid My better service , when my turpitude Thou dost so crown with gold !
What's the news with thee ?
Fare you well , my liege .
Since I have your good leave to go away , I will make haste .
Not so , neither .
How dost thou , Benedick , the married man ?
Even so .
He dies !
Then I will kiss your lips , Kate .
Whose house ?
Doth she not count her blessed , Unworthy as she is , that we have wrought So worthy a gentleman to be her bride ?
Tell not me .
Tis now but four o'clock .
Where is the king ?
Smatter with your gossips , go .
Farewell , farewell .
Who lies i ' th ' second chamber ?
They're busy within .
Sweet Hero , now thy image doth appear In the rare semblance that I loved it first .
What countryman ?
A fig !
If he be sad , he wants money .
I pray you , will you take him by the arm ?
This if she perform , She shall not sue unheard .
Men shall deal unadvisedly sometimes , Which after-hours give leisure to repent .
But this is from my commission .
So I am free .
What art thou that dost grumble there i ' th ' straw ?
If it shall please you to make me a wholesome answer , I will do your mother's commandment .
But say , my lord , it were not registered , Methinks the truth should live from age to age , As 'twere retailed to all posterity , Even to the general all-ending day .
If so , then be not tongue-tied .
Call 'em .
Well , God-'a'-mercy .
Rage , blow !
Why , Fool ?
Go , And with your speediest bring us what she says And how you find of her .
She must change for youth .
But , sir , I will deliver his challenge by word of mouth , set upon Aguecheek a notable report of valor , and drive the gentleman ( as I know his youth will aptly receive it ) into a most hideous opinion of his rage , skill , fury , and impetuosity .
Your love says , like an honest gentleman , and a courteous , and a kind , and a handsome , and , I warrant , a virtuous , Where is your mother ?
Call them again .
Where art thou , Death ?
And be not jealous on me , gentle Brutus .
Dear sovereign , hear me speak .
This pernicious slave , Forsooth , took on him as a conjurer , And , gazing in mine eyes , feeling my pulse ,
O , welcome , father !
What's he that wishes so ?
I met the duke yesterday and had much question with him .
It is now two o'clock .
No more .
I could well wish courtesy would invent some other custom of entertainment .
Is his head worth a hat or his chin worth a beard ?
Why , the night gone by .
The duke of York commends him to your Majesty .
But if we fail , We then can do 't at land .
Well , my lord .
This , and Saint George to boot , What think'st thou , Norfolk ?
Well , Brutus , thou art noble .
Be kind and courteous to this gentleman .
Do you find Your patience so predominant in your nature That you can let this go ?
Something he left imperfect in the state which , since his coming forth , is thought of ; which imports to the kingdom so much fear and danger that his personal return was most required and necessary .
An apple , cleft in two , is not more twin Than these two creatures .
Stand , ho !
Nerissa teaches me what to believe .
Lead me on .
Pleaseth your Majesty to give me leave , I'll muster up my friends and meet your Grace Where and what time your Majesty shall please .
Hold , hold , my heart , And you , my sinews , grow not instant old , But bear me stiffly up .
Shut doors after you .
These are counselors That feelingly persuade me what I am." Sweet are the uses of adversity , Which , like the toad , ugly and venomous , Wears yet a precious jewel in his head .
Ay , my good lord .
That "may be" must be , love , on Thursday next .
Thou art a traitor , Off with his head .
To the death , my lord .
Commend me to thy lady .
Fair and noble hostess , We are your guest tonight .
My will , not all the world .
I take pleasure in singing , sir .
But , sirrah , you shall buy this sport as dear As all the metal in your shop will answer .
I think the duke will not be spoke withal .
Your Grace may do your pleasure .
Belike this is a man of that quirk .
I ' th ' air or th ' earth ?
Haply the seas and countries different With variable objects shall expel This something-settled matter in his heart , Whereon his brains still beating puts him thus From fashion of himself .
Thou wast never with me for anything when thou wast not there for the goose .
I will , sir .
Whate'er thou art , for thy good caution , thanks .
Thou bring'st me out of tune .
Will you dispatch us here under this tree , or shall we go with you to your chapel ?
Would not they speak ?
What noise is this ?
You are welcome , sir .
Give me thy hand .
It is well .
Now , Charmian !
O momentary grace of mortal men , Which we more hunt for than the grace of God !
My mistress , dearest , and I thus humble ever .
Hear me , you wrangling pirates , that fall out In sharing that which you have pilled from me !
A very forward March-chick !
The king hath heard them , to the which as yet There is no answer made .
That's not the tune .
Dismiss me .
Still so constant , lord .
Goneril with a white beard ?
I am not sorry neither .
You may tell every finger I have with my ribs .
You saw my master wink and laugh upon you ?
No messenger but thine , and all alone Tonight we'll wander through the streets and note The qualities of people .
The hand of death hath raught him .
I looked not for you yet , nor am provided For your fit welcome .
I can not say "whore , " It does abhor me now I speak the word .
Soldiers , sir .
If love be rough with you , be rough with love .
Well then , go you into hell ?
There is an old poor man Who after me hath many a weary step Limped in pure love .
Press near and second him .
It touches you , my lord , as much as me .
Oh , fie upon them !
O thou weed , Who art so lovely fair and smell'st so sweet That the sense aches at thee , would thou hadst ne'er been born !
If you have any music that may not be heard , to 't again .
Let us quit all And give our vineyards to a barbarous people .
Fall not a tear , I say .
But I remember now I am in this earthly world , where to do harm Is often laudable , to do good sometime Accounted dangerous folly .
How long within this wood intend you stay ?
Marcus Luccicos , is not he in town ?
Give him the cup .
I charge thee do so , as thou art my child .
With no less religion than if thou wert indeed my Rosalind .
And be a happy mother by the deed .
You know I say nothing to him , for he understands not me , nor I him .
If more , the more thou'st wronged me .
Do not laugh at me , For as I am a man , I think this lady To be my child Cordelia .
Pause awhile , And let my counsel sway you in this case .
What is he that you ask for , niece ?
We are yet but young in deed .
I prithee speak to me as to thy thinkings , As thou dost ruminate , and give thy worst of thoughts The worst of words .
Therefore prepare you .
Milan and Naples have More widows in them of this business ' making Than we bring men to comfort them .
I know no ways to mince it in love , but directly to say , "I love you." Then if you urge me farther than to say , "Do you , in faith ? " I wear out my suit .
Quarrel , sir ?
Why , get you gone !
My heart prays for him , though my tongue do curse .
Go with me to a notary , seal me there Your single bond , and , in a merry sport , If you repay me not on such a day , In such a place , such sum or sums as are Expressed in the condition , let the forfeit Be nominated for an equal pound Of your fair flesh , to be cut off and taken In what part of your body pleaseth me .
Read the will !
Zounds , who is there ?
Night's candles are burnt out , and jocund day Stands tiptoe on the misty mountain tops .
How many things by season seasoned are To their right praise and true perfection !
Not so , my lord .
My niece Plantagenet Led in the hand of her kind aunt of Gloucester ?
Thou fond mad man , hear me a little speak .
O proud death , What feast is toward in thine eternal cell , That thou so many princes at a shot So bloodily hast struck ?
Right , as snow in harvest .
Stay , you imperfect speakers , tell me more .
Yea , noise ?
They did , Fluellen .
I will play the swan .
Where is that damned villain , Tranio , That faced and braved me in this matter so ?
The god of Jupiter .
Then , in the name of God and all these rights , Advance your standards .
What , will you not suffer me ?
Since this fortune falls to you , Be content and seek no new .
But who comes here ?
Then you live about her waist , or in the middle of her favors ?
Night hangs upon mine eyes .
If thou dost I shall never love thee after .
But will you woo this wildcat ?
Light , I say , light !
Tell me but truly , but then speak the truth , Do you not love my sister ?
I will go on the slightest errand now to the Antipodes that you can devise to send me on .
Caesar and Antony have ever won More in their officer than person .
Say from whence You owe this strange intelligence , or why Upon this blasted heath you stop our way With such prophetic greeting .
To fetch my poor distracted husband hence .
Go to , well said , well said .
Tis Banquo's then .
Sirrah , I'll teach thee a speech .
Thou art not conquered .
My fairy lord , this must be done with haste .
Come forth , I say !
Iago beckons me .
Why didst thou send me forth , brave Cassius ?
Wherein went he ?
Macbeth .
I am an ass , indeed ; you may prove it by my long ears. , I have served him from the hour of my nativity to this instant , and have nothing at his hands for my service but blows .
Ay , I praise God , and I have merited some love at his hands .
I'll leave you , lady .
Tis well for thee That , being unseminared , thy freer thoughts May not fly forth of Egypt .
For your father's remembrance , be at accord .
Who wrongs him ?
If we are like you in the rest , we will resemble you in that .
O , teach me how I should forget to think !
Romeo is coming .
Go make thyself like a nymph o ' th ' sea .
I ne'er saw this before .
It is not day .
Foul , wrinkled witch , what mak'st thou in my sight ?
And so perchance may he be .
May it be done ?
Make it no wonder .
Throw this slave Upon the dunghill. , Regan , I bleed apace .
O Jupiter , how weary are my spirits !
Welcome hither .
Do 't .
Sir , he may live .
Come thou no more for ransom , gentle herald .
Nay , come , I pray you , sir , give me the chain .
I dare pawn down my life for him that he hath wrote this to feel my affection to your honor and to no other pretense of danger .
Let us take the law of our sides .
What harmony is this ?
Else the Puck a liar call .
He is of a very melancholy disposition .
Come , boy , with me .
You stand amazed , But be of comfort .
His passport shall be made , And crowns for convoy put into his purse .
Come , let us to the castle .
It now draws toward night .
This is old .
Caesar .
Let me report to him Your sweet dependency , and you shall find A conqueror that will pray in aid for kindness Where he for grace is kneeled to .
Revolving this will teach thee how to curse .
They lack retention .
But , room , fairy !
Marry , we were sent for to the justices .
It is not seen enough ; you should wear it in your cap .
But where is Kate ?
Fear me not. , She and the duke her husband !
It is a pretty youth , not very pretty , But sure he's proud , and yet his pride becomes him .
What is 't o'clock ?
Why then , he is alive .
I shall do't , my lord .
We have done our course .
Then half Signor Benedick's tongue in Count John's mouth , and half Count John's melancholy in Signor Benedick's face , With a good leg and a good foot , uncle , and money enough in his purse , such a man would win any woman in the world , if he could get her goodwill .
Away !
Then murder's out of tune , And sweet revenge grows harsh .
Now is it Rome indeed , and room enough , When there is in it but one only man .
Is Romeo slaughtered , and is Tybalt dead ?
Yea , marry , let them come before me .
Besides , old Gremio is heark'ning still , And happily we might be interrupted .
Antonio .
Let them not live to taste this land's increase , That would with treason wound this fair land's peace .
But I do prophesy the election lights On Fortinbras .
Better thou Hadst not been born than not t ' have pleased me better .
Why , why is this ?
But if I had wit enough to get out of this wood , I have enough to serve mine own turn .
It may well be called Jove's tree when it drops forth such fruit .
I can as well be hanged as tell the manner of it .
Repair thy wit , good youth , or it will fall To cureless ruin .
Alas , I sent you money to redeem you By Dromio here , who came in haste for it .
The Duke does greet you , general , And he requires your haste-post-haste appearance , Even on the instant .
The noble duke my master , My worthy arch and patron , comes tonight .
God , the best maker of all marriages , Combine your hearts in one , your realms in one .
There's no true drop of blood in him to be truly touched with love .
I can not love him .
Here comes two of the banished duke's pages .
We being strangers here , how dar'st thou trust So great a charge from thine own custody ?
Upon the right hand I .
Take up the body .
Here is more news .
Wilt thou know Th ' effect of what I wrote ?
Tis a very excellent piece of work , madam lady .
Farewell !
It does , my boy .
I'll not trust your word .
He is not here .
They are not near my conscience .
I'll tell thee more of this another time .
I have had four quarrels , and like to have fought one .
How think you of it ?
Surely I do believe your fair cousin is wronged .
Nor will do none tomorrow .
That done , repair to Pompey's theatre .
My young remembrance can not parallel A fellow to it .
Why , what effects of passion shows she ?
Roundly replied .
True , sir .
If any , speak , for him have I offended .
I say a husband .
But , sir , be you ruled by me .
Be not you ashamed to show , he'll not shame to tell you what it means .
No , by no means .
When Jacob grazed his uncle Laban's sheep , This Jacob from our holy Abram was , As his wise mother wrought in his behalf , The third possessor , ay , he was the third , And what of him ?
Ay , noble lord .
For me , that I may surely keep mine oath , I will be married to a wealthy widow , Ere three days pass , which hath as long loved me As I have loved this proud disdainful haggard .
Tell me .
I know thy quality .
True , madam .
If Signor Leonato be her father , she would not have his head on her shoulders for all Messina , as like him as she is .
Let me see her .
My lord , his throat is cut .
Not till God make men of some other metal than earth .
Trust me , I fear it has .
Softly and swiftly , sir , for the priest is ready .
Shake it off .
Make the doors upon a woman's wit , and it will out at the casement .
If I speak like myself in this , let him be whipped that first finds it so .
And then came Pyramus .
Lord Hamlet , Heaven secure him !
I would not change this hue Except to steal your thoughts , my gentle queen .
What wilt thou tell her , Nurse ?
And so am I , being else by faith enforced To call young Claudio to a reckoning for it .
What wilt thou do for her ?
Why then , you are in love .
Let's see .
But then the mind much sufferance doth o'erskip When grief hath mates and bearing fellowship .
Signor Antonio Commends him to you .
Taurus !
I am hurt .
The greater cantle of the world is lost With very ignorance .
And , honest company , I thank you all , That have beheld me give away myself To this most patient , sweet and virtuous wife .
Tis certain .
The same .
Therefore be double damned , Swear thou art honest !
How tartly that gentleman looks !
Nay then , let the devil wear black , for I'll have a suit of sables .
I know the man .
There comes an old man and his three sons , I could match this beginning with an old tale .
If one should be a prey , how much the better To fall before the lion than the wolf !
You hear how he importunes me .
And thane of Cawdor too : went it not so ?
He is attended with a desperate train .
I am to blame .
Watch me like Argus .
Love looks not with the eyes but with the mind .
I pray you , sirs , lie in my tent and sleep .
More , Domitius : My lord desires you presently .
And cross-gartered ?
The wager thou hast won , and I will add Unto their losses twenty thousand crowns , Another dowry to another daughter , For she is changed as she had never been .
He seems to have a foreknowledge of that too , and therefore comes to speak with you .
O my brave Emperor , this is fought indeed !
Ay , madam , from the reach of these my hands .
Harder , harder .
Two of my brother's men bound !
Why , if thou never wast at court , thou never saw'st good manners ; if thou never saw'st good manners , then thy manners must be wicked , and wickedness is sin , and sin is damnation .
You cram these words into mine ears against The stomach of my sense .
I know a wench of excellent discourse , Pretty and witty , wild and yet , too , gentle .
You shall have the mustard Or else you get no beef of Grumio .
You know me well .
Then tell me , what makes he upon the seas ?
Come not near Casca .
I will come again .
And indeed it takes From our achievements , though performed at height , The pith and marrow of our attribute .
Dost thou think I care for a satire or an epigram ?
O , that once more you knew but what you are !
Ah , my back , my back !
What if I had said I had seen him do you wrong ?
So I hope .
Dighton and Forrest , whom I did suborn To do this piece of ruthless butchery , Albeit they were fleshed villains , bloody dogs , Melted with tenderness and mild compassion , Wept like two children in their deaths ' sad story .
Masters , the duke is coming from the temple , and there is two or three lords and ladies more married .
Who you are and what you would are out of my welkin , I might say "element , " but the word is overworn .
Lepidus is high-colored .
This is the penthouse under which Lorenzo Desired us to make stand .
They'll tell the clock to any business that We say befits the hour .
Not know me yet ?
You , you , ay , you !
I will tomorrow , And betimes I will , to the weird sisters .
Richard loves Richard ; that is , I and I .
They are friends , Ratcliffe and Lovell .
Is it four o'clock ?
Forget to think of her .
If you meet the Prince in the night , you may stay him .
I see thy age and dangers make thee dote .
To fright you thus methinks I am too savage ; To do worse to you were fell cruelty , Which is too nigh your person .
Bless the isle of Cyprus and our noble general Othello !
Why , he's a devil , a devil , a very fiend .
Your friends are up and buckle on their armor .
Sans fable , she herself reviled you there .
Roderigo !
No boasting like a fool .
I shall be saved by my husband .
Fear nothing .
So swift a pace hath thought that even now You may imagine him upon Blackheath , Where that his lords desire him to have borne His bruised helmet and his bended sword Before him through the city .
Yet hear me speak .
Then , in God's name , march .
No doubt , my liege , if each man do his best .
But come , young waverer , come , go with me , In one respect I'll thy assistant be , For this alliance may so happy prove To turn your households ' rancor to pure love .
It goes not forward .
In voices well divulged , free , learned , and valiant ; And in dimension and the shape of nature A gracious person .
Though far more cause , yet much less spirit to curse Abides in me .
Signior , it is the Moor .
On him I lay what you would lay on me , The right and fortune of his happy stars , Which God defend that I should wring from him .
They could be content To visit other places , and come down With fearful bravery , thinking by this face To fasten in our thoughts that they have courage .
I understand thee not .
You have some cause ; they have not .
Be large in mirth .
Here .
Let's alone , And do the murder first .
In the corrupted currents of this world Offense's gilded hand may shove by justice , And oft 'tis seen the wicked prize itself Buys out the law .
I will have it all mine .
Farewell .
If thou canst love a fellow of this temper , Kate , whose face is not worth sunburning , that never looks in his glass for love of anything he sees there , let thine eye be thy cook .
Hanging and wiving goes by destiny .
Where should I lose that handkerchief , Emilia ?
This fellow's of exceeding honesty And knows all quantities , with a learned spirit , Of human dealings .
You shall be king .
Never king of England Had nobles richer , and more loyal subjects , Whose hearts have left their bodies here in England And lie pavilioned in the fields of France .
He received them Of him that brought them .
Abide within .
Advise yourself .
All this is so , but what of this , my lord ?
If you do stir abroad , go armed .
I had been happy if the general camp , Pioneers and all , had tasted her sweet body , So I had nothing known .
The third part , then , is drunk .
The thoughts of people .
Will you pluck your sword out of his pilcher by the ears ?
The sight of lovers feedeth those in love .
He did receive his letters and is coming .
No , my profound heart .
Is it a true thing ?
As mine eyes opened , I saw their weapons drawn .
Sir , I shall meet your wit in the career , an you charge it against me .
I'll bring thee word Straight how 'tis like to go .
They'll mar my counterfeiting .
Tis mightiest in the mightiest .
Know you any , Hero ?
And I know , my lord , If law , authority , and power deny not , It will go hard with poor Antonio .
Here lies the county slain , And Juliet bleeding , warm and newly dead , Who here hath lain these two days buried. , Go , tell the Prince .
But how should Prospero Be living and be here ?
What money , sir ?
Pitchers have ears .
Lo , where he comes !
You lie .
Bring the villain forth .
Let them come in .
Come you from old Bellario ?
Therefore , Lord Constable , haste on Montjoy And let him say to England that we send To know what willing ransom he will give .
On the ground Sleep sound .
Nay , like enough , for I stay dinner there .
Messala , This is my birthday , as this very day Was Cassius born .
Donalbain .
Did I , Charmian , Ever love Caesar so ?
Canst thou bring me to th ' party ?
Lay on , Macduff , And damned be him that first cries , "Hold , enough ! " I would the friends we miss were safe arrived .
Tis said they eat each other .
But sup them well and look unto them all .
If a man do not erect in this age his own tomb ere he dies , he shall live no longer in monument than the bell rings and the widow weeps .
I'll send to one in Mantua , Where that same banished runagate doth live , Shall give him such an unaccustomed dram That he shall soon keep Tybalt company .
Why , then Othello and Desdemona return again to Venice .
O Pyramus , arise !
I am in this commanded to deliver The noble duke of Clarence to your hands .
The gods forbid !
I pray you , sir , my ring or else the chain .
How canst thou make me satisfaction ?
Will it never be day ?
Three thousand ducats for three months , and Antonio bound .
Let me work .
Let fall thy blade on vulnerable crests ; I bear a charmed life , which must not yield To one of woman born .
If fortune be not ours today , it is Because we brave her .
Why , you speak truth .
With the same 'havior that your passion bears Goes on my master's grief .
He has almost supped .
What is my name ?
This weaves itself perforce into my business .
And we understand him well , How he comes o'er us with our wilder days , Not measuring what use we made of them .
You come most carefully upon your hour .
They were villains , murderers .
So. , Thus then , thou most renowned : Caesar entreats Not to consider in what case thou stand'st , Further than he is Caesar .
What is she ?
Yet , when we can entreat an hour to serve , We would spend it in some words upon that business , If you would grant the time .
The foul practice Hath turned itself on me .
Thou seest that all the grace that she hath left Is that she will not add to her damnation A sin of perjury .
Because that , like a jack , thou keep'st the stroke Betwixt thy begging and my meditation .
Thou speak'st with all thy wit ; and yet , i ' faith , With wit enough for thee .
Fine , i ' faith !
Nay , I think it is scurvy , and begin to find myself fopped in it .
For the intent and purpose of the law Hath full relation to the penalty , Which here appeareth due upon the bond .
Tis to be doubted , madam .
Leave , gentle wax , and , manners , blame us not .
But , Othello , speak .
I will weep for thee , For this revolt of thine methinks is like Another fall of man. , Their faults are open .
What is it ?
Well may you prosper .
The man i ' th ' moon !
Good my lord , enter here .
That will be ere the set of sun .
Our power is ready ; Our lack is nothing but our leave .
Jove , Jove , this shepherd's passion Is much upon my fashion .
Where have I been ?
I and my bosom must debate awhile , And then I would no other company .
You shall , my lord .
There is some strange thing toward , Edmund .
There it goes , Silver !
Is it good e'en ?
In what part of her body stands Ireland ?
Yes , a dozen , and as many to th ' vantage as would store the world they played for .
Some dear cause Will in concealment wrap me up awhile .
Good my lord .
Very well .
Slid , I'll after him again and beat him .
Stay , then .
Hearts , tongues , figures , scribes , bards , poets , can not Think , speak , cast , write , sing , number , hoo ! , His love to Antony .
How now , Lord Stanley , what's the news ?
I found you as a morsel cold upon Dead Caesar's trencher .
Where had he wine ?
Lend me thy handkerchief .
My lord , I will not .
How now , spirit ?
It comes upon me. , Art thou any thing ?
Farewell , my lord .
Come , throw it o'er my face .
If the matter were good , my lord , I durst swear it were his .
Let me not name it to you , you chaste stars , It is the cause .
Amaze the welkin with your broken staves ,
Why , sir , you know this is your wedding day .
What dost thou think ?
The whole butt , man .
Knock you here , sir ?
How that might change his nature , there's the question .
But of that tomorrow , When therewithal we shall have cause of state Craving us jointly .
His taints and honors Waged equal with him .
Welcome hither .
Good old knight , Collect them all together at my tent .
Hear the ambassadors .
Tonight I'll mourn with Hero .
Alas , sir , it is worse for me than so , For I have bills for money by exchange From Florence , and must here deliver them .
Ingrateful fox , 'tis he .
Smile you my speeches as I were a fool ?
I'll do 't , but it dislikes me .
I will not hold thee long .
Jove's lightning , the precursors O ' th ' dreadful thunderclaps , more momentary And sight-outrunning were not .
Here is thy fee .
Not I , sir .
Perhaps some merchant hath invited him , And from the mart he's somewhere gone to dinner .
To feed were best at home ; From thence , the sauce to meat is ceremony ; Meeting were bare without it .
Thou shalt be loggerhead. , Good faith , 'tis day .
I remember thine eyes well enough .
Is it they ?
Why , my boy ?
Come , go with me apart .
Farewell , my lord .
Not shine today ?
Indeed , they are disproportioned .
So I , being young , till now ripe not to reason .
Neither good nor bad .
My dearest love , Duncan comes here tonight .
I like the work well .
Show .
What's the matter ?
Adieu , Till your return at night .
But doth he know that I am in this forest and in man's apparel ?
Rude ragged nurse , old sullen playfellow For tender princes , use my babies well .
Judge me , you gods !
Of very ill manner .
My duty can not suffer To obey in all your daughters ' hard commands .
Our severed navy too Have knit again , and fleet , threat'ning most sealike .
Master , if you do , expect spoon meat ; or bespeak a long spoon .
We have sworn , my lord , already .
Nay , how now , where are you ?
Can you make no use of your discontent ?
We follow thee. , Juliet , the county stays .
Let us be satisfied !
Please it your Grace lead on ?
O !
Let me have open means to come to them , And soon I'll rid you from the fear of them .
Did 't not wake you ?
While one with moderate haste might tell a hundred .
Now tell me how long you would have her after you have possessed her .
Do that good mischief which may make this island Thine own for ever , and I , thy Caliban , For aye thy foot-licker .
Show .
Help , ho !
Now from head to foot I am marble-constant .
O , let us have him , for his silver hairs Will purchase us a good opinion And buy men's voices to commend our deeds .
Ay .
My gracious sovereign , now in Devonshire , As I by friends am well advertised , Sir Edward Courtney and the haughty prelate , Bishop of Exeter , his elder brother , With many more confederates are in arms .
Iago ?
That is where we dined , Where Dowsabel did claim me for her husband .
Why , then let's home again .
I give him curses , yet he gives me love .
To no more Will I give place or notice .
But let me to my fortune and the caskets .
Know you not he has ?
Now , forward with your tale. , Prithee , stand farther off .
Farewell till then .
Out of these convertites There is much matter to be heard and learned .
Never , O fault ! , revealed myself unto him Until some half-hour past , when I was armed .
There thou mightst behold the great image of authority : a dog's obeyed in office .
Ay , in the catalogue ye go for men , As hounds and greyhounds , mongrels , spaniels , curs , Shoughs , water-rugs , and demi-wolves are clept All by the name of dogs .
We'll beat 'em into bench-holes .
And what to ?
There's two or three of us have seen strange sights .
This is the door .
Hence !
Will you come to bed , my lord ?
I thought thou hadst been resolute .
Let her know 't. , And he will fill thy wishes to the brim With principalities .
Thou hast forspoke my being in these wars And sayst it is not fit .
Not once , nor twice , but twenty times you have .

From top to toe ?
Go hence with diligence .
Hark further .
I pray you , let me see it .
My lord , I have .
Safe in a ditch he bides , With twenty trenched gashes on his head , The least a death to nature .
You should for that have reprehended him .
Yes , that the king is dead .
Hold , take thou that and that .
And begged he pardon ?
Send thy man away .
Ay , if I know the letters and the language .
We found him in the churchyard .
Why , what is that to you ?
I confess the cape .
I prithee , peace .
Nay , that's not your way .
He hath no daughters , sir .
Nay , if they lead to any ill , I will leave them at the next turning .

No , my lord , not I. Alas , it is the baseness of thy fear That makes thee strangle thy propriety .

I will have none on 't .
This sight of death is as a bell , That warns my old age to a sepulcher .
Fut , I should have been that I am , had the maidenliest star in the firmament twinkled on my bastardizing .
Lives , sir .
Well , my dread lord , so must I call you now .
But how , my lord , shall we resist it now ?
As far , my lord , as will fill up the time 'Twixt this and supper .
How is 't ?
So that , conclusions to be as kisses , if your four negatives make your two affirmatives , why then the worse for my friends and the better for my foes .
I know her father , though I know not her , And he knew my deceased father well .
Keep thy word .

Spirits , which by mine art I have from their confines called to enact My present fancies .
A horse , a horse , my kingdom for a horse !

And a true lover of the holy Church .
It is an honor that I dream not of .
Speak , is 't out o ' th ' way ?
Feeling so the loss , Can not choose but ever weep the friend .
I will speak lower .
No , my lord .
I pray thee , cease thy counsel , Which falls into mine ears as profitless As water in a sieve .
What would you have ?
Uncharitably with me have you dealt , And shamefully my hopes by you are butchered .
Thou art not by mine eye , Lysander , found .
Tis his own blame .
O heavens !
Certain , men should be what they seem .
Bring thou the master to the citadel .
I do I know not what and fear to find Mine eye too great a flatterer for my mind .

I was about to protest I loved you .
Wonder not Nor be grieved .
So could I , faith , boy , to have the next wish after , That Lucentio indeed had Baptista's youngest daughter .
My honored lord !
Why , what would you ?
So are the Prince and Claudio , who accused her Upon the error that you heard debated .
Well , come , my Kate .
Go we to him .
No , no , they would not .
These time ambles withal .
There remain And fortify it strongly 'gainst the French .
Look you who comes here , a young man and an old in solemn talk .
She's gone forever .
Our expectation hath this day an end .
But he hath chid me hence and threatened me To strike me , spurn me , nay , to kill me too .
Mistake no more .
Time hath not yet so dried this blood of mine Nor age so eat up my invention Nor fortune made such havoc of my means Nor my bad life reft me so much of friends But they shall find , awaked in such a kind , Both strength of limb and policy of mind , Ability in means and choice of friends , To quit me of them throughly .

Caesar's sister is called Octavia .
This would have seemed a period To such as love not sorrow , but another To amplify too much would make much more And top extremity .
Come .
Nor I .
Toward Peloponnesus are they fled .
The air Nimbly and sweetly recommends itself Unto our gentle senses .
No , and swears she never will .
Peter Quince , What sayest thou , bully Bottom ?
About a hoop of gold , a paltry ring That she did give me , whose posy was For all the world like cutler's poetry Upon a knife , "Love me and leave me not." What talk you of the posy or the value ?
But chiefly Him that you termed , sir , "the good old Lord Gonzalo , " His tears run down his beard like winter's drops From eaves of reeds .
Tomorrow , as he purposes .
Oh , heaven forgive me !
What , art thou hurt ?
So please you , something touching the Lord Hamlet .
Ay , let the county take you in your bed .
To both their deaths shalt thou be accessory .
I hear a knocking At the south entry .

It is not yet near day .
Be of good cheer .
We thank your Honor .
More light and light , more dark and dark our woes !
What , is he angry ?
My noble brother !
That's sides and heart .
He does make our fire , Fetch in our wood , and serves in offices That profit us. , What , ho !
Come .
Therefore he hates me .
My servant , sir !
I dreamt there was an emperor Antony .
You have told me she hath received them and returned me expectations and comforts of sudden respect and acquaintance , but I find none .
Kate like the hazel-twig Is straight and slender and as brown in hue As hazel nuts , and sweeter than the kernels .
So befall my soul As this is false he burdens me withal .

Thy lands and all things that thou dost call thine Worth seizure , do we seize into our hands Till thou canst quit thee by thy brother's mouth Of what we think against thee .
I am informed thoroughly of the cause .
I'll write straight to my sister To hold my very course .
Hush , Thou think'st there is no more such shapes as he , Having seen but him and Caliban .
Not that I love you not .
Madam , here comes my lord .
Say "a day" without the "ever." No , no , Orlando , men are April when they woo , December when they wed. Maids are May when they are maids , but the sky changes when they are wives .
And I have met a gentleman Hath promised me to help me to another , A fine musician to instruct our mistress .
Turning th ' accomplishment of many years Into an hour-glass ; for the which supply , Admit me chorus to this history ; Who , prologue-like , your humble patience pray Gently to hear , kindly to judge our play .
You may , sir .
What a pestilent knave is this same !
Do you wish then that the gods had made me poetical ?
Look how the floor of heaven Is thick inlaid with patens of bright gold .
She will not come .
What , think you we are Turks or infidels ?
Look , he recovers .
I was sure your lordship did not give it me .
That is , to watch her , as we watch these kites That bate and beat and will not be obedient .
Oh , If you but knew how you the purpose cherish Whiles thus you mock it !
Send the deed after me , And I will sign it .
Stay !
Ay , my lord .
And Cassius too .
Are your doors locked ?
O sir , pardon me !
Are you a married man or a bachelor ?
Use me but as your spaniel , spurn me , strike me , Neglect me , lose me .
This broken joint between you and her husband entreat her to splinter , and , my fortunes against any lay worth naming , this crack of your love shall grow stronger than it was before .
And did you see the handkerchief ?
My lord .
A lantern , slaughtered youth , For here lies Juliet , and her beauty makes This vault a feasting presence full of light .
Do not deny to him that you love me .
And so he fell .
I have heard her swear 't .
Poor venomous fool Be angry and dispatch .
Come , what says Romeo ?
Lord , Lord , she will be a joyful woman .
Here , Peter Quince .
Thou know'st not me .
She robs thee of thy name , And thou wilt show more bright and seem more virtuous When she is gone .
It must be thought on .
Let him approach .
Methinks I have a great desire to a bottle of hay .
Is he gone and hath nothing ?
I have spoke thus much To mitigate the justice of thy plea , Which if thou follow , this strict court of Venice Must needs give sentence 'gainst the merchant there .
Didst thou not fall out with a tailor for wearing his new doublet before Easter ?
Let him look to his bond .
Let me go with you .

Come , sisters , cheer we up his sprites , And show the best of our delights .
Both which , Master Constable , You have .
No ?
Couple it with something .
When ?
Titinius , if thou lovest me , Mount thou my horse , and hide thy spurs in him Till he have brought thee up to yonder troops And here again , that I may rest assured Whether yond troops are friend or enemy .
God bless you , sir .
Is it new and old too ?
Honest , ay , honest .
What was 't That moved pale Cassius to conspire ?
That same villain , Romeo .
Macbeth shall never vanquished be until Great Birnam Wood to high Dunsinane Hill Shall come against him .
Come , good Athenian .
That will I , should I die the hour after .
Into my grave .
Never excuse , for when the players are all dead , there needs none to be blamed .
Forever and forever farewell , Brutus .
She is banished .
Let's make us med'cines of our great revenge , To cure this deadly grief .
Or sleep I now and think I hear all this ?
Who goes there , ha ?
Stand not amazed .
How the moon sleeps with Endymion And would not be awaked .
All will be well .
No money , on my faith , but the gleek .
I would forget it fain , But oh , it presses to my memory , Like damned guilty deeds to sinners ' minds .
When being not at your lodging to be found The Senate hath sent about three several guests To search you out .
Hold , take these keys , and fetch more spices , Nurse .
Let them go .
What should I stay , In this wild world ?
Before you hazard , for in choosing wrong I lose your company .
So full of shapes is fancy That it alone is high fantastical .
Celerity is never more admired Than by the negligent .
Thou art The armorer of my heart .
Would thou and those thy scars had once prevailed To make me fight at land !
Send for the man and ask him .
When think you that the sword goes up again ?
I know that voice .
I leave my duty a little unthought of and speak out of my injury .
You think I'll weep ?
Tis a hooded valor , and when it appears , it will bate .
You taught me first to beg , and now methinks You teach me how a beggar should be answered .
Can anything be made of this ?
Have you delivered to her our decree ?
Ride , ride , Messala .
Not with salt tears .
You should then have accosted her , and with some excellent jests , fire-new from the mint , you should have banged the youth into dumbness .
Ready .
I protest , in the sincerity of love and honest kindness .
Now , what news on the Rialto ?
I am old now , And these same crosses spoil me .
I ' th ' clout , i ' th ' clout .
Woe to the hand that shed this costly blood !
Is not that he that lies upon the ground ?
Pray you , sit down , For now we sit to chat as well as eat .
This is the man , this is Antonio , To whom I am so infinitely bound .
The king hath strictly charged the contrary .
If thou kill'st me , boy , thou shalt kill a man .
Tell him there's a post come from my master with his horn full of good news .
Near and on speedy foot .
Yes , sir , I have indeed .
I would my horse had the speed of your tongue and so good a continuer .
I think I can discover him , if you please To get good guard and go along with me .
This is Signor Antonio .
Madam !
Therefore speak no more .
We doubt not of a fair and lucky war , Since God so graciously hath brought to light This dangerous treason lurking in our way To hinder our beginnings .
Not I , believe me .
Master Constable , you go not the way to examine .
He said the truth .
I come not , friends , to steal away your hearts .
Ay , Casca .
I found him under a tree like a dropped acorn .
It can not be .
I know where I will wear this dagger then .
Sir , I will answer any thing .
Merciful heaven !
I charge thee , be not thou more grieved than I am .
The Count's gentleman , one Cesario .
My words are dull .
My love doth so approve him That even his stubbornness , his checks , his frowns , Prithee , unpin me , have grace and favor .
We know thy charge , Brakenbury , and will obey .
Another way I have to man my haggard , To make her come and know her keeper's call .
A very fine one .
A stoup of wine !
Yet there he was , and there I found this credit , That he did range the town to seek me out .
Be assured you may .
Thou hast railed on thyself .
Our whole city is much bound to him .
My father dead , my fortune lives for me .
These happy masks that kiss fair ladies ' brows , Being black , puts us in mind they hide the fair .
Can you remember any of the principal evils that he laid to the charge of women ?
She is too big , I hope , for me to compass .
And this may help to thicken other proofs That do demonstrate thinly .
Let me speak proudly : tell the constable We are but warriors for the working day ; Our gayness and our gilt are all besmirched With rainy marching in the painful field .
I am hers .
To him in thine own voice , and bring me word how thou findest him .
Yea , from the table of my memory I'll wipe away all trivial fond records , All saws of books , all forms , all pressures past That youth and observation copied there , And thy commandment all alone shall live Within the book and volume of my brain , Unmixed with baser matter .
Lives he ?
Now , Antony , our hopes are answered .
If you would not , it were a good sign that I should quickly have a new father .
I would be friends with you and have your love , Forget the shames that you have stained me with , Supply your present wants and take no doit Of usance for my moneys , and you'll not hear me !
Come from thy ward , For I can here disarm thee with this stick And make thy weapon drop .
Let me but bind it hard , within this hour It will be well .
Dear my lord , if you in your own proof Have vanquished the resistance of her youth And made defeat of her virginity , I know what you would say : if I have known her , You will say she did embrace me as a husband , And so extenuate the forehand sin .
Have not you love enough to bear with me , When that rash humor which my mother gave me Makes me forgetful ?
Meantime God grants that we have need of you .
And when she put it on , she made me vow That I should neither sell nor give nor lose it .
Thou art come to answer A stony adversary , an inhuman wretch Uncapable of pity , void and empty From any dram of mercy .
Nay , but I bar tonight .
I will do this , if you can bring it to any opportunity .
Draw , you rascal .
How fares your majesty ?
Then shall I swear to Kate , and you to me , And may our oaths well kept and prosp'rous be .
Marry , this it is , sir .
Open your gates .
Why , there's more gold .
How now , my pretty knave ?
I believe drink gave thee the lie last night .
And thou unfit for any place but hell .
He begins at curfew and walks till the first cock .
I thank you for your pains and courtesy .
I'll confine myself no finer than I am .
Tis worse than murder To do upon respect such violent outrage .
My face I'll grime with filth , Blanket my loins , elf all my hair in knots , And with presented nakedness outface The winds and persecutions of the sky .
The funeral baked meats Did coldly furnish forth the marriage tables .
To what effect ?
What men daily do , not knowing what they do !
We , ignorant of ourselves , Beg often our own harms , which the wise powers Deny us for our good , so find we profit By losing of our prayers .
Tis very much .
Is yonder the man ?
How "strangely" ?
But if you have a stomach , to 't , i ' God's name : You shall have me assisting you in all .
What needs this iterance , woman ?
It is heresy .
Look , here I have you .
A charge we bear i' th' war , And as the president of my kingdom will Appear there for a man .
The king is coming .
What , all so soon asleep ?
I think there's never a man in Christendom Can lesser hide his love or hate than he , For by his face straight shall you know his heart .

Why , there was a crown offered him ; and , being offered him , he put it by with the back of his hand , thus ; and then the people fell a-shouting .
But yet you draw not iron , for my heart Is true as steel .
Seest thou here , This is the mouth o ' th ' cell .
Oh , but she is wise .
Say , if th ' hadst rather hear it from our mouths , Or from our masters ' .
Cold friends to me .
Came they not by you ?
What , from myself ?
If not , the Fates with traitors do contrive .
Presently .
My life upon 't , young though thou art , thine eye Hath stay'd upon some favor that it loves .
Let each man render me his bloody hand .
Which way ran he that killed Mercutio ?
What a pied ninny's this ! , Thou scurvy patch ! , I do beseech thy greatness , give him blows And take his bottle from him .
Ride thou unto the horsemen on yond hill .
Marry , that can Hero !
He may win , And what is music then ?
Which is the lady I must seize upon ?
Malcolm and Donalbain , the king's two sons , Are stol'n away and fled , which puts upon them Suspicion of the deed .
A good old commander and a most kind gentleman .
I will survey th ' inscriptions back again .
All's cheerless , dark , and deadly .
Even as men wracked upon a sand , that look to be washed off the next tide .
If you choose that wherein I am contained , Straight shall our nuptial rites be solemnized .
No , make it two more .
Where is your sister , and Hortensio's wife ?
Alas , I took great pains to study it , and 'tis poetical .
I know my physic will work with him .
Appear and pertly ! , No tongue .
Service .
I say you are not .
Was not that letter from fair Jessica ?
But if that I am I , then well I know Your weeping sister is no wife of mine , Nor to her bed no homage do I owe .
Therefore , my sweet Rose , my dear Rose , be merry .

Thou art a strange fellow .
Winter garments must be lined , So must slender Rosalind .
Mark Antony , here , take you Caesar's body .
If that same demon that hath gulled thee thus Should with his lion gait walk the whole world , He might return to vasty Tartar back And tell the legions "I can never win A soul so easy as that Englishman's." Oh , how hast thou with jealousy infected The sweetness of affiance !
I can be patient .
I owe you much , and , like a willful youth , That which I owe is lost .
Please you , farther .
I would not be cured , youth .
On my knees I beg That you'll vouchsafe me raiment , bed , and food." Good sir , no more .
For I am he am born to tame you , Kate , And bring you from a wild Kate to a Kate Conformable as other household Kates .
All may be well enough .
What's your name ?
Expound unto me , boy .
And lovers ' absent hours More tedious than the dial eightscore times !
But I have , sir , a son by order of law , some year older than this , who yet is no dearer in my account .
I am very sorry that you are not well .
Our general's wife is now the general .
This is old Ninny's tomb .
Will not he ?

The skin is good for your broken coxcomb .
To none but thee , no more but when to thee .
My stomach is not constant .
To this chair bind him. , Villain , thou shalt find , By the kind gods , 'tis most ignobly done To pluck me by the beard .
Was this ambition ?
Wit shall not go unrewarded while I am king of this country .
I did not think , sir , to have met you here .
But till I come again , No bed shall e'er be guilty of my stay , No rest be interposer 'twixt us twain .
Dead .
To what base uses we may return , Horatio .
Give me your hand .
We must not now displease him .
Is 't possible ?
Madam , I am most apt to embrace your offer .
I hate ingratitude more in a man Than lying , vainness , babbling , drunkenness , Or any taint of vice whose strong corruption Inhabits our frail blood , O heavens themselves !
What beard were I best to play it in ?
Most royal sir , Fleance is 'scaped .
Do then , but I'll not hear .
Ay , my good lord .
What would you , Desdemona ?
How ?
Do thou meet me presently at the harbor. , Come hither .
O gentle lady , do not put me to 't , For I am nothing , if not critical .
My lord , my lord !
Who knows not where a wasp does wear his sting ?
Pinion him like a thief , bring him before us .
Were you made the messenger ?
So shalt thou show me friendship .
Fail not our feast .
Who talks of my nation ?
Casca will tell us what the matter is .
And so I shall catch the fly , your cousin , in the latter end and she must be blind too .
That's my office .
But if you know not this my manners tell me We have your wrong rebuke .
Why , do not your courtier's hands sweat ?
I am afeard there are few die well that die in a battle , for how can they charitably dispose of anything , when blood is their argument ?
Let us seek out some desolate shade and there Weep our sad bosoms empty .
I pray you tell me .
You must not , sir , mistake my niece .
This night I'll spend Unto a dismal and a fatal end .
The French might have a good prey of us if he knew of it , for there is none to guard it but boys .
Ass , I doubt not .
Quickly send , Be brief in it , to th ' castle , for my writ Is on the life of Lear and on Cordelia .
Full half an hour .
I'll no more of you .
Have at you with a proverb : shall I set in my staff ?
Suppose th ' Ambassador from the French comes back , Tells Harry that the king doth offer him
Yes , just .
Good morrow , Benedick .
Old Montague is come , And flourishes his blade in spite of me .

And death , not Romeo , take my maidenhead !
Ratcliffe !
O , what a fall was there , my countrymen !
I can not fly , But , bearlike , I must fight the course .
Let's stay and hear the will .
My lord , I have news to tell you .
Speak , man .
Ah , do not tear away thyself from me !
I must go in .
Say that they slack their duties
He's married , madam .
Tranio , let's go .

Come hither , good Volumnius .
She In th' habiliments of the goddess Isis That day appeared , and oft before gave audience , As 'tis reported , so .
Why , man , they did make love to this employment .
Very well .
How is 't , my noble lord ?
I have it ready for thee .
O , one too much by thee !
She is persuaded I will marry her , out of her own love and flattery , not out of my promise .
She's like a liar gone to burning hell .
Your crown's awry .
Weapons , arms ?
O thou good Kent , how shall I live and work To match thy goodness ?
Here's to thee , Menas !
Tis the last service that I shall command you .
I grant I am a woman , but withal A woman well-reputed , Cato's daughter .
I thank thee for that jest .
Bade him anon return and here speak with me , The which he promised .
Then pardon him , sweet father , for my sake .
But when we in our viciousness grow hard , Oh , misery on 't ! , the wise gods seel our eyes , In our own filth drop our clear judgments , make us Adore our errors , laugh at 's while we strut To our confusion .
No , as I am a Christian .
Farewell , sweet lord , and sister .
Trouble us not .
He was not born to shame .
Is it the fashion that discarded fathers Should have thus little mercy on their flesh ?
Tis hatched , and shall be so .
Well , thou dost best .

She had a song of "Willow , " An old thing 'twas , but it expressed her fortune And she died singing it .
I hear thou must , and nothing may prorogue it , On Thursday next be married to this county .
Pray ye , sir ?
So we grew together , Like to a double cherry , seeming parted But yet an union in partition , Two lovely berries molded on one stem ;
Hero thinks surely she will die , for she says she will die if he love her not , and she will die ere she make her love known , and she will die if he woo her rather than she will bate one breath of her accustomed crossness .
The love that follows us sometime is our trouble , Which still we thank as love .
Be patient till the last .
For God's love , let me hear .
Calls my lord ?
I wish it might , for now I am your fool .
Oh , monstrous !
With all my heart. , Some three or four of you Go give him courteous conduct to this place. , Meantime the court shall hear Bellario's letter .
Go thou to Juliet , help to deck up her .
They did entreat me to acquaint her of it , But I persuaded them , if they loved Benedick , To wish him wrestle with affection And never to let Beatrice know of it .
Proceed .
Whither are you going ?
Have patience , sir .
The time is free .
We will yet do well .
Nay , guiltiness Will speak , though tongues were out of use .
All hail , great master !
Pooh , you speak like a green girl , Unsifted in such perilous circumstance .
Confined together In the same fashion as you gave in charge , Just as you left them , all prisoners , sir , In the line grove which weather-fends your cell .
My deeds upon my head .
But the rarity of it is , which is indeed almost beyond credit , As many vouched rarities are .
Thanks , Guildenstern and gentle Rosencrantz .
But little .
The people love me , and the sea is mine .
In one voyage Did Claribel her husband find at Tunis ; And Ferdinand , her brother , found a wife Where he himself was lost ; Prospero , his dukedom In a poor isle ; and all of us , ourselves When no man was his own .
I know thee well , a serviceable villain , As duteous to the vices of thy mistress As badness would desire .
I prithee , put them off .
But this good comfort bring I to your Highness : The Breton navy is dispersed by tempest .
No !
Look you , Cassio and my husband !
Did he receive you well ?
If I do die before thee , prithee , shroud me In one of these same sheets .
There's another .
Yet Count Claudio may hear , for what I would speak of concerns him .
Farewell .
Fathers that wear rags Do make their children blind .
You are a fool. , You , niece , provide yourself .
The gray-eyed morn smiles on the frowning night , Checkering the eastern clouds with streaks of light , And fleckled darkness like a drunkard reels From forth day's path and Titan's fiery wheels .

Nothing .

Robin Starveling , you must play Thisbe's mother. , Tom Snout , the tinker ?
Where is he now ?
Give me my armor .
More , I prithee , more .
A laughter .
Lord , let me never have a cause to sigh , Till I be brought to such a silly pass !
It is a nipping and an eager air .
What is the success ?
Go tell him of this .

It was divided Between her heart and lips .
Come , sweet Audrey .
Thou art a soul in bliss , but I am bound Upon a wheel of fire , that mine own tears Do scald like molten lead .
And I am sick when I look not on you .
I prithee , recount some of them .
Tell me once more what title thou dost bear .
Look down , you gods , And on this couple drop a blessed crown , For it is you that have chalked forth the way Which brought us hither .
Here I stand , your slave , A poor , infirm , weak , and despised old man .
Nay then , I will not .
I pray thee , good Horatio , wait upon him .
Though all things foul would wear the brows of grace , Yet grace must still look so .
The honorable lady of the house , which is she ?
Tis no less , I tell you , for the bawdy hand of the dial is now upon the prick of noon .
I did love you once .
Thy wild acts denote The unreasonable fury of a beast .
What news from Genoa ?

Now , as thou lovest me , let me see his letter .
What call you the carriages ?
For both our sakes , I would that word were true .
Thus do I ever make my fool my purse .
I beseech you , follow straight .
But come what sorrow can , It can not countervail the exchange of joy That one short minute gives me in her sight .
In God's name , what art thou ?
But this is trifling , And all the more it seeks to hide itself The bigger bulk it shows .
There are my keys. , But wherefore should I go ?
Go to , charm your tongue .
My lord and master loves you .
What are thy comings in ?
O wonderful son that can so 'stonish a mother !
So will it fare with Claudio .
I , sir ?

We shall further think on 't .
Keep your word , Silvius , that you'll marry her If she refuse me .
How now ?
And most dear actors , eat no onions nor garlic , for we are to utter sweet breath .
Bruised pieces , go .
Do you not remember he saw a flea stick upon Bardolph's nose , and he said it was a black soul burning in hell ?
For who would bear the whips and scorns of time , Th ' oppressor's wrong , the proud man's contumely , The pangs of despised love , the law's delay , The insolence of office , and the spurns That patient merit of th ' unworthy takes , When he himself might his quietus make With a bare bodkin ?
Say not so , Agrippa .
I had as lief thou didst break his neck as his finger .
And let her speak of me before her father .
If not , he foams at mouth and by and by Breaks out to savage madness .
The foe vaunts in the field .
Do not desire to see this letter .

Lucillius and Titinius , bid the commanders Prepare to lodge their companies tonight .
Come , come with me , and we will make short work .
To seek my uncle in the Forest of Arden .
Arise , you shall not kneel .
I will this night , In several hands , in at his windows throw , As if they came from several citizens , Writings all tending to the great opinion That Rome holds of his name , wherein obscurely Caesar's ambition shall be glanced at .
Ram thou thy fruitful tidings in mine ears , That long time have been barren .
Nay , I will give thee a kiss .
O braggart vile and damned furious wight , The grave doth gape , and doting death is near .
Not so hot .
Hoo !

All this done , Repair to Pompey's porch , where you shall find us .
How came he mad ?
And now I'll do 't .
tis not so now .
Take thou that .
For , you know , Pyramus and Thisbe meet by moonlight .
These ducats pawn I for my father here .
Shall I speak a word in your ear ?
There is no other way , Unless thou couldst put on some other shape And not be Richard , that hath done all this .
I am glad that my weak words Have struck but thus much show of fire from Brutus .
Zounds , I'll entreat no more .
I took no more pains for those thanks than you take pains to thank me .
Welcome , my lord .
And my trust , Like a good parent , did beget of him A falsehood in its contrary as great As my trust was , which had indeed no limit , A confidence sans bound .

The business of the state does him offence , And he does chide with you .
Dolor comes to him , indeed .
Farewell .
It is gone .
Do 't , knight .
In your dumps ?
Therefore prepare thee to cut off the flesh .
It is to be all made of faith and service , And so am I for Phoebe .
It was wont to hold me but while one tells twenty .
This is a sleepy tune .
Yea , just so much as you may take upon a knife's point and choke a daw withal .

I am for the air .
His very opinion in the letter !

Pompey is strong at sea , And it appears he is beloved of those That only have feared Caesar .
Who's here ?
Look behind you , my lord .
It were good that Benedick knew of it by some other , if she will not discover it .
And then the boy , his clerk , That took some pains in writing , he begged mine .
Therefore the moon , the governess of floods , Pale in her anger , washes all the air , That rheumatic diseases do abound .
Speak not .
I did not think you could have been so angry .
Wrench his sword from him .
You are not wood , you are not stones , but men .
Lay her i ' th ' earth , And from her fair and unpolluted flesh May violets spring !
Then away she started To deal with grief alone .
As you from crimes would pardoned be , Let your indulgence set me free .
I warrant thee .
What did you enact ?
Faith , we may put up our pipes and be gone .
Poor Antony !
Ay , more .
A segregation of the Turkish fleet .
Your brother the Bastard is fled from Messina .
Doth this news hold of good King Edward's death ?
Is he come ?
Therefore the sadness is without limit .
What will you give us ?
What's the matter , dear ?
You know not what you do .
How !
The lady is dead upon mine and my master's false accusation .
I do not see them bleed .
Where hast thou been , my heart ?
Tweaks me by the nose ?
You may be pleased to catch at mine intent By what did here befall me .
Therefore , when he sees reason of fears as we do , his fears , out of doubt , be of the same relish as ours are .
Stand aside .
Will you know them then ?
The cunning of her passion Invites me in this churlish messenger .
I can read .
Oh , curse of marriage That we can call these delicate creatures ours And not their appetites !
Oh , the difference of man and man !
Sir , in good faith , or in sincere verity , Under th ' allowance of your great aspect , Whose influence , like the wreath of radiant fire On flickering Phoebus ' front , What mean'st by this ?
Alack the day .
Be thou familiar but by no means vulgar .
Bid the players make haste .
So said , so done , is well .
Our worser thoughts heavens mend .
Sir Topas , Sir Topas , good Sir Topas , go to my lady , Out , hyperbolical fiend !
For I ne'er saw true beauty till this night .
Who steals my purse steals trash .
I would they'd fight i' th' fire or i' th' air , We'd fight there too .
What say you sir ?
Say , Voltemand , what from our brother Norway ?

What news ?
Let us to the field .
I did so , and take heed on 't , Make it a darling like your precious eye .
Fly not .
Say you so ?
I am a very foolish fond old man , Fourscore and upward , not an hour more nor less .
Prithee , be cheerful .

A contagious breath .

O Phoebe , Phoebe , Phoebe !
Shall I strike at it with my partisan ?
One fairer than my love ?

Where's Potpan , that he helps not to take away ?
But truly , for mine own part , if I were as tedious as a king , I could find it in my heart to bestow it all of your worship .
Sebastian was my father ; Such a Sebastian was my brother too , So went he suited to his watery tomb .
Where lodges he ?
I wonder that you will still be talking , Signor Benedick .
Why , as a woodcock to mine own springe , Osric .
So please you , he is here at the door and importunes access to you .
As much to him , else is his thanks too much .
May I with right and conscience make this claim ?
Flies may do this , but I from this must fly .
Many will swoon when they do look on blood .
Thou art sensible in nothing but blows , and so is an ass .
My name is Edgar , and thy father's son .
Why , how now , cousin !
Down from the waist they are centaurs , though women all above .

Must I bite ?
You must contrary me .
I wonder of their being here together .
But what prevention ?
Comes there any more of it ?
Do you not hear me speak ?
I am not in the giving vein today .
How can that be , when you have the voice of the king himself for your succession in Denmark ?
Where is my lord the duke of Gloucester ?
Why should he follow ?

Here is the number of the slaughtered French .
All is not well .
Where be the sacred vials thou shouldst fill With sorrowful water ?
Then patiently hear my impatience .
I can not hear of any that did see her .
He no more shall see my face .
God save you , sir !
Off with his son George's head !
Call you me "fair" ?
Fare thee well .
I would be loath to have you overflown with a honey bag , signor .
Give me my robe .
But she is now the wife of Marcus Antonius .
Go , keep us company , And we shall make full satisfaction. , Thirty-three years have I but gone in travail Of you , my sons , and till this present hour My heavy burden ne'er delivered. , The Duke , my husband , and my children both , And you , the calendars of their nativity , Go to a gossips ' feast , and go with me .
When time shall serve , let but the herald cry , And I'll appear again .
An 'twere to me , I should be mad at it .
No , thy words are too precious to be cast away upon curs .
I do not like the Tower , of any place. , Did Julius Caesar build that place , my lord ?
Where , where , Messala , doth his body lie ?
It is , it is .

No grave upon the earth shall clip in it A pair so famous .
Ay , and this .
I am for you .
Demetrius loves her , and he loves not you .

He knows me as the blind man knows the cuckoo , By the bad voice .
Ah , he is young , and his minority Is put unto the trust of Richard Gloucester , A man that loves not me nor none of you .

Duke Frederick , hearing how that every day Men of great worth resorted to this forest , Addressed a mighty power , which were on foot In his own conduct , purposely to take His brother here and put him to the sword .
And let him ply his music .
Tis torture and not mercy .
They will surely do us no harm .
What is his name ?
Look then to be well edified when the fool delivers the madman .
It is "music with her silver sound" because musicians have no gold for sounding .
Besides , I have some business in the town .
And I for no woman .
Give me audience , good madam .
When came this to you ?
That I love her , I feel .
But , good Kate , mock me mercifully , the rather , gentle princess , because I love thee cruelly .
What say you then to Falconbridge , the young baron of England ?
I am afraid this great lubber , the world , will prove a cockney .
Which is the villain ?
She will taste as like this as a crab does to a crab .
Here will I rest me till the break of day .
Even he .
Thou art a boil , A plague-sore or embossed carbuncle In my corrupted blood .
Do not bid me speak .
His wits are gone .
I mean not cuckold mad , But sure he is stark mad .
Away with the dotard !
You may relish him more in the soldier than in the scholar .
This fellow I remember Since once he played a farmer's eldest son .
God make your Majesty joyful , as you have been .
A conduit , girl ?
That very time I saw ( but thou couldst not ) Flying between the cold moon and the Earth , Cupid all armed .
Are they married , think you ?
How do you , madam ?
Worse and worse .
Thus have I politicly begun my reign , And 'tis my hope to end successfully .
And how you may be converted I know not , but methinks you look with your eyes as other women do .
Shall I go fetch your nightgown ?
Very well took , i ' faith , wisely , wisely .
The strings , my lord , are false .
There was none such in the army of any sort .
Mark Antony shall say I am not well , And for thy humor I will stay at home .
But have I fall'n , or no ?
But what's your jest ?
If she be black , and thereto have a wit , She'll find a white that shall her blackness fit .
Why should you fall into so deep an O ?
See where he looks out of the window .
Thou hast mettle enough in thee to kill care .
Humbly on my knee I crave your blessing .
What's the matter ?
Ay , madam , but returns again tonight .
Where did I leave ?
Curse not thyself , fair creature ; thou art both .
Even when you please , since you will have it so .
Be curst and brief .
Small joy have I in being England's queen .
Now in respect it is in the fields , it pleaseth me well ; but in respect it is not in the court , it is tedious .
You will take little delight in it , I can tell you , there is such odds in the man .
Come .
Turn , hellhound , turn !
There is occasions and causes why and wherefore in all things .
More , I prithee , more .
What , have you lost your wits ?
Added to these , Of knights , esquires , and gallant gentlemen , Eight thousand and four hundred , of the which , Five hundred were but yesterday dubbed knights .
How now ?
Mine ear , I thank it , brought me to thy sound But why unkindly didst thou leave me so ?
What do they in the north When they should serve their sovereign in the west ?
How now , Horatio ?
Ay , my lord .
But one fiend at a time , I'll fight their legions o'er .
Believe me , sir , they butt together well .
True .
How now , Shylock ?
For not alone The death of Fulvia , with more urgent touches , Do strongly speak to us , but the letters too Of many our contriving friends in Rome Petition us at home .
Most noble Caesar !
Dark night , that from the eye his function takes , The ear more quick of apprehension makes .
Get you all three into the boxtree .
I doubt not that , since we are well-persuaded We carry not a heart with us from hence That grows not in a fair consent with ours , Nor leave not one behind that doth not wish Success and conquest to attend on us .
But I shall crave your pardon .
There's nothing in her yet .
Well , Jove , not I , is the doer of this , and he is to be thanked .
Calphurnia here , my wife , stays me at home .
This accident is not unlike my dream , Belief of it oppresses me already .
Arise , I say !
Go in , and weep not .
How shall I answer you ?
Here's one comes in his shirt , with light and weapons .
Now , fellow , What is there ?
Ah , for our father , for our dear lord Clarence !
We will not fail .
Turn from me then that noble countenance Wherein the worship of the whole world lies .
Be certain , nothing truer .
So shall he waste his means , weary his soldiers , Doing himself offense , whilst we , lying still , Are full of rest , defense , and nimbleness .
Tush , tush , man , never fleer and jest at me .
I know his trumpet .
I should know that voice .
How do you , pretty lady ?
Is it so brave a lass ?
I do not find that thou deal'st justly with me .
You thought because he could not speak English in the native garb , he could not therefore handle an English cudgel .
Lord Mayor , the reason we have sent , Look back !
Know you before whom , sir ?
And I do think she's thirty .
Stand to 't .
I think that thou art just and think thou art not .
He hath refused it in the open court .
I'll be thy second .
Will you give her o'er ?
They are entirely welcome .
Though the wisdom of nature can reason it thus and thus , yet nature finds itself scourged by the sequent effects .
Death is my heir .

At sea , I think .
When I think , I must speak .
Ay , sir , I thank God .
Mistake me not .
While grace is saying , hood mine eyes Thus with my hat , and sigh and say , "Amen" , Use all the observance of civility Like one well studied in a sad ostent To please his grandam , never trust me more .
Before me , she's a good wench .
Very easily possible .
Therefore , farewell .
Good fool , help me to some light and some paper .
Alas , he is too young .
Gentlemen , rise .
You tallow face !
Tis with cares .
For me , the gold of France did not seduce , Although I did admit it as a motive The sooner to effect what I intended ; But God be thanked for prevention , Which I in sufferance heartily will rejoice , Beseeching God and you to pardon me .
I thank my noble lord .
It signs well , does it not ?
Well , I am not fair , and therefore I pray the gods make me honest .
If I do live , I will be good to thee .
Let's draw our weapons .
What , wouldst thou have a serpent sting thee twice ?
And you .
Once more , Cesario , Get thee to yond same sovereign cruelty .

Approach the chamber , and destroy your sight With a new Gorgon .
Varrus and Claudio !
Sir , sir , that can not be .
But though thou art adjudged to the death , And passed sentence may not be recalled But to our honour's great disparagement , Yet will I favor thee in what I can .
He hath .
Lead him to my bower .
What needed , then , that terrible dispatch of it into your pocket ?
I see , sir , you are liberal in offers .
False to me ?
Doth he not deserve well ?
Comes his army on ?
And now I have the boy , I will undo This hateful imperfection of her eyes .
Fair daylight ?
How did you find the quarrel on the seventh cause ?
I will not fail you .
Henceforth I never will be Romeo .
I will kiss your hand , and so I leave you .

Hand in hand with fairy grace Will we sing and bless this place .

My lord , this would not be believed in Venice , Though I should swear I saw 't .
Is this the madman ?
Write them together , yours is as fair a name .
Who could refrain , That had a heart to love , and in that heart Courage to make 's love known ?
Is 't good or bad ?
Could you not take some occasion without giving ?
Prithee , do not turn me about .
No beast so fierce but knows some touch of pity .
It may be his enemy is a gentleman of great sort , quite from the answer of his degree .
But if you be remembered , I did not bid you mar it to the time .
O my Christian ducats !
This is the day wherein I wished to fall By the false faith of him who most I trusted .
Ay , ay .
If your leisure served , I would speak with you .
Fear me not .
What , says the married woman you may go ?
Tell him we could have rebuked him at Harfleur , but that we thought not good to bruise an injury till it were full ripe .
Let 't be so , good Corporal Nym .

Nothing , good monsieur , but to help Cavalery Cobweb to scratch .
What would you ?
Do they grow rusty ?
Are you wise ?
And I do think , or else this brain of mine Hunts not the trail of policy so sure As it hath used to do , that I have found The very cause of Hamlet's lunacy .
How is it else the "man i ' th ' moon" ?
With much , much more dismay I view the fight than thou that makest the fray .

For our losses , his exchequer is too poor ; for th ' effusion of our blood , the muster of his kingdom too faint a number ; and for our disgrace , his own person , kneeling at our feet but a weak and worthless satisfaction .
On a trice , so please you , Even in a dream were we divided from them And were brought moping hither .
A carrion death , within whose empty eye There is a written scroll .
I prithee , be gone .
I think we do know the sweet Roman hand .
I tell you 'tis not very well .
Let me not , Since I have my dukedom got And pardoned the deceiver , dwell In this bare island by your spell , But release me from my bands With the help of your good hands .
You must to Parthia .

Will you yield and this avoid Or , guilty in defense , be thus destroyed ?
The ladies , her attendants of her chamber Saw her abed , and in the morning early They found the bed untreasured of their mistress .
You are welcome for his sake .
It is my birthday .
I have a daughter , have while she is mine , Who in her duty and obedience , mark , Hath given me this .
I pray you , father , being weak , seem so .
But here the lady comes .
Even since you left it .
I thank you , gentle uncle .
Be patient , for the prize I'll bring thee to Shall hoodwink this mischance .

Behold and see .
Saw you no more ?
My present business calls me from you now .
He shall pay for him that hath him , and that soundly .
Good madam , do .
I'll mark the play .
And now methinks I have a mind to it .
Still be 't yours .
And doubt not , sir , but she will well excuse Why at this time the doors are made against you .
What I should deny , As this I would , ay , though thou didst produce My very character , I'd turn it all To thy suggestion , plot , and damned practice .
They that add , moreover , he's drunk nightly in your company .
No , my lord .
I am not to you known , Though in your state of honor I am perfect .
This disease is beyond my practice .
But I'll catch thine eyes , Though they had wings .
What news with you , sir ?
If thou delight to view thy heinous deeds , Behold this pattern of thy butcheries .
Antonio , as I heard in Genoa , What , what , what ?
Let's see once more this saying graved in gold , "Who chooseth me shall gain what many men desire." Why , that's the lady .
Well , I will be so much a sinner , to be a double-dealer .
If your Majesties is remembered of it , the Welshmen did good service in a garden where leeks did grow , wearing leeks in their Monmouth caps , which , your Majesty know , to this hour is an honorable badge of the service .
By this , I think , the dial points at five .
There is some ill a-brewing towards my rest , For I did dream of money bags tonight .
Alas , their love may be called appetite , No motion of the liver , but the palate , That suffer surfeit , cloyment , and revolt ; But mine is all as hungry as the sea , And can digest as much .
The fiend is strong within him .
Here's to Caesar .
I'll go farther off .
If thou rememb'rest not the slightest folly That ever love did make thee run into , Thou hast not loved .
Thou hast amazed me .
How I dote on thee !
Yea , my lord , but I can cross it .
When I was with him I have heard him swear To Tubal and to Chus , his countrymen , That he would rather have Antonio's flesh Than twenty times the value of the sum That he did owe him .
My lord , that would dishonor him !
Why , no , sir .
Most constantly .
Ay , and brought off the field .
Well , sir , I'll bring you to our master Lear And leave you to attend him .
I ' faith , coz , 'tis he .
Pardon me , dear Rosalind .
Thou look'st like him that knows a warlike charge .
I protest unto thee , Good heart , and i ' faith , I will tell her as much .
I shall serve you , sir , Truly , however else .
Pray God , I say , I prove a needless coward !
I'll warrant him for drowning though the ship were no stronger than a nutshell and as leaky as an unstanched wench .
The most infectious pestilence upon thee !
The dram of evil Doth all the noble substance of a doubt To his own scandal .
A wretched soul , bruised with adversity We bid be quiet when we hear it cry , But were we burdened with like weight of pain , As much or more we should ourselves complain .
Renowned duke , vouchsafe to take the pains To go with us into the abbey here And hear at large discoursed all our fortunes , And all that are assembled in this place That by this sympathized one day's error Have suffered wrong .
Dost thou mean the crown ?
Unaccommodated man is no more but such a poor , bare , forked animal as thou art. , Off , off , you lendings !
Of this discourse we more will hear anon. , Egeus , I will overbear your will .
This is the fruits of whoring .
What ceremony else ?
Methinks he looks as though he were in love .
My fan , Peter .
And when please you to say so ?
There he is .
Passion , I see , is catching , for mine eyes , Seeing those beads of sorrow stand in thine , Began to water .
What , household stuff ?
Did he live now ,
By the apostle Paul , shadows tonight Have struck more terror to the soul of Richard Than can the substance of ten thousand soldiers Armed in proof and led by shallow Richmond .
Go to him , Dolabella , bid him yield .
And squabble ?
I beg for justice , which thou , Prince , must give .
Tis bargained 'twixt us twain , being alone , That she shall still be curst in company .
Oh , then I see that madmen have no ears .
Such was the very armour he had on When he the ambitious Norway combated .
but you see my finger Hath not the ring upon it .
Where is that viper ?
Though now this grained face of mine be hid In sap-consuming winter's drizzled snow , And all the conduits of my blood froze up , Yet hath my night of life some memory , My wasting lamps some fading glimmer left , My dull deaf ears a little use to hear .
We have here recovered the most dangerous piece of lechery that ever was known in the commonwealth .
Though I die for it , as no less is threatened me , the king my old master must be relieved .
Make thee a fortune from me .
Let me go with him .
Proud , " and "I thank you , " and "I thank you not , " And yet "not proud" ?
Shall we go seek Benedick and tell him of her love ?
Fie , there is no such man .
I hope better .
What men may do !
I shall win at the odds .
I was killed i ' th ' Capitol .
If you have poison for me , I will drink it .
Methinks I see thee now , thou art so low As one dead in the bottom of a tomb .
Thy bed , lust-stained , shall with lust's blood be spotted .
I hope they will not come upon us now .
How lost you company ?
I can , Petruchio , help thee to a wife With wealth enough , and young and beauteous , Brought up as best becomes a gentlewoman .
Nay , but this dotage of our general's O'erflows the measure .
I bespoke it not .
I would not have him miscarry for the half of my dowry .
The will , the will !
The king is full of grace and fair regard .
If the ill spirit have so fair a house , Good things will strive to dwell with 't .
Music , hark .
Now all labor Mars what it does .
I'll end my exhortation after dinner .
I have a letter guessingly set down , Which came from one that's of a neutral heart , And not from one opposed .
Go bid the priests do present sacrifice And bring me their opinions of success .
And let my liver rather heat with wine Than my heart cool with mortifying groans .
Farewell .
I do remember in this shepherd boy Some lively touches of my daughter's favor .
Well , my good lord , I'll do 't .
A sweeter and a Lovellier gentleman , Framed in the prodigality of nature , Young , valiant , wise , and , no doubt , right royal , The spacious world can not again afford .
Conceit , more rich in matter than in words , Brags of his substance , not of ornament .
What do you think Of marching to Philippi presently ?
If Caesar had stabbed their mothers they would have done no less .
Thisbe ?
That's a question .
I will be flesh and blood , For there was never yet philosopher That could endure the toothache patiently , However they have writ the style of gods And made a push at chance and sufferance .
He is arrived .
I say , by sorcery he got this isle .
First , of my word !
Sorrow breaks seasons and reposing hours , Makes the night morning , and the noontide night .
He is addressed .
He that keeps nor crust nor crumb , Weary of all , shall want some .
Speak , Pyramus. , Thisbe , stand forth .
Indeed , they say the senators tomorrow Mean to establish Caesar as a king , And he shall wear his crown by sea and land In every place save here in Italy .
Lie thou there .
Ready .
I am the son of Marcus Cato , ho !
Here's Lucentio , right son to the right Vincentio , That have by marriage made thy daughter mine While counterfeit supposes bleared thine eyne .
By Janus , I think no .
My lord , I hold my life as dear as you do yours , And never in my days , I do protest , Was it so precious to me as 'tis now .
O good Antonio , forgive me your trouble .
Hence !
Thou thinkest I am in sport .
Why does the world report that Kate doth limp ?
Some others search .
And for my love I pray you wrong me not .
Ay , Celia , we stayed her for your sake .
I , thus neglecting worldly ends , all dedicated To closeness and the bettering of my mind With that which , but by being so retired , O'erprized all popular rate , in my false brother Awaked an evil nature .
He is not lolling on a lewd love bed , But on his knees at meditation ; Not dallying with a brace of courtesans , But meditating with two deep divines ; Not sleeping , to engross his idle body , But praying , to enrich his watchful soul .
God be with you .
Hence , prating peasant !
I am poisoned .
What lawful quest have given their verdict up Unto the frowning judge ?
It is indifferent cold , my lord , indeed .
I am your host .
I know it well , sir .
I think I did , sir .
O , reason not the need !
And I for Rosalind .
You must not stay here longer .
Thy husband knew it all .
Tis certain there's not a boy left alive , and the cowardly rascals that ran from the battle ha ' done this slaughter .
Impatient of my absence , And grief that young Octavius with Mark Antony Have made themselves so strong , for with her death That tidings came , with this she fell distract And , her attendants absent , swallowed fire .
And then he offered it the third time .
O sinful thought !
One aloof stand sentinel .
Oh , fie , fie , fie !
Oh , by whom ?
Even what it please my lord that shall become him .
The rest march on with me .
My estate is very low .
For Michael Cassio , I dare be sworn , I think , that he is honest .
Truly , an obedient lady .
How now ?
No , but to the gate , and there will the devil meet me like an old cuckold with horns on his head , and say , "Get you to heaven , Beatrice , get you to heaven ; here's no place for you maids." So deliver I up my apes and away to Saint Peter .
Fie , what a question's that If thou wert near a lewd interpreter !
What do you mean ?
Do not you meddle .
Adieu .
Treason !
And for I know she taketh most delight In music , instruments , and poetry , Schoolmasters will I keep within my house , Fit to instruct her youth .
Strangle her in her bed , even the bed she hath contaminated .
Master Malvolio ?
Wilt thou not answer , man ?
Leave me , Iago .
Is 't possible , friend Litio , that mistress Bianca Doth fancy any other but Lucentio ?
Take but good note , and you shall see in him The triple pillar of the world transformed Into a strumpet's fool .
Benedick , didst thou note the daughter of Signior Leonato ?
Why , that's my dainty Ariel .
Give me thy hand , Roderigo .
You bring me out .
Clubs , bills , and partisans !
They told me I was everything .
O brave touch !
I hear it now above me .
Look you , if you take the matter otherwise than is meant , Captain Macmorris , peradventure I shall think you do not use me with that affability as , in discretion , you ought to use me , look you , being as good a man as yourself , both in the disciplines of war and in the derivation of my birth and in other particularities .
Most sincerely .
Doing is activity , and he will still be doing .
Indeed , I should have asked thee that before .
A truant disposition , good my lord .
Sir , I never loved you much , but I ha' praised ye When you have well deserved ten times as much As I have said you did .
Adieu , noble Agrippa .
What are these faces ?
My matter hath no voice , lady , but to your own most pregnant and vouchsafed ear .
Farewell , good Signior Love .
And of the heat of the ginger .
Where they feared the death , they have borne life away ; and where they would be safe , they perish .
Bloody , bawdy villain !
Whose tongue ?
Sweet lady , ho , ho .
Most welcome home !
But if the cause be not good , the king himself hath a heavy reckoning to make , when all those legs and arms and heads , chopped off in a battle , shall join together at the latter day , and cry all , "We died at such a place , " some swearing , some crying for a surgeon , some upon their wives left poor behind them , some upon the debts they owe , some upon their children rawly left .
Where's thy drum ?
I am none of his skains-mates .
You or any man living may be drunk at a time , man .
Oh , noble weakness !
As good cause as one would desire .
The gods defend him from so great a shame !
If a man's brains were in 's heels , were 't not in danger of kibes ?
Did I not bid thee meet me in the park And bring along these rascal knaves with thee ?
What says the silver with her virgin hue ?
How goes 't ?
Make your best use of this .
Sweet now , silence .
How fearful And dizzy 'tis to cast one's eyes so low !
Good Master Fabian , grant me another request .
What news ?
By the pricking of my thumbs , Something wicked this way comes .
Sweet Sir Toby , be patient for tonight .
It shall to the barber's , with your beard. , Prithee , say on .
Twas yet some comfort When misery could beguile the tyrant's rage And frustrate his proud will .
You shall have ransom .
Dat it is not be de fashion pour les ladies of France , I can not tell wat is To kiss .
For I am Trinculo , be not afeard , thy good friend Trinculo .
Much is breeding Which , like the courser's hair , hath yet but life , And not a serpent's poison .
Come , some music !
Oh , speak of that .
I pray , sir , tell me , is it possible That love should of a sudden take such hold ?
God give him joy !
I pray you , rise .
O rude unthankfulness !
Make we our march towards Birnam .
But give me your hand , Menas .
Thou shalt be whipped with wire and stewed in brine , Smarting in ling'ring pickle !
What a life is this That your poor friends must woo your company ?
No , I went round to work , And my young mistress thus I did bespeak : "Lord Hamlet is a prince out of thy star .
Apothecary !
Poor lady , she'll run mad When she shall lack it .
And me too , good Lord !
O coward conscience , how dost thou afflict me !
Tis time I should inform thee farther .
The law allows it , and the court awards it .
Farewell till then .
He hath a heart as sound as a bell , and his tongue is the clapper , for what his heart thinks , his tongue speaks .
The same indeed , a very valiant fellow .
Or blesse was 't we did ?
Where hast thou been , sister ?
And this cuff was but to knock at your ear and beseech list'ning .
Why art thou here , Come from the farthest step of India ?
Twas where you wooed the gentlewoman so well .
O Caesar !
Come in , tailor .
And when I rear my hand , do you the like , To fall it on Gonzalo .
And here am I , and wood within this wood , Because I can not meet my Hermia .
Eight score eight hours ?
The good years shall devour them , flesh and fell , Ere they shall make us weep .
The folly of this island .
Nothing at all .
Observe him , for the love of mockery , for I know this letter will make a contemplative idiot of him .
No hope that way is Another way so high a hope that even Ambition can not pierce a wink beyond , But doubt discovery there .
Well aimed of such a young one .
I am to pray you not to strain my speech To grosser issues nor to larger reach Than to suspicion .
Sole monarch of the universal earth , Oh , what a beast was I to chide at him !
What is it thou didst say ?
Give him a halter .
Drink , servant-monster , when I bid thee .
Ah , my good lord , what have I seen tonight !
Besides , there is no king , be his cause never so spotless , if it come to the arbitrament of swords , can try it out with all unspotted soldiers .
This green plot shall be our stage , this hawthorn-brake our tiring-house , and we will do it in action as we will do it before the duke .
Take him on the costard with the hilts of thy sword , and then throw him into the malmsey butt in the next room .
It hath no tongue to vex you .
Go to , woman , Throw your vile guesses in the devil's teeth From whence you have them .
Are you yet determined Today to marry with my brother's daughter ?
If he awake , From toe to crown he'll fill our skins with pinches , Make us strange stuff .
No , It is thyself , mine own self's better part , Mine eye's clear eye , my dear heart's dearer heart , My food , my fortune , and my sweet hope's aim , My sole earth's heaven , and my heaven's claim .
Keep your word , Phoebe , that you'll marry me Or else , refusing me , to wed this shepherd .
Ourselves we do not owe .
If he can not , let the botcher mend him .
After a little time , I'll beat him too .
This is more strange Than such a murder is .
How many months Do you desire ?
He will do all in all as Hastings doth .
Come , bid me do anything for thee .
If all the devils of hell be drawn in little , and Legion himself possessed him , yet I'll speak to him .
Tis much he dares , And to that dauntless temper of his mind He hath a wisdom that doth guide his valor To act in safety .
Run to your houses , fall upon your knees , Pray to the gods to intermit the plague That needs must light on this ingratitude .
Oh , thereby hangs a tail .
Those that are good manners at the court are as ridiculous in the country as the behavior of the country is most mockable at the court .
Signor Antonio , many a time and oft In the Rialto you have rated me About my moneys and my usances .
Edmund , farewell .
I doubt some danger does approach you nearly .
I can tell what thou wouldst do .
Such a one Am I to fear , or none .
Good dawning to thee , friend .
Rosalind of a better leer than you .
Thy slander hath gone through and through her heart , And she lies buried with her ancestors , Oh , in a tomb where never scandal slept Save this of hers , framed by thy villainy .
How much low peasantry would then be gleaned From the true seed of honor !
I know 't , my sister's .
Shall I say to Caesar What you require of him ?
Our fraughtage , sir , I have conveyed aboard , and I have bought The oil , the balsamum and aqua vitae .
Ah , for my husband , for my dear lord Edward !
Do but now promise , Kate , you will endeavor for your French part of such a boy ; and for my English moiety take the word of a king and a bachelor .
The money that you owe me for the chain .
I'll look to like if looking liking move .
Therefore I pray you That to our sister you do make return .
Why then I think Cassio's an honest man .
Hail to your grace .
And I .
Is he not here ?
Madam , in Rome .
I was born free as Caesar .
I will , my lord .
I can behold no longer .
When in that moment so it came to pass , Titania waked and straightway loved an ass .
I never knew woman love man so .
Then you will bring the chain to her yourself .
Bid him therefore consider of his ransom , which must proportion the losses we have borne , the subjects we have lost , the disgrace we have digested , which , in weight to reanswer , his pettiness would bow under .
My wayward husband hath a hundred times
For indeed , who would set his wit to so foolish a bird ?
I am .
There is no other shelter hereabouts .
Complain unto the Duke of this indignity .
And when was he wont to wash his face ?
Tis heavy night , These may be counterfeits .
O Tranio , till I found it to be true , I never thought it possible or likely .
Death lies on her like an untimely frost Upon the sweetest flower of all the field .
Our army shall In solemn show attend this funeral , And then to Rome .
If so , be patient , sister .
If not , he's plain .
Sirrah , come hither : 'tis no time to jest , And therefore frame your manners to the time .
He longs to see your head .
His hour is almost past .
Cast it off !
My father charged you in his will to give me good education .
For there is not a more fearful wildfowl than your lion living .
Well then , sustain me .
Use lenity , sweet chuck .
Young son , it argues a distempered head So soon to bid good morrow to thy bed .
Come on .
Nay , I am sure it is , Volumnius .
I will , my lord .
You have done well , That men must lay their murders on your neck .
I am for thee straight .
Ay , that Petruchio came .
You wrong me , Signior Gremio .
I take no pleasure In aught an eunuch has .
Iago , who began 't ?
Where is the thousand marks thou hadst of me ?
Romeo !
What's your will ?
The manner of their deaths ?
Well .
You are well fleshed .
Put money enough in your purse .
Of a snail ?
Say to the king I would attend his leisure For a few words .
It were , my lord , a hard condition for a maid to consign to .
Twas no need , I trow , To bid me trudge .
A lioness hath whelped in the streets , And graves have yawned and yielded up their dead .
Antonio , O my dear Antonio !
O heavens !
Do you know them ?
We see how mortal an unkindness is to them .
If thou wilt needs damn thyself , do it a more delicate way than drowning .
Truly , I have him , but I would not be the party that should desire you to touch him , for his biting is immortal .
Wast ever in court , shepherd ?
True , noble prince .
Arise .
Go you and prepare Aliena , for look you , here comes my Rosalind .
Tis called the evil .
Why , madam , have I offered love for this , To be so flouted in this royal presence ?
Upon record , my gracious lord .
Yea , even I alone .
Why he more than another ?
Tis better , sir , to be brief than tedious. , Let him see our commission , and talk no more .
Why , that was he .
I'll not deny him anything I have , No , not my body , nor my husband's bed .
What , are you mad that you do reason so ?
There !
What , for a counter , would I do but good ?
Here comes the Prince and Claudio .
By heaven , I will acquaint his majesty With those gross taunts that oft I have endured .
O Pomfret , Pomfret !
Fare you well .
If thou wert my fool , nuncle , I'd have thee beaten for being old before thy time .
Be wary , then .
Nym , thou hast spoke the right .
I bear no hatred , blessed man , for , lo , My intercession likewise steads my foe .
I commend your pains , And every one shall share i ' th ' gains .
None , Brutus , none .
But that my Lady Beatrice should know me , and not know me !
Bless thee from whirlwinds , star-blasting , and taking !
How low am I , thou painted maypole ?
Known unto these , and to myself disguised !
Fiery" ?
I am constant to my purpose .
And when I have stol'n upon these sons-in-law , Then , kill , kill , kill , kill , kill , kill !
That I did love the Moor to live with him , My downright violence and storm of fortunes May trumpet to the world .
I love thee not , therefore pursue me not .
Oh , who hath done this deed ?
I am cut to th ' brains .
You are unkind , Demetrius .
Hold , sir , here's my purse .
I'll not fight with thee .
Good my mouse of virtue , answer me .
Your features , Lord warrant us !
I think it is the weakness of mine eyes That shapes this monstrous apparition .
Caesar's better parts Shall be crowned in Brutus !
Therefore our everlasting farewell take .
If justice can not tame you , she shall ne'er weigh more reasons in her balance .
Alas , that they are so , To die even when they to perfection grow !

Great God of heaven , say amen to all !
The children live whose fathers thou hast slaughtered , Ungoverned youth , to wail it in their age ; The parents live whose children thou hast butchered , Old barren plants , to wail it with their age .
Think you to walk forth ?
Doth it ?
Warrant thee , my man's as true as steel .
And , hark !
Death , in guerdon of her wrongs , Gives her fame which never dies .

Sir , there is especial commission come from Venice to depute Cassio in Othello's place .
Hang thou there upon the tomb , Praising her when I am dumb .
Sir , pardon me in what I have to say .
To threaten me with death is most unlawful .

If you will come to me , For now I spy a danger , I entreat you To bring but five and twenty .
Who knows he is ?
Then belike my children shall have no names .
Tis well .

Sweet lady , you have given me life and living .
I charge you , get you home .
Who knows not that the gentle duke is dead ?
The players can not keep counsel .
Go , Lovell , with all speed to Doctor Shaw .
Now your jest is earnest .
Where are the vile beginners of this fray ?
Farewell the plumed troops and the big wars That makes ambition virtue !
Whereon old Norway , overcome with joy ,
These are now the fashion , and so berattle the common stages , so they call them , that many wearing rapiers are afraid of goose quills and dare scarce come thither .

Come , your answer in broken music , for thy voice is music and thy English broken .
Ghastly looks Are at my service , like enforced smiles , And both are ready in their offices , At any time to grace my stratagems .
Wherefore to Dover , sir ?
Trust me , I take him for the better dog .
I pray you mar no more trees with writing love songs in their barks .
Know , sir , that I Will not wait pinioned at your master's court , Nor once be chastised with the sober eye Of dull Octavia .

A deed without a name .
Farewell to you. , And you. , And you , Volumnius .
Now to that name my courage prove my title !
Be comforted , dear madam .
Sweet friends , your patience for my long abode .
I have much to do But to go hang my head all at one side And sing it like poor Barbary .
So please you , What says the fellow there ?
Say that I lingered with you at your shop To see the making of her carcanet , And that tomorrow you will bring it home .
On their sustaining garments not a blemish , But fresher than before .
I knew a wench married in an afternoon as she went to the garden for parsley to stuff a rabbit , and so may you , sir .
Rather approach'd too late !
What's that good for ?
No , for I hold him to be unworthy of his place that does those things .
That "sort" was well fished for .
And you too , sir .
You know me well , and herein spend but time To wind about my love with circumstance .
My creditors grow cruel .
Do not say so , my lord .
The lady protests too much , methinks .
Descend , for you must be my torchbearer .
I pray you , look upon her .
Good morrow , Lieutenant Bardolph .
How now , Malvolio !
Yes , I have gained my experience .
The devil damn thee black , thou cream-faced loon !
Farewell .

What do you mean ?
No , you shall paint when you are old .
My liege , I am advised what I say , Neither disturbed with the effect of wine , Nor heady-rash , provoked with raging ire , Albeit my wrongs might make one wiser mad .
Then I'll be brief .
Before the eyes of both our armies here , Which should perceive nothing but love from us , Let us not wrangle .
First , if all obstacles were cut away And that my path were even to the crown As the ripe revenue and due of birth , Yet so much is my poverty of spirit , So mighty and so many my defects , That I would rather hide me from my greatness , Being a bark to brook no mighty sea , Than in my greatness covet to be hid And in the vapor of my glory smothered .
Kindness in women , not their beauteous looks , Shall win my love , and so I take my leave , In resolution as I swore before .
Now will I to the chink , To spy an I can hear my Thisbe's face .
Tis pity of him .
Away !
Sir Toby , madam , your kinsman .
I know I can do it .
It is not well done , mark you now , to take the tales out of my mouth ere it is made and finished .
There is something else .
Let me comply with you in this garb , lest my extent to the players , which , I tell you , must show fairly outwards , should more appear like entertainment than yours .
Go on before .
Hold little faith , though thou hast too much fear .
I am here already , sir .
But life itself , my wife , and all the world Are not with me esteemed above thy life .
Look , sir , I bleed .
Believe me , lord , I think he can not choose .
But , as I said , On Lammas Eve at night shall she be fourteen .
In the way of argument , look you , and friendly communication , partly to satisfy my opinion , and partly for the satisfaction , look you , of my mind , as touching the direction of the military discipline , that is the point .
To him , Sir Topas .
Didst thou give all to thy two daughters , and art thou come to this ?
Why , sir , cobble you .
Let me have surgeons .
Ay , husband .
That's her torment .
Right joyous are we to behold your face , Most worthy brother England .
Good sister , let us dine and never fret .
Stay till I have read the letter .
The one I'll stay , the other stayeth me .
Poor Ophelia Divided from herself and her fair judgment , Without the which we are pictures , or mere beasts .
Look where she comes .
Out o ' tune , sir .
What sayest thou ?
Well , be it so .
Exchange forgiveness with me , noble Hamlet .
If not , an it would please you to take leave of her , she is very willing to bid you farewell .

I prithee , hear me speak .
Did my father strike my gentleman For chiding of his fool ?

The king hath granted every article , His daughter first , and , in sequel , all , According to their firm proposed natures .
Lord , how it looks about !

Why , sir , what's your conceit in that ?
You are welcome .
He that plays the king shall be welcome .
My wife killed too ?
Swear by your double self , And there's an oath of credit !
I saw thee late at the Count Orsino's .
God in heaven bless her !
What two crowns shall they be ?

So to them both .

I know not what to say .
Which of them shall I take ?
Pray , what do you think is his name ?
All strange and terrible events are welcome , But comforts we despise .
Her worth being mounted on the wind , Through all the world bears Rosalind .
Natures of such deep trust we shall much need .
Alas , too soon We came aboard .

Le chien est retourne a son propre vomissement , et la truie lavee au bourbier." Thou mak'st use of anything .
Why , and I trust I may go too , may I not ?

So well thy words become thee as thy wounds ; They smack of honor both .
Ay , my lord , an 't please you .
I have sent for these strawberries .
Lord of his fortunes he salutes thee , and Requires to live in Egypt ; which not granted , He lessens his requests , and to thee sues To let him breathe between the heavens and earth A private man in Athens .

I am bound to your niece , sir .
No passage ?
No , believe me .
You are welcome .
We must be married , or we must live in bawdry. , Farewell , good Master Oliver , not 'T is no matter .
So , again , good night .
More light and light it grows .
Come , Dromio , come , these jests are out of season .
Thou didst usurp my place , and dost thou not Usurp the just proportion of my sorrow ?
Come , go with me ; Under our tents I'll play the eavesdropper To see if any mean to shrink from me .
Death of one person can be paid but once , And that she has discharged .
Therefore perpend , my princess , and give ear .

He knows not the stop .
Till Birnam Wood remove to Dunsinane I can not taint with fear .

Most happy !
Ha ?
Why , here begins his morning story right ; These two Antipholuses , these two so like , And these two Dromios , one in semblance , Besides her urging of her wreck at sea , These are the parents to these children , Which accidentally are met together .

You best know the place .
Far more , far more , to you do I decline .

Well are you welcome to the open air .
The Moor's abused by some most villainous knave , Some base notorious knave , some scurvy fellow .
Cheerly , good Adam .
It seems not meet , nor wholesome to my place , To be producted ( as , if I stay , I shall ) Against the Moor .
Good .
What is this same ?
I'll drink for you .

Fare thee well .
But did you not request to have it cut ?
Better Macbeth Than such an one to reign .
Nay then , come on , and take the chance of anger .
Hark !
I warrant you , my lord .
God give your Grace good rest .
And wherefore doth Lysander Deny your love , so rich within his soul , And tender me , forsooth , affection , But by your setting on , by your consent ?
The foul fiend follows me !
I charge thee , tempt me not .
What , shall I groan and tell thee ?
But fear not yet To take upon you what is yours .
This is the day which , in King Edward's time , I wished might fall on me when I was found False to his children and his wife's allies .
Kind Tyrrel , am I happy in thy news ?
Not one , my lord .

Welcome to Cyprus .
Peace be with Burgundy .
Why then , resolve me whether you will or no .
Well , what worst ?

Get him to bed , and let his hurt be looked to .
Gentlemen , you are welcome to Elsinore .
What is your will ?
The king mine uncle is to blame for it .

He that sweetest rose will find Must find love's prick , and Rosalind .
My master will be here ere morning .
I'll slit the villain's nose that would have sent me to the jail .
He is my prisoner , and you shall not have him .

First he denied you had in him no right .
Say to the king the knowledge of the broil As thou didst leave it .

I can tell you it will serve you to mend your shoes .
Come hither , Leonato .
There was blow for blow .
Come on .
Double , double toil and trouble , Fire burn and cauldron bubble .
It's nine o'clock .
This doth not so , for she divideth us .
That I disdain .
Do you mark that ?
Bring me to Antony .
God ye good e'en , fair gentlewoman .
Content with Hermia ?
My visor is Philemon's roof ; within the house is Jove .
Well , the beginning that is dead and buried .
Thanks , you the valiant of this warlike isle That so approve the Moor .
The best in this kind are but shadows , and the worst are no worse if imagination amend them .
Young Edward lives ; think now what I would speak .
My lord , I have remembrances of yours That I have longed long to redeliver .
Within this half hour will he be asleep .
I rest much bounden to you .
I thought so then , I'll kill myself for grief .
Of fighting men they have full threescore thousand .
O ceremony , show me but thy worth !
Go thou with me , and let me counsel thee .
What say you ?

Gone ?
I will not do thee so much wrong to wake thee .
Caesar , beware of Brutus .
Though for myself alone I would not be ambitious in my wish To wish myself much better , yet for you I would be trebled twenty times myself , A thousand times more fair , ten thousand times more rich , That only to stand high in your account I might in virtue , beauties , livings , friends Exceed account .

Let me hear from you .
An you love me , let's do 't .
Very good .

Well then , the peace which you before so urged Lies in his answer .
So it appears by that I have to say .
Bid them move away .
And so am I for Rosalind .
Sir , I bade them take away you .
When the mind's free , The body's delicate .
What , Octavia ?
O God , did Romeo's hand shed Tybalt's blood ?
It is a branch and parcel of mine oath , A charitable duty of my order .
Thou liest .
I remember when I was in love I broke my sword upon a stone and bid him take that for coming a- night to Jane Smile .
Let me play the lion too .
Here comes the lady .
Shylock , do you hear ?
You mock me , sir .
Why , so didst thou .
I pray you , uncle , give me this dagger .
That do I long to hear .
Madam ?
Good sir ,
Yes , marry , sir .
This torture should be roared in dismal hell .
In your bad strokes , Brutus , you give good words .
I heard myself proclaimed , And by the happy hollow of a tree Escaped the hunt .
No , not a grize .
Give me your blessing .
Go you down that way towards the Capitol .
No , my lord , unless I might have another for working days .
The Marshal of France , Monsieur la Far .
What news more ?
My lord , I did intend it .
Do not talk to me , Emilia .

When I have plucked thy rose I can not give it vital growth again , It must needs wither .
Welcome , lady .
Come , shall we go and kill us venison ?
Bring it to that , The gold I give thee will I melt and pour Down thy ill-uttering throat .
I protest I love thee .
No , not a denier .
Ay , my good lord .
A fiend like thee might bear my soul to hell .
Get thee gone , but do it .
The first interr'gatory That my Nerissa shall be sworn on is Whether till the next night she had rather stay , Or go to bed now , being two hours to day .
To the Elephant .
It is the most impenetrable cur That ever kept with men .

Most noble brother , you have done me wrong .
Let him let the matter slip , and I'll give him my horse , gray Capilet .
Is there not charms By which the property of youth and maidhood May be abused ?
Dromio , what stuff of mine hast thou embarked ?
I may not breathe my censure What he might be .
All comfort that the dark night can afford Be to thy person , noble father-in-law .
Vex not his prescience .
Yes , gracious madam .
Let his shames quickly Drive him to Rome .
I will forestall their repair hither and say you are not fit .
Well , think of marriage now .
Our fortune lies Upon this jump .
I am bound by oath , and therefore pardon me .
I think the policy of that purpose made more in the marriage than the love of the parties .
Early tomorrow will we rise and hence .
Did your letters pierce the queen to any demonstration of grief ?
Go seek him out , speak fair , and bring the body Into the chapel .
It is too true an evil .
Consent to swear .
There , My music playing far off , I will betray Tawny-finned fishes .
A hundred marks , my Kate does put her down .
I will possess you of that ship and treasure .
Put on my crown .
I thank thee .
What will become of this ?
And badest me bury love .
Towards Chertsey , noble lord ?
What , we have many goodly days to see !
But do not go with it .
I'll ride home tomorrow , Sir Toby .
Did you ?
Hang him , Jack !
Why , there , there , there , there !
Hold off your hands .
And I'll still stay , to have thee still forget , Forgetting any other home but this .
Speak .
She were an excellent wife for Benedict .
How now , sir ?
Good Volumnius , Thou know'st that we two went to school together .
Thou know'st we work by wit and not by witchcraft , And wit depends on dilatory time .
She is of so free , so kind , so apt , so blessed a disposition , she holds it a vice in her goodness not to do more than she is requested .
As I remember , this should be the house .
Say , what ?
Come , shall we about it ?
I find not Myself disposed to sleep .
And then , as we have ta'en the sacrament , We will unite the white rose and the red .
They are coming to the play .
That is because the traitor murderer lives .
Silence awhile. , Robin , take off this head. , Titania , music call , and strike more dead Than common sleep of all these five the sense .
Do not presume too much upon my love .
Well , we will leave you then till dinnertime .
Here , sir !
Did this companion with the saffron face Revel and feast it at my house today Whilst upon me the guilty doors were shut And I denied to enter in my house ?
Ay , ay , three thousand ducats .
Angels are bright still , though the brightest fell .
This is a fellow of the selfsame color Our sister speaks of. , Come , bring away the stocks !
A fair name .
Why , here is the note of the fashion to testify .
Keep peace , upon your lives .
Now in faith , Gratiano , You give your wife too unkind a cause of grief .
Gentlemen , forward to the bridal dinner .
But better service have I never done you Than now to bid you hold .
Good meat , sir , is common ; that every churl affords .
But did you ever tell him she was false ?
I know his gait , 'tis he. , Villain , thou diest !
Shall I tell you why ?
Said he not so ?
And when he saw my best alarumed spirits , Bold in the quarrel's right , roused to the encounter , Or whether ghasted by the noise I made , Full suddenly he fled .
What will you do with 't , that you have been so earnest To have me filch it ?
Most noble Antony !
Fare you well .
I stretch it out for that word "broad , " which , added to the goose , proves thee far and wide a broad goose .
Bate , I beseech you , widow Dido .
Hark thee , Clitus .
Light is an effect of fire , and fire will burn : ergo , light wenches will burn .
Farewell , everyone .
I think we are too bold upon your rest .
Strike , I say !
I can not think my sister in the least Would fail her obligation .
Thou art a cobbler , art thou ?
I am sorry to hear this .
Wherein hath Caesar thus deserved your loves ?
Follow , I pray you .
Woe that too late repents ! , Is it your will ?
He was not merry , Which seemed to tell them his remembrance lay In Egypt with his joy , but between both .
I'll venture so much of my hawk or hound , But twenty times so much upon my wife .
My husband is on earth , my faith in heaven .
Look to 't .
Pray you , go with us .
Juliet ! , Fast , I warrant her , she. , Why , lamb !
Come to me , that of this I may speak more .
It came even from the heart of , oh , she's dead !
I would we were well rid of this knavery .
Hold , take my sword .
That's the next to do .
Why , art thou mad , old fellow ?
My father had a daughter loved a man As it might be , perhaps , were I a woman , I should your lordship .
Go apart , Adam , and thou shalt hear how he will shake me up .
As he shall smile , Othello shall go mad .
It is .
Jove , I thank thee !
Your wife would give you little thanks for that If she were by to hear you make the offer .
Good morrow , Caesar .
But these offers , Which serve not for his vantage , he shakes off , And so should you .
Never alone Did the king sigh , but with a general groan .
So will it , madam till I lie with you .
If we , with thrice such powers left at home , Can not defend our own doors from the dog , Let us be worried , and our nation lose The name of hardiness and policy .
Thou hast by moonlight at her window sung With feigning voice verses of feigning love , And stol'n the impression of her fantasy With bracelets of thy hair , rings , gauds , conceits , Knacks , trifles , nosegays , sweetmeats , messengers Of strong prevailment in unhardened youth .
Speak low if you speak love .
Filths savor but themselves .
Swords out , and tilting one at other's breasts In opposition bloody .
It is my arm .
My best way is to creep under his gaberdine .
But lend it rather to thine enemy , Who , if he break , thou mayst with better face Exact the penalty .
Here it is , I think .
I think of as many matters as he , but I give heaven thanks and make no boast of them .
Or if thou hast uphoarded in thy life Extorted treasure in the womb of earth , For which , they say , you spirits oft walk in death , Speak of it .
Farewell .
Had you such leisure in the time of death To gaze upon the secrets of the deep ?
Yes , Captain , but with this acknowledgement : That God fought for us .
Come to me , Tyrrel , soon at after-supper , When thou shalt tell the process of their death .
Lady !
Who , I , my lord ?
It seems to me That yet we sleep , we dream .
Seafaring men , sir .
Let me say "Amen" betimes , lest the devil cross my prayer , for here he comes in the likeness of a Jew .
Marry , patience , Or I shall say you are all in all in spleen , And nothing of a man .
No , no , no , no !
Kind gentlemen , let's go see poor Cassio dressed. , Come , mistress , you must tell 's another tale .
My breath and blood !
All my pretty ones ?
Is 't not denounced against us ?
Ay , if you dare do yourself a profit and a right .
So may you lose your arms .
Your Majesty , hear now , saving your Majesty's manhood , what an arrant , rascally , beggarly , lousy knave it is .
Nothing but this : your true love for my master .
You have killed a sweet lady , and her death shall fall heavy on you .
That is the way to make her scorn you still .
Here comes young Master Ganymede , my new mistress's brother .
O horror , horror , horror !
Your wives , your daughters , Your matrons , and your maids could not fill up The cistern of my lust , and my desire All continent impediments would o'erbear That did oppose my will .
Have you not set mine honor at the stake , And baited it with all the unmuzzled thoughts That tyrannous heart can think ?
We will spare for no wit , I warrant you .
Most miserable hour that e'er time saw In lasting labor of his pilgrimage .
The king's a-bed .
The soul and body rive not more in parting Than greatness going off .
Nor stony tower , nor walls of beaten brass , Nor airless dungeon , nor strong links of iron Can be retentive to the strength of spirit .
We are bound to the like .
Now , Roderigo , Where didst thou see her ? , Oh , unhappy girl ! , With the Moor , say'st thou ? , Who would be a father ? , How didst thou know 'twas she ? , Oh , she deceives me Past thought ! , What said she to you ? , Get more tapers , Raise all my kindred .
Quail , crush , conclude , and quell !
Why , there's no remedy .
Ay , madam .
Hath he provided this music ?
Their course of love , the tidings of her death .
And , you know , his means , If he improve them , may well stretch so far As to annoy us all ; which to prevent , Let Antony and Caesar fall together .
Therefore , Go , clear thy crystals. , Yoke-fellows in arms , Let us to France , like horse-leeches , my boys , To suck , to suck , the very blood to suck .
Your eldest daughters have fordone themselves , And desperately are dead .

What watchful cares do interpose themselves Betwixt your eyes and night ?
Are you sure of that ?
To be your fellow You may deny me , but I'll be your servant Whether you will or no .
Soft , Caesar .
Who maintains 'em ?
Clubs can not part them .
It must be so , for miracles are ceased , And therefore we must needs admit the means How things are perfected .
Blistered be thy tongue For such a wish !
Tis nine o'clock .
Thou art the best o ' th ' cutthroats : Yet he's good that did the like for Fleance .
It is the rival of my love .
But well and free , If thou so yield him , there is gold , and here My bluest veins to kiss , a hand that kings Have lipped , and trembled kissing .

Friends , come hither .
I shall deliver so .
My Lord of Warwick and my brother Gloucester , Follow Fluellen closely at the heels .
And how cam'st thou hither ?
I have done my work ill , friends .
He hath the jewel of my life in hold , His youngest daughter , beautiful Bianca , And her withholds from me and other more , Suitors to her and rivals in my love , Supposing it a thing impossible , For those defects I have before rehearsed , That ever Katherina will be wooed .
My best endeavours shall be done herein .
No marrying 'mong his subjects ?
O me , O me !
Nothing certainer .
What have you done ?

I hope he is much grown since last I saw him .
Sweet masters , be patient .
Softly , my masters .
Never came poison from so sweet a place .
No , no , forsooth , I dare not for my life .
That eye my daughter lent her ; 'tis most true .
Past the mid season .
Tis pitiful , but yet Iago knows That she with Cassio hath the act of shame A thousand times committed .
Hath it not , boy ?

Search every acre in the high-grown field , And bring him to our eye .
For mine own part , I shall be glad to learn of noble men .
One knocks .
He is a dreamer .
These couchings and these lowly courtesies Might fire the blood of ordinary men And turn preordinance and first decree Into the law of children .
He's a good fellow , I can tell you that .
If consequence do but approve my dream My boat sails freely , both with wind and stream .
Oh , thou art deceived .
What are you then determined to do ?
Foolish curs , that run winking into the mouth of a Russian bear and have their heads crushed like rotten apples .
But are you so much in love as your rhymes speak ?
It might have since been answered in repaying What we took from them , which , for traffic's sake , Most of our city did .
Liar and slave !
Where ?
You must translate .
What , Brutus ?
It makes me mad .
There , sir , stop .
Get you to your lord .
This jest shall cost me some expense .
Tell me this , I pray : Where have you left the money that I gave you ?
Dost thou hear , lady ?
You have trained me like a peasant , obscuring and hiding from me all gentlemanlike qualities .
A sight most pitiful in the meanest wretch , Past speaking of in a king .
Or stole it , rather .
I can not tell .
Fear not , my lord .
Tush , Gremio .
Say that she frown ; I'll say she looks as clear As morning roses newly washed with dew .

O bitter consequence That Edward still should live "true noble prince" !
Nay , we will slink away in supper time , Disguise us at my lodging , and return , All in an hour .
Nor I neither .
Go sleep , and hear us .
Treason and murder ever kept together As two yoke-devils sworn to either's purpose , Working so grossly in a natural cause That admiration did not whoop at them .
Speak this no more .
I will not hurt him .
Speak .
By this marriage , All little jealousies , which now seem great , And all great fears , which now import their dangers , Would then be nothing .
Take the fool away .
What ?
But I have heard him oft maintain it to be fit that , sons at perfect age and fathers declined , the father should be as ward to the son , and the son manage his revenue .
But , for mine own part , it was Greek to me .
I have full cause of weeping , but this heart Shall break into a hundred thousand flaws , Or ere I'll weep. , O Fool , I shall go mad !
Heavens keep him from these beasts !
Art thou a man ?
A gentle scroll .
My father's spirit in arms .
I tax not you , you elements , with unkindness .
O God !
I would I knew thy heart .
The little strength that I have , I would it were with you .
Lo thee !
I know the hand .
An evil soul producing holy witness Is like a villain with a smiling cheek , A goodly apple rotten at the heart .
What said he ?
I'll put myself in poor and mean attire And with a kind of umber smirch my face .
I found it in my chamber , And he himself confessed but even now That there he dropped it for a special purpose Which wrought to his desire .
So in the world .
Tremblingly she stood And on the sudden dropped .
Her eye discourses .
The sum of all I can , I have disclosed .
Ay , madam , well , for I was bred and born Not three hours ' travel from this very place .
Nay , gentlemen , prepare not to be gone .
Then comes my fit again .
No , 'tis not so deep as a well nor so wide as a church-door , but 'tis enough , 'twill serve .
I will stop your mouth .
Here I kneel : If e'er my will did trespass 'gainst his love , Either in discourse of thought or actual deed , Or that mine eyes , mine ears , or any sense , Delighted them , or any other form , Or that I do not yet , and ever did ,
Sir , know you this glove ?

Thieves !
Speakest thou from thy heart ?
Right glad I am he was not at this fray .
It is .
Good words are better than bad strokes , Octavius .
Thanks , dear my lord .
Thou dar'st as well be hanged .
Indeed ?
He hath not told his thought to the king ?
Why , then , we kill all our women .
What should we say , my lord ?
And thus thy fall hath left a kind of blot To mark the full-fraught man and best endued With some suspicion .
Go to , you are too shrewd .
Here , my lord .

If he do bleed , I'll gild the faces of the grooms withal , For it must seem their guilt .
For what purpose , love ?

And let us do it with no show of fear , No , with no more than if we heard that England Were busied with a Whitsun morris-dance .
Never in your life , I think , unless you see canary put me down .
But If thou dost break her virgin knot before All sanctimonious ceremonies may With full and holy rite be ministered , No sweet aspersion shall the heavens let fall To make this contract grow , but barren hate , Sour-eyed disdain , and discord shall bestrew The union of your bed with weeds so loathly That you shall hate it both .

Some wine , ho !
We will be satisfied !
Although I joy in thee , I have no joy of this contract tonight .
You talk !
Thus when I shun Scylla your father , I fall into Charybdis your mother .
But all remember What you have said , and show yourselves true Romans .
Take it thankfully .

A thousand times the worse to want thy light .
Come , my sweet Kate .
Therefore use thy discretion .
And that were enough to hang us all .
I think not so , my lord .
Seek it out .
For any good That I myself have done unto myself ?

Well , my conscience , hanging about the neck of my heart , says very wisely to me , "My honest friend Launcelot , being an honest man's son" , or rather an honest woman's son , for indeed my father did something smack , something grow to .
With what addition ?

You'll win two days upon me .
If not , your pardon and my return shall be the end of my business .
I have heard too much , and your words and performances are no kin together .

Once more , what news ?
Grandam , one night as we did sit at supper , My uncle Rivers talked how I did grow More than my brother : "Ay , " quoth my uncle Gloucester , "Small herbs have grace ; great weeds do grow apace." And since , methinks I would not grow so fast Because sweet flowers are slow and weeds make haste .
These times of woe afford no time to woo .
But for the bloody napkin ?
Tis not to me she speaks .
No slander .
Ay , and for that thou diest .
Away !
All thy tediousness on me , ah ?
You shall play it in a mask , and you may speak as small as you will .

It is my wretched fortune .
I speak but in the figures and comparisons of it .

Boy , this shall not excuse the injuries That thou hast done me .
What further woe conspires against mine age ?
Will you have some more sauce to your leek ?
How is it with her ?
I tell you , 'tis incredible to believe How much she loves me .
Be your tears wet ?
Doth Fortune play the huswife with me now ?
Will you have her ?
Where are they ?
To our house .
My master stays in the street .
Your looks are pale and wild , and do import Some misadventure .
The wood of Birnam .
If they do this , As , if God please , they shall , my ransom then Will soon be levied .
Your reason .

Fly , my lord , fly .
Post to Salisbury .
O this learning , what a thing it is !
Who is that calls so coldly ?

Let that be left Which leaves itself .
God-a-mercy , Grumio !
Ill luck , ill luck ?
Nay , I'll ne'er believe a madman till I see his brains .
To Caesar will I render My legions and my horse .

Go with me , Silvius .
No words .
Oh , thou wilt speak again of banishment .
O dear !
Where is kind Hastings ?
Let me go .
Be attentive .
And for their sake , In your fair minds let this acceptance take .

The moon ?
Vile earth , to earth resign .
Give me your hand , sir .

Will you hear the letter ?
The duke's to blame in this .
There's money for thee .
Thus do all traitors .
Therefore another prologue must tell he is not a lion .
Tell me your counsels .
Go with me to the duchess .
I'll not be strucken , my lord .
Well then , if ever I thank any man , I'll thank you .
Strumpet , I come .
Why let it strike ?
Thou shouldst rather ask if it were possible any villainy should be so rich .
If thou rememberest aught ere thou camest here , How thou camest here thou mayst .
Be simple-answered , for we know the truth .
Again !
No .
Oh , my heart bleeds To think o ' th ' teen that I have turned you to , Which is from my remembrance !
Would you would bear your fortune like a man !
What are you ?
I know not , madam .
But thou wouldst not think how ill all's here about my heart .
Pluck out his eyes .
Have at thee , coward !
Will not the mayor then and his brethren come ?
My lord is often thus And hath been from his youth .
No doubt , no doubt .
Think on Lord Hastings .
I know him to be valiant .
Ay , but their sense is shut .

This fellow doth not stand upon points .
Fie upon "But yet." "But yet" is as a jailer to bring forth Some monstrous malefactor .

Oh , thy vile lady !
Well , go thy way .
I can not drink too much of Brutus ' love .
Speak not against it .
Then lead the way , good father ; and heavens so shine That they may fairly note this act of mine .
Nay , come , let's go together .
I thank you for your company , but , good faith , I had as lief have been myself alone .
By a name I know not how to tell thee who I am .

Not so , not so .
O , serve me well , and teach yourselves that duty !
I myself .
I rather choose To wrong the dead , to wrong myself and you , Than I will wrong such honorable men .
Lorenzo and Salerio , welcome hither , If that the youth of my new interest here Have power to bid you welcome .

Excellent well !
Is that his answer ?
The boy was the very staff of my age , my very prop .

O my dear lord , Nay , do not think I flatter .
He kills her in her own humor .
Will you go with me ?
Do you not know I am a woman ?
I pray you , give me leave .
I think she'll sooner prove a soldier .
O God's lady dear , Are you so hot ?
It was my duty , sir .
What ring gave you my lord ?
Five-and-twenty , sir .
You shall advise me in all for Cleopatra .
How comes that ?
But thine doth fry .
That I'll try .
But be thou armed for some unhappy words .
Well , I conceive .
Put up your sword .
Your Majesty says very true .
My dear Othello !
Farewell , my coz .
What trumpet is that same ?

Methinks I hear Antony call .
We defy augury .
Unarm , Eros .
What a long night is this !
Armed , say you ?
Prison , my lord ?
Can you not stay awhile ?
It is your music , madam , of the house .
As Caesar loved me , I weep for him .
But now , Baptista , to your younger daughter .
Twas a shame no less Than was his loss , to course your flying flags And leave his navy gazing .
We'll have thee to a couch Softer and sweeter than the lustful bed On purpose trimmed up for Semiramis .
But speak you on .
I had rather than forty pound I were at home .
You shall not seal to such a bond for me !
Less in your knowledge and your grace you show not Than our earth's wonder , more than earth divine .

Grumio , my horse .
Marry , that am I and my partner .
Fathers commonly Do get their children .
Very well , my lord .

Is not this Stephano , my drunken butler ?
Why then , good night indeed .
Therefore , since brevity is the soul of wit And tediousness the limbs and outward flourishes , I will be brief : your noble son is mad .

We are very sorry for't .
A plague upon you , murderers , traitors all !
When Roscius was an actor in Rome , The actors are come hither , my lord .

You are i ' the right , sir , 'tis for my mistress .
Let her awhile be secretly kept in And publish it that she is dead indeed .
Prithee , how many boys and wenches must I have ?
Did I deserve no more than a fool's head ?
So help me every spirit sanctified As I have spoken for you all my best And stood within the blank of his displeasure For my free speech .
Pray you come in .
Let us swear That you are worth your breeding , which I doubt not ,
By no means , sir .

Tarry a little .
That is he .
All ?
My wife is coming yonder .
If it please you .
And for Cassio , let me be his undertaker .

Why , how now , Charmian ?
Where are these hearts ?
And I the king shall love thee .
Shall we not , Sir Andrew ?
Abhorred slave , Which any print of goodness wilt not take , Being capable of all ill !
The hour steals on .
Can you tell if Rosalind , the duke's daughter , be banished with her father ?

Why , horns , which such as you are fain to be beholding to your wives for .
Therefore , fair Hermia , question your desires .
Follow me not .

This course I fittest choose , For forty ducats is too much to lose .
I am so .
A match !
In a false quarrel there is no true valor .
Men may sleep , and they may have their throats about them at that time , and some say knives have edges .

If this young gentleman Have done offence , I take the fault on me .
Stephano !
But fare ye well .
What is the matter ?
Sing it .
O , in the battle think on Buckingham , And die in terror of thy guiltiness .
Be trusty , and I'll quit thy pains .

The table's full .
Where wilt thou lead me ?
Your cousin , my lady , takes great exceptions to your ill hours .

Dost thou know me , fellow ?
A poor virgin , sir , an ill-favored thing , sir , but mine own .
Wherefore did they not That hour destroy us ?
Madam , sleeps still .
And if it sort not well , you may conceal her , As best befits her wounded reputation , In some reclusive and religious life , Out of all eyes , tongues , minds , and injuries .
Soft !
While then , God be with you !
Macbeth !
Not a false gallop .
Bring us the letter .
Is it even so ?
And why should Caesar be a tyrant then ?

Tarry , sweet soul , for mine ; then fly abreast , As in this glorious and well-foughten field We kept together in our chivalry." Upon these words I came and cheered him up .
To find out you .

Your mistress bears well .
We judge no less. , Uncle of Exeter , Enlarge the man committed yesterday That railed against our person .
Your constancy Hath left you unattended .
Down with him , thief !
That's strange .
O excellent motion !
This heavy-headed revel east and west Makes us traduced and taxed of other nations .
Bring me just notice of the numbers dead On both our parts .
You kiss by th ' book .
I shall attend you presently at your tent .
And so , my lord , adieu .
I am glad of it .
Speak .
I'll board him presently .

Tomorrow night look that thou lie alone .
Why , you must not speak that yet .

I will on with my speech in your praise and then show you the heart of my message .
If you should die before him , where's her dower ?
Why , 'tis not possible .
There I deny my land service .
He made you for a highway to my bed , But I , a maid , die maiden-widowed .
I humbly thank your ladyship .
Mistress , that you know .
Speak within door .
The madly used Malvolio." Did he write this ?
Take heed , sirrah , the whip .
Tis two or three , my lord , that bring you word Macduff is fled to England .
The messengers from our sister and the king .
By this sword , I will .
Nay , I bear it on my shoulders as a beggar wont her brat , and I think when he hath lamed me , I shall beg with it from door to door .
When they are gone , then must I count my gains .
If they suffer our departure , death's the word .
Fly , masters !
Tis fit we understand them .
Be not ta'en tardy by unwise delay .
Come , come , let us thither .
Full many a lady I have eyed with best regard and many a time
O me , my heart , my rising heart !
Here's another More potent than the first .
What , are you mad ?
You advise me well .
What , my good lord ?
Come , let's away to prison .
A quarrel , but nothing wherefore .
An there be any matter of weight chances , call up me .
