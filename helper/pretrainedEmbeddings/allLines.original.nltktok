How chance the roses there do fade so fast ?
I ' th ' mire .
O , for my beads !
A proper saying !

I say , O Caesar , Antony is dead .
Caesar is sad , and Lepidus , Since Pompey's feast , as Menas says , is troubled With the greensickness .
Not this , but troubles of the marriage bed .
What is thy soul of adoration ?
How now ?
Though all the world could see , None could be so abused in sight as he .
Hast thou no care of me ?
Shall we their fond pageant see ?
Farewell both .
Now , my co-mates and brothers in exile , Hath not old custom made this life more sweet Than that of painted pomp ?

I am glad to see you .
The son is fled .
Thus we may see , " quoth he , "how the world wags .
Give me leave. , I am a gentleman of Verona , sir , That hearing of her beauty and her wit , Her affability and bashful modesty , Her wondrous qualities and mild behavior , Am bold to show myself a forward guest Within your house , to make mine eye the witness Of that report which I so oft have heard .
Such news , my lord , as grieves me to report .
He is or ta'en or slain .
Stand fast , Titinius .

What did you mean by that same handkerchief you gave me even now ?
I am sorry that your leisure serves you not. , Antonio , gratify this gentleman , For in my mind you are much bound to him .
Let them come in .
Drown thyself ?
This moral ties me over to time and a hot summer .
No , cousin , I'll to Fife .
If haply you my father do suspect An instrument of this your calling back , Lay not your blame on me .
I must away this night toward Padua , And it is meet I presently set forth .
It is more worthy to leap in ourselves Than tarry till they push us .
How now , brother Edmund ?
But she , your subject , loathes such sovereignty .
Impatient of my absence , And grief that young Octavius with Mark Antony Have made themselves so strong , for with her death That tidings came , with this she fell distract And , her attendants absent , swallowed fire .
Alas , thou hast misconstrued everything !
So please you , What says the fellow there ?
Your voice shall be as strong as any man's In the disposing of new dignities .
Sconce" call you it ?
Brother Anthony ,
That courtesy would be uncleanly if courtiers were shepherds .
Be of good cheer .

What , my old worshipful old master ?
I'll tell thee how Beatrice praised thy wit he other day .
You hear how he importunes me .
There is no power in Venice Can alter a decree established .
Meseemeth good that with some little train Forthwith from Ludlow the young prince be fet Hither to London , to be crowned our king .
There's other business for thee .
I conjure thee by all the saints in heaven .
No , by no means .
But if these , As I am sure they do , bear fire enough To kindle cowards and to steel with valor The melting spirits of women , then , countrymen , What need we any spur but our own cause To prick us to redress ?
And when that time comes , Afflict me with thy mocks , pity me not , As till that time I shall not pity thee .
I do not think there is any such woman .

Tell him we could have rebuked him at Harfleur , but that we thought not good to bruise an injury till it were full ripe .
Come your ways .
The Lord Grandpre .

Now would I give a thousand furlongs of sea for an acre of barren ground : long heath , brown furze , anything .
Who wrongs him ?
Caesar did write for him to come to Rome .
She ate no meat today , nor none shall eat .
I mean , the Lord Protector .
What , with the case of eyes ?
Myself ?
Who shall begin ?
Come , Vaughan .
No , some of it is for my child's father .
If you do not , if I be left alone , Now , by mine honor , which is yet mine own , I'll have that doctor for my bedfellow .
I will not leave him now till Cassio Be called to him. , How is 't with you , my lord ?
Soldier , you must come to the king .
Tis passing good .
Each heart in Rome does love and pity you .
A hundred then .
Worthy Macbeth , we stay upon your leisure .
As the ox hath his bow , sir , the horse his curb , and the falcon her bells , so man hath his desires ; and as pigeons bill , so wedlock would be nibbling .
Hear me , recreant !
Let us swear That you are worth your breeding , which I doubt not ,
Twas I , but 'tis not I. I do not shame To tell you what I was , since my conversion So sweetly tastes , being the thing I am .
Ay , or any show that you will show him .
Hence his ambition growing , Dost thou hear ?
Marry , thou dost wrong me , thou dissembler , thou .
And thane of Cawdor too : went it not so ?
What a sigh is there !
Fortune now To my heart's hope !
There's not a piece of feather in our host , Good argument , I hope , we will not fly , And time hath worn us into slovenry .
The prince my brother hath outgrown me far .
Is 't come to this ?
So , adieu .
Myself and what is mine to you and yours Is now converted .
We came crying hither .
His roguish madness Allows itself to any thing .
See , your wife's with him .
The man is notwithstanding sufficient .
Let's all sink wi ' th ' king .
Here is the cap your Worship did bespeak .
Here comes the noble Antony .
Even here Do we shake hands .
And so they parted .
Trebonius knows his time .
It shall be called "Bottom's Dream" because it hath no bottom .
My lord , I have remembrances of yours That I have longed long to redeliver .
Follow that lord , and look you mock him not .
Those uncles which you want were dangerous .
Sweet now , silence .
I will fall prostrate at his feet And never rise until my tears and prayers Have won his grace to come in person hither And take perforce my husband from the Abbess .
Ah , my poor princes !
Therefore the moon , the governess of floods , Pale in her anger , washes all the air , That rheumatic diseases do abound .
Sure , these are but imaginary wiles , And lapland sorcerers inhabit here .
Spoke like a tall man that respects thy reputation .
Wilt thou show the whole wealth of thy wit in an instant ?
Here come the lovers , full of joy and mirth. , Joy , gentle friends !
Her only fault , and that is faults enough , Is that she is intolerable curst , And shrewd and froward , so beyond all measure That , were my state far worser than it is , I would not wed her for a mine of gold .
Prithee , how many boys and wenches must I have ?
Why , 'tis a cockle or a walnut shell , A knack , a toy , a trick , a baby's cap .
You mar our labor .
Out of my sight !
This guest of summer , The temple-haunting martlet , does approve , By his loved mansionry , that the heaven's breath Smells wooingly here .
Madam , not now .
Thou art a soul in bliss , but I am bound Upon a wheel of fire , that mine own tears Do scald like molten lead .
I mean , my head upon your lap ?
Were they not forced with those that should be ours , We might have met them dareful , beard to beard , And beat them backward home .
peace , this piece of toasted cheese will do 't .
There thou mayst brain him , Having first seized his books ; or with a log Batter his skull ; or paunch him with a stake ; Or cut his weasand with thy knife .
I , by attorney , bless thee from thy mother , Who prays continually for Richmond's good .
Come , there is sauce for it .
Forbear , and eat no more .
Come , come !
My husband ?
I dare abide no longer .
I'll send my prayers with him .
My house was at the Phoenix ?
Those that with haste will make a mighty fire Begin it with weak straws .
Good faith , a little one , not past a pint , As I am a soldier .
No , you shall pardon me .
Do it carefully. , And the noble and true-hearted Kent banished , his offense honesty !
You think I'll weep ?
What , art mad ?
Thou liest .
Oh , temperance , lady !
Had I great Juno's power , The strong-winged Mercury should fetch thee up And set thee by Jove's side .
Security gives way to conspiracy .
Look you , if you take the matter otherwise than is meant , Captain Macmorris , peradventure I shall think you do not use me with that affability as , in discretion , you ought to use me , look you , being as good a man as yourself , both in the disciplines of war and in the derivation of my birth and in other particularities .

Affection is not rated from the heart .
Sit then and talk with her .
Why , thou sayst well .
Oh , heavy ignorance !
She can not endure to hear tell of a husband .
I am th ' unhappy subject of these quarrels .
Go you with me , uncle of Exeter .
O , full of danger is the duke of Gloucester , And the queen's sons and brothers haught and proud , And were they to be ruled , and not to rule , This sickly land might solace as before .
I'll plague him .
Not th' imperious show Of the full-fortuned Caesar ever shall Be brooched with me .
Receive what cheer you may .
Sir , I say to you it is thought you are false knaves .
Nor I , my lord .
What is it she does now ?
Sir , Octavius is already come to Rome .
Sweet Beatrice , wouldst thou come when I called thee ?
Unfold it .
He would not have spoke such a word .
Go to my chamber , put on clothes of mine .
We are haunted .
O noble lord , bethink thee of thy birth , Call home thy ancient thoughts from banishment , And banish hence these abject lowly dreams .
No shame but mine .
The Queen Of audience nor desire shall fail , so she From Egypt drive her all-disgraced friend Or take his life there .
Fulvia ?
What's the matter here ?
Now Edmund , where's the villain ?
If it be not for some purpose of import , Give 't me again .
Go you and tell her of it .
Oh , no , good Kate .
Sit .
The patch is kind enough , but a huge feeder , Snail-slow in profit , and he sleeps by day More than the wildcat .
Think you my uncle did dissemble , grandam ?
Shall I lay perjury upon my soul ?
No , my good lord .
The earth hath bubbles , as the water has , And these are of them .
Since the youth will not be entreated , his own peril on his forwardness .
Nothing , but this is so .
Cried he ?
And you must cut this flesh from off his breast .
This in the public eye ?
Goodman Verges , sir , speaks a little off the matter .
I am thy father's spirit , Doomed for a certain term to walk the night And for the day confined to fast in fires , Till the foul crimes done in my days of nature Are burnt and purged away .
Be not ta'en tardy by unwise delay .
What tributaries follow him to Rome To grace in captive bonds his chariot wheels ?
But in respect of that , I would fain think it were not .
O , let me make the period to my curse !
But leave it all to God .
Time hath not yet so dried this blood of mine Nor age so eat up my invention Nor fortune made such havoc of my means Nor my bad life reft me so much of friends But they shall find , awaked in such a kind , Both strength of limb and policy of mind , Ability in means and choice of friends , To quit me of them throughly .
Let every soldier hew him down a bough And bear 't before him .
What , jealous Oberon ? , Fairies , skip hence .
Fool , do not flatter .
Before you can say "Come" and "Go , " And breathe twice and cry "So , so ! " Each one , tripping on his toe ,
Stay , stand apart .
Can anything be made of this ?
How now , Tubal ?
What proof shall I make of that ?
Two or three groan .
Come , come , we know your meaning , brother Gloucester .
Of what kind should this cock come of ?
Take up the bodies .
Know'st thou his mind ?
Why , so .
Then , tell me , Who's the next heir of Naples ?
Let's do so .
Monster , I do smell all horse piss , at which my nose is in great indignation .
Ne'er a fantastical knave of them all shall flout me out of my calling .
My villainy ?
Why the wrong is but a wrong i ' th ' world , and having the world for your labor , 'tis a wrong in your own world , and you might quickly make it right .
Fare you well , sir .
Big Mars seems bankrupt in their beggared host And faintly through a rusty beaver peeps .
Then stand with us .
What wilt thou do for her ?
And if on earth he do not merit it , In reason he should never come to heaven .
Master , mean you so ?
Let us go in , And charge us there upon interr'gatories , And we will answer all things faithfully .
When we our betters see bearing our woes , We scarcely think our miseries our foes .
Come on , then .
Nay , yet there's more in this .
That hath made him mad .
Shylock , albeit I neither lend nor borrow By taking nor by giving of excess , Yet to supply the ripe wants of my friend , I'll break a custom .
Take thy face hence .
Proculeius , What thou hast done thy master Caesar knows , And he hath sent for thee .
Farewell .
Though the nature of our quarrel yet never brooked parle , know now upon advice , it toucheth us both , that we may yet again have access to our fair mistress and be happy rivals in Bianca's love , to labor and effect one thing specially .
We talk with goblins , owls , and sprites : If we obey them not , this will ensue : They'll suck our breath , or pinch us black and blue .
Such and so finely bolted didst thou seem .
What , is Antonio here ?
The wall , methinks , being sensible , should curse again .
Right well , dear madam .
Thou art thy father's daughter .
My present business calls me from you now .
Tis not the first time you were overshot .
And look to have it yielded with all kindness .
For this relief much thanks .
But Macbeth is .
Kings it makes gods , and meaner creatures kings .
Nay , lay thee down and roar , For thou hast killed the sweetest innocent That e'er did lift up eye .
Is it your own inclining ?
I fear your disposition .
A very mean meaning .
I know the man .
Calphurnia !
Prithee , friend , Pour out the pack of matter to mine ear , The good and bad together .
So , again , good night .
Speak to him .
But is this law ?
Had I been any god of power , I would Have sunk the sea within the earth or ere It should the good ship so have swallowed and The fraughting souls within her .
Set your countenance , sir .
We can not fight for love as men may do .
O momentary grace of mortal men , Which we more hunt for than the grace of God !
Content you , gentlemen .
Through the house give glimmering light , By the dead and drowsy fire .
So shines a good deed in a naughty world .
Oh , the good gods !
Nay , very pale .
Their villainy goes against my weak stomach , and therefore I must cast it up .
My lord , we were sent for .
Let me work .
This jack of Caesar's shall Bear us an errand to him .
Shall I strike now ?
Who's there ?
A mighty man of Pisa .
It doth appear you are a worthy judge .
And fair she is , if that mine eyes be true .
To leave his wife , to leave his babes , His mansion and his titles in a place From whence himself does fly ?
That he hath not .
Tis here .
I'll do 't .
I did not think he had been acquainted with her .
O my son , what theme ?
Within a month , Ere yet the salt of most unrighteous tears Had left the flushing in her galled eyes , She married .
Then meet me forthwith at the notary's .
Alas , poor rogue , I think indeed she loves me .
Know you any , Hero ?
You all did see that on the Lupercal I thrice presented him a kingly crown , Which he did thrice refuse .
Die for adultery ?
Only he hath not yet subscribed this : Where your Majesty demands that the king of France , having any occasion to write for matter of grant , shall name your Highness in this form and with this addition , in French : Nor this I have not , brother , so denied But your request shall make me let it pass .
Show me the place .
I have a daughter .
I confess the cape .
Calphurnia here , my wife , stays me at home .
Therefore , my sweet Rose , my dear Rose , be merry .
To go out of my dialect , which you discommend so much .
The town will rise .
Till then , lead thou first .
Take some remembrance of us as a tribute , Not as a fee .
Tie up the libertine in a field of feasts , Keep his brain fuming .
I would entreat you rather to put on Your boldest suit of mirth , for we have friends That purpose merriment .
Fly further off , my lord , fly further off .
My lord ?
Let's carve him as a dish fit for the gods , Not hew him as a carcass fit for hounds .
What is your will that I shall do with this ?
Consider how it stands upon my credit .
Sweet men , come to him .
Ready .
I was of late as petty to his ends As is the morn-dew on the myrtle leaf To his grand sea .
Tis time to look about .
Do that good mischief which may make this island Thine own for ever , and I , thy Caliban , For aye thy foot-licker .
Our arms in strength of malice and our hearts Of brothers ' temper do receive you in With all kind love , good thoughts , and reverence .
I took no more pains for those thanks than you took pains to thank me." That's as much as to say , "Any pains that I take for you is as easy as thanks." If I do not take pity of her , I am a villain .
Thou bleed'st apace .
You use this dalliance to excuse Your breach of promise to the Porpentine .
I will deny thee nothing !
Away , I do beseech you , both away .
If he do bleed , I'll gild the faces of the grooms withal , For it must seem their guilt .
I am not mad .
Their great guilt , Like poison given to work a great time after , Now 'gins to bite the spirits .
Then yield thee , coward , And live to be the show and gaze o ' th ' time .
Rarely , rarely .
Happy is Hermia , wheresoe'er she lies , For she hath blessed and attractive eyes .
I will do any thing , Nerissa , ere I'll be married to a sponge .
The general and his wife are talking of it , And she speaks for you stoutly .
He has killed me , mother .
For England his approaches makes as fierce As waters to the sucking of a gulf .

But if the cause be not good , the king himself hath a heavy reckoning to make , when all those legs and arms and heads , chopped off in a battle , shall join together at the latter day , and cry all , "We died at such a place , " some swearing , some crying for a surgeon , some upon their wives left poor behind them , some upon the debts they owe , some upon their children rawly left .
I can not go no further .
Pompey is strong at sea , And it appears he is beloved of those That only have feared Caesar .

So smooth he daubed his vice with show of virtue That , his apparent open guilt omitted , I mean his conversation with Shore's wife , He lived from all attainder of suspects .
Not here in presence .
What do you mean ?
Some o' their plants are ill-rooted already .

Think , my lord ?
Can I bear that with patience , And not my husband's secrets ?
Oh , let us yet be merciful .
Not in my husband's nose .
You are now within a foot Of th ' extreme verge .
No further , sir .
This casket threatens .
I shall take it , sir .
You must bear with me .
Your answer , sir , is enigmatical .
Why call you me "love" ?
The shame itself doth speak For instant remedy .
Madam , he's well .
What wouldst thou , fellow ?
Carry him gently to my fairest chamber And hang it round with all my wanton pictures .
I will o'ertake thee , Cleopatra , and Weep for my pardon .
Thus answer I in the name of Benedick , But hear these ill news with the ears of Claudio .
Foul deeds will rise , Though all the earth o'erwhelm them , to men's eyes .
Maybe the letter moved him , For , as I think , they do command him home , Deputing Cassio in his government .
Is he not honest ?
It is too true an evil .
So that , as clear as is the summer's sun , King Pepin's title and Hugh Capet's claim , King Lewis his satisfaction , all appear To hold in right and title of the female .
If you shall cleave to my consent , when 'tis , It shall make honor for you .
I have perceived a most faint neglect of late , which I have rather blamed as mine own jealous curiosity than as a very pretense and purpose of unkindness .
He that has a house to put 's head in has a good headpiece .
Why doth the Jew pause ?
Enough .
Was ever match clapped up so suddenly ?
Nor must not then be yielded to in this .
As a friend .
Now , then , we'll use His countenance for the battle , which being done , Let her who would be rid of him devise His speedy taking off .
But , for your conscience ?
The sky doth frown and lour upon our army .
Thy lands and all things that thou dost call thine Worth seizure , do we seize into our hands Till thou canst quit thee by thy brother's mouth Of what we think against thee .
Yes .
Fare you well .
His speech was like a tangled chain .
I am not guilty of Lysander's blood .

Tie up my love's tongue .
And are not you my husband ?
By my knavery ( if I had it ) , then I were .
O , my old master. , Who hath bound him here ?
Fear not my government .
I will make myself known to Desdemona .
He , that Caliban Whom now I keep in service .
Why , what an ass am I !
What , are we cuckolds ere we have deserved it ?
Here comes the lady .
In which array , brave soldier , doth he lie , Larding the plain , and by his bloody side , Yoke-fellow to his honor-owing wounds , The noble earl of Suffolk also lies .
Fly , fly , my lord .
Thou know'st 'tis common .
How now , Grumio ?
Shylock is my name .
Cold , cold , my girl , Even like thy chastity .
I can not speak enough of this content .
World , world , O world !
Tremblingly she stood And on the sudden dropped .
You know tomorrow is the wedding day .
Not sad , my lord .
Here , here !
Is it not hard , Nerissa , that I can not choose one nor refuse none ?
Dear my lord , Be not familiar with her .
Saw you no more ?
My gracious sovereign .
Like one of two contending in a prize That thinks he hath done well in people's eyes , Hearing applause and universal shout , Giddy in spirit , still gazing in a doubt Whether these pearls of praise be his or no , So , thrice fair lady , stand I even so , As doubtful whether what I see be true Until confirmed , signed , ratified by you .
Would the night were come !
Vouchsafe to those that have not read the story That I may prompt them ; and of such as have , I humbly pray them to admit th ' excuse Of time , of numbers , and due course of things , Which can not in their huge and proper life Be here presented .
Pluck up , my heart , and be sad .
He would have deserved it .
Unknit that threat'ning unkind brow And dart not scornful glances from those eyes To wound thy lord , thy king , thy governor .
We'll away tonight , And be a day before our husbands home .
We are friends .
What is 't you do ?
Go you , call hither my fool .
Are you there , wife ?
Why then I think Cassio's an honest man .
Who alone suffers , suffers most i ' th ' mind , Leaving free things and happy shows behind .
Well , go to .
Music , hark .
I'll have no halves .
Madam , madam , Antonio's dead !
It must be thought on .
Nay , but , Ophelia , Pray you , mark .
Very ill , too .

Sir , you and I must part , but that's not it .
I will be hanged else !

He attendeth here hard by To know your answer whether you'll admit him .
Is he pursued ?
What masque , what music ?
I do attend here on the general And think it no addition , nor my wish , To have him see me womaned .
Thou art a fellow of a good respect .
Didst thou behold Octavia ?
There's strange news come , sir .
But that still use of grief makes wild grief tame , My tongue should to thy ears not name my boys Till that my nails were anchored in thine eyes , And I , in such a desp'rate bay of death , Like a poor bark of sails and tackling reft , Rush all to pieces on thy rocky bosom .
Soldier , thou art ; but his whole action grows Not in the power on 't .
Oh , the heavens !

This not to do , So grace and mercy at your most need help you , Swear .
Come , march to wakes and fairs and market towns .
I leave him to your gracious acceptance , whose trial shall better publish his commendation." You hear the learned Bellario , what he writes .
First , there is the Neapolitan prince .
Was 't not the way ?
He is already named and gone to Scone To be invested .
Fear it , my dear sister , And keep you in the rear of your affection , Out of the shot and danger of desire .
A man that had a wife with such a wit , he might say "Wit , whither wilt ? " Nay , you might keep that check for it , till you met your wife's wit going to your neighbor's bed .
In the same figure like the king that's dead .
You say not right , old man .
Your dinner , and the generous islanders By you invited , do attend your presence .
Well , I conceive .
I hope my noble lord esteems me honest .
Is this certain ?
Welcome .
Would he deny his letter , said he ?
So good night unto you all .
Till then , my noble friend , chew upon this : Brutus had rather be a villager Than to repute himself a son of Rome Under these hard conditions as this time Is like to lay upon us .
We are no tyrant , but a Christian king , Unto whose grace our passion is as subject As is our wretches fettered in our prisons .
This is the brief of money , plate , and jewels I am possessed of .
These injuries the king now bears will be revenged home .
What had he done to you ?
Notwithstanding , use your pleasure .
But did you ever tell him she was false ?
I will see them .
But I am constant as the northern star , Of whose true-fixed and resting quality There is no fellow in the firmament .
On , on , on , on , on !
No .
I dare not , dear , Dear my lord , pardon , I dare not , Lest I be taken .
Your charm so strongly works 'em That if you now beheld them , your affections Would become tender .
Amen , if you love her , for the lady is very well worthy .
For Lord Hamlet , Believe so much in him that he is young , And with a larger tether may he walk Than may be given you .
What manner o' thing is your crocodile ?
Then shall the sighs of Octavia blow the fire up in Caesar , and , as I said before , that which is the strength of their amity shall prove the immediate author of their variance .
He hath every month a new sworn brother .
Call her forth , brother .
Excellent well !
Those of his chamber , as it seemed , had done 't .
Let's make us med'cines of our great revenge , To cure this deadly grief .
We'll along ourselves , and meet them at Philippi .
Would 't had been done !

Stanley , he is your wife's son .

There's my hand .

In faith , he's penitent , And yet his trespass , in our common reason ( Save that , they say , the wars must make example Out of her best ) is not , almost , a fault T ' incur a private check .

Let it alone , thou fool .
Yon ribaudred nag of Egypt , Whom leprosy o'ertake ! , i' th' midst o' th' fight , When vantage like a pair of twins appeared Both as the same , or rather ours the elder , The breeze upon her , like a cow in June , Hoists sails and flies .
What's he ?
But fathers that bear bags Shall see their children kind .
Adieu , good Monsieur Melancholy .
Then pardon him , sweet father , for my sake .
My husband lost his life to get the crown , And often up and down my sons were tossed For me to joy , and weep , their gain and loss .
Within our files there are , Of those that served Mark Antony but late , Enough to fetch him in .
I have a thing for you .
Take the hint Which my despair proclaims .
I think we are too bold upon your rest .
That is the very defect of the matter , sir .
Tis figured in my tongue .
Is the chair empty ?
Tis death for anyone in Mantua To come to Padua .
Sweet Prince , you learn me noble thankfulness. , There , Leonato , take her back again .
We'll visit Caliban , my slave who never Yields us kind answer .
There , My music playing far off , I will betray Tawny-finned fishes .
Tigers , not daughters , what have you performed ?
I doubt not of your wisdom .
Vanish , or I shall give thee thy deserving , And blemish Caesar's triumph .
But on thy side I may not be too forward , Lest , being seen , thy brother , tender George , Be executed in his father's sight .
A friend .
Go back again , thou slave , and fetch him home .
Come , come , you're drunk .
I shall obey you .
Bring thou the master to the citadel .
The king and queen and all are coming down .
I would not kill thy unprepared spirit .
Who's here ?
It is Captain Macmorris , is it not ?
That from your first of difference and decay Have followed your sad steps .
O noble sir !
Oh , the cry did knock Against my very heart !
I'll fume with them ! " And with that word she struck me on the head , And through the instrument my pate made way ,
Why should that name be sounded more than yours ?
This deed of thine is no more worthy heaven Than thou wast worthy her .
You'll ask me why I rather choose to have A weight of carrion flesh than to receive Three thousand ducats .
I .
Seem they religious ?
These ducats pawn I for my father here .
Why then , your uncle and the Prince and Claudio Have been deceived .
I have no great devotion to the deed And yet he hath given me satisfying reasons .
how , I pray ?
Come hither , you rogue !
Tell me where it is .
They told me I was everything .
I do not , sir .
But wherefore could not I pronounce "Amen" ?
For several virtues Have I liked several women .
O Antony !
I shall miss thee , But yet thou shalt have freedom. , So , so , so. , To the king's ship , invisible as thou art .
For we will fetters put upon this fear , Which now goes too free-footed .
Sola !
I assure you , Carthage .
Reputation , reputation , reputation !
Bear it coldly but till midnight and let the issue show itself .
I am none of these , my lord .
Prithee , see there !
I will here shroud till the dregs of the storm be past .
Hard , hard. , O filthy traitor !
You need not tell us what Lord Hamlet said .
One .
This murderous shaft that's shot Hath not yet lighted , and our safest way Is to avoid the aim .
In my school days , when I had lost one shaft , I shot his fellow of the selfsame flight The selfsame way with more advised watch To find the other forth , and by adventuring both , I oft found both .
Heaven and thy thoughts are witness that thou art .
Know , my long lord , The marquess Dorset , as I hear , is fled To Richmond , in the parts where he abides .
How now , you secret , black , and midnight hags ?
We will speak further .
I would know that .
It is very true .
Or docks , or mallows .
Not yet quite dead ?
I would have thought her spirit had been invincible against all assaults of affection .
Perforce I must confess I thought you lord of more true gentleness .
Trust me , I take him for the better dog .
What mean your graces ?
Madam , bethink you , like a careful mother , Of the young prince your son .
One side will mock another , th ' other too .
They stand and would have parley .
See how they kiss and court !
Why , there was a crown offered him ; and , being offered him , he put it by with the back of his hand , thus ; and then the people fell a-shouting .
Speed him hence .
Well , well .
Your wife Octavia , with her modest eyes And still conclusion , shall acquire no honor Demuring upon me .
Tell me thine first .
Where's my son Edmund ?
And so , without more circumstance at all , I hold it fit that we shake hands and part .
One word more Shall make me chide thee , if not hate thee .
Thou canst not fear us , Pompey , with thy sails .
On the sixth hour , at which time , my lord , You said our work should cease .
A most miraculous work in this good king , Which often since my here-remain in England I have seen him do .
Marcus Luccicos , is not he in town ?
But have I not cause to weep ?
O excellent young man !
I know not at whose suit he is arrested well , But he's in a suit of buff which 'rested him ; that can I tell .
The rest will comfort , for thy counsel's sound .
Follow me .
Thou call'st on him that hates thee .
What think'st thou ?
I will not fail you .
If they speak but truth of her , These hands shall tear her ; if they wrong her honor , The proudest of them shall well hear of it .
Now sits the wind fair , and we will aboard .
The worm that's fled Hath nature that in time will venom breed ; No teeth for th ' present .
But adieu .
Come , Dolabella , see High order in this great solemnity .
The duke of Exeter doth love thee well .
Look to 't .
Tomorrow , as he purposes .
Here thought they to have done Some wanton charm upon this man and maid , Whose vows are that no bed-right shall be paid Till Hymen's torch be lighted , but in vain .
Doth his Majesty Incline to it or no ?
Brief , I recovered him , bound up his wound , And after some small space , being strong at heart ,
Thou troublest me ; I am not in the vein .
All's cheerless , dark , and deadly .
Nay , if they lead to any ill , I will leave them at the next turning .
I should know that voice .
But either it was different in blood ,
There will we dine .
I thank his Grace .
O , cleave , my sides !
Come , down into the boat .
O , good sir , I do .
Moved , " in good time .
Come , lords , will you go To comfort Edward with our company ?
I have done my duty .
Foul shame upon you , you have all moved mine .
Listen but speak not to 't .
All hail , great master !
Fortune , that arrant whore , Ne'er turns the key to th ' poor .
To the seaside straightway !
Peace , sirrah !
His knights grow riotous , and himself upbraids us On every trifle .
He is called Aunchient Pistol .
Oh , treble woe Fall ten times treble on that cursed head , Whose wicked deed thy most ingenious sense Deprived thee of !
Death is the fairest cover for her shame That may be wished for .
Madam , good hope .
Cancel his bond of life , dear God I pray , That I may live to say , "The dog is dead."
By the eighth hour .
I was , but I do find more pain in banishment Than death can yield me here by my abode .
If he come tomorrow , I'll give him his payment .
He therefore sends you , meeter for your spirit , This tun of treasure , and , in lieu of this , Desires you let the dukedoms that you claim Hear no more of you .
More company !
O , if thou be'st the same Egeon , speak , And speak unto the same Emilia .
More of this hereafter .
For two , and sound ones too .
By the apostle Paul , shadows tonight Have struck more terror to the soul of Richard Than can the substance of ten thousand soldiers Armed in proof and led by shallow Richmond .
There's warrant in that theft Which steals itself when there's no mercy left .
I'll make you amends next , to give you nothing for something .
Thou art a traitor , Off with his head .
Tis well , sir , that you hunted for yourself .
Hold , ho !
What say you to a piece of beef and mustard ?
Gilded tombs do worms enfold .
The most infectious pestilence upon thee !
Give me some wine and let me speak a little .
He shall have nothing but the penalty .
Thou makest me merry .
When spake I such a word ?
Now my charms are all o'erthrown , And what strength I have's mine own , Which is most faint .
Demetrius , I will keep my word with thee .
Yet once again proclaim it publicly , If any friend will pay the sum for him , He shall not die ; so much we tender him .
If you swear , my lord , you shall not be forsworn .
Pay him six thousand and deface the bond !
Sinful Macduff , They were all struck for thee !
Were the world mine , Demetrius being bated , The rest I'd give to be to you translated .
Save you , worthy general !
Dear sir , forbear !
Tis in my memory locked , And you yourself shall keep the key of it .
Knock , knock , knock !
Call it my fear That keeps you in the house , and not your own .
Let me entreat you .
Naked in bed , Iago , and not mean harm !
If thou dost I shall never love thee after .
Is Brutus sick ?
Turning th ' accomplishment of many years Into an hour-glass ; for the which supply , Admit me chorus to this history ; Who , prologue-like , your humble patience pray Gently to hear , kindly to judge our play .
If I gave them all my living , I'd keep my coxcombs myself .
No , fair princess .
Dear Duff , I prithee , contradict thyself , And say it is not so .
Draw the curtains , so , so , so .
What means your lordship ?
I dare assure you , sir , 'tis almost two , And 'twill be supper time ere you come there .
Good Volumnius , Thou know'st that we two went to school together .
Vouchsafe , divine perfection of a woman , Of these supposed crimes to give me leave By circumstance but to acquit myself .
Learn it , learn it , marquess .
But here my father comes .
Which of you two did dine with me today ?
Ha , ha , ha !
What raiment will your Honor wear today ?
Upon the right hand I .
Farewell , kind lord .
Ay , my lord .
Iago , who began 't ?
This will put them out of fear .
We'll burn his body in the holy place , And with the brands fire the traitors ' houses .
What is 't o'clock ?
Your way is shorter .
If I do find him fit , I'll move your suit And seek to effect it to my uttermost .
The last was I that felt thy tyranny .
I am not sick if Brutus have in hand Any exploit worthy the name of honor .
Do I entice you ?
Whip me such honest knaves .
This deed will be well welcome to Lorenzo .
It is the lady that Pyramus must love .
How came you , Cassio , by that handkerchief That was my wife's ?
Canst thou blame him ?
In time we hate that which we often fear .
Oh , falsely , falsely murdered !
Will you walk , sir ? , O Desdemona , My lord ?
And this report Hath so exasperated the king that he Prepares for some attempt of war .
So may it be indeed .
Now I see , I see , In Fulvia's death how mine received shall be .
I would they were , that I might die at once , For now they kill me with a living death .
Oh , who hath done this deed ?
Hail , gentle sir .
Thou changed and self-covered thing , for shame !
Thou sing'st sweet music .
My lord of Burgundy .
Give me the letter , sir .
Yes , as sparrows eagles , or the hare the lion .
Sweet marjoram .
He died As one that had been studied in his death To throw away the dearest thing he owed As 'twere a careless trifle .
There's not a man I meet but doth salute me As if I were their well-acquainted friend , And every one doth call me by my name .
No more but e'en a woman , and commanded By such poor passion as the maid that milks And does the meanest chares .
You amaze me .
Ho , ho , ho !
Is all our company here ?
Most happy !
The noble Brutus is ascended .
Blessed pudding !
Mechanic slaves With greasy aprons , rules , and hammers shall Uplift us to the view .
Then must I think you would not have it so .
Bless us !
Nay , blush not , Cleopatra .
What , is the man lunatic ?
And another storm brewing , I hear it sing i ' th ' wind .
For Pyramus is a sweet-faced man , a proper man as one shall see in a summer's day , a most lovely , gentlemanlike man .
Trust me , I fear it has .
Now , by the world , it is a lusty wench .
Give him direction for this merry bond , And I will go and purse the ducats straight , See to my house left in the fearful guard Of an unthrifty knave , and presently I will be with you .
What is it that you would impart to me ?
Oh , my daughter !
Stop it , Marcellus .
I will have my bond .
Thus doth he force the swords of wicked men To turn their own points in their masters ' bosoms .
He is drunk now .
Come now , keep thine oath .
Sister , welcome .
It goes not forward .
I charge thee , speak !
Shall I attend your Grace ?
I warrant you , sir , The white cold virgin snow upon my heart Abates the ardor of my liver .
And let his knights have colder looks among you .
For whose sake did I that ill deed ?
Show me briefly how .
For my part , I am sorry it is turned to a drinking .
Thine eyes , sweet lady , have infected mine .
And therefore is winged Cupid painted blind .
Go bear it to the Centaur , where we host , And stay there , Dromio , till I come to thee .
Hush , Thou think'st there is no more such shapes as he , Having seen but him and Caliban .
Witless else her son .
Come , sir , to dinner. , Dromio , keep the gate .
If you would know your wronger , look on me .
What , shall I be appointed hours as though , belike , I knew not what to take and what to leave , ha ?
I say it is the moon that shines so bright .
Our good old friend , Lay comforts to your bosom , and bestow Your needful counsel to our business , Which craves the instant use .
My fool usurps my body .
Why , she defies me Like Turk to Christian .
What cheer ?
For mine own part , I shall be glad to learn of noble men .
Do you believe his "tenders , " as you call them ?
The funeral baked meats Did coldly furnish forth the marriage tables .
You can not better be employed , Bassanio , Than to live still and write mine epitaph .
Him and his worth and our great need of him You have right well conceited .
Perform 't , or else we damn thee." How , my love ?
You'll bear me a bang for that , I fear .
Well , we'll see 't .
What's thy passion ?
Good my lord , enter here .
God help the noble Claudio !
A strange fish !
Who would fardels bear , To grunt and sweat under a weary life , But that the dread of something after death , The undiscovered country from whose bourn No traveler returns , puzzles the will And makes us rather bear those ills we have Than fly to others that we know not of ?
Portia , art thou gone ?
If I quench thee , thou flaming minister , I can again thy former light restore Should I repent me .
Cleopatra , Not what you have reserved nor what acknowledged Put we i' th' roll of conquest .
The same indeed , a very valiant fellow .
Let music sound while he doth make his choice .
How may that be ?
We'll speak with thee at sea .
What say'st thou , my fair flower de luce ?
I pray thee , let us go and find him out And quicken his embraced heaviness With some delight or other .
Pray you , let Cassio be received again .
This is a fellow of the selfsame color Our sister speaks of. , Come , bring away the stocks !
Is not this Stephano , my drunken butler ?
Help , ho , help !
Ay me , most wretched , That have my heart parted betwixt two friends That does afflict each other !
Ay .
Then she bears some breadth ?
This is all .
I pray you , turn the key and keep our counsel .
What news with you , sir ?
Here's a good world the while .
Committed ?
Who does he accuse ?
O gull !
But give me your hand , Menas .
Where left we last ?
What's the matter , think you ?
Treason !
But do you hear , sir , have you married my daughter without asking my goodwill ?
Pour on , I will endure .
And time is at his period .
All's well , sweeting , Come away to bed. , Myself will be your surgeon .
No , sir .
How idly do they talk !
Good troth , you do me wrong , good sooth , you do , In such disdainful manner me to woo .
But did you not request to have it cut ?
Where art thou , keeper ?
What says your Highness to my just request ?
By heaven , I will acquaint his majesty With those gross taunts that oft I have endured .
I would I could see this taborer .
Well .
They are entirely welcome .
I know thee well .
And will you , being a man of your breeding , be married under a bush like a beggar ?
It may be I shall raise you by and by On business to my brother Cassius .
Hear the noble Antony .
Even this repays me. , We sent our schoolmaster .
Nay , you need not fear us , Lorenzo .
For certainly thou art so near the gulf Thou needs must be englutted .
Sir , the gods Will have it thus .
But better service have I never done you Than now to bid you hold .
To feed my humor , wish thyself no harm .
What shall be our sport , then ?
Come now , your promise .
And here he stands .
She was too fond of her most filthy bargain .
Great business must be wrought ere noon .
Come away , servant , come .
I pray you , is my master yet returned ?
Faith , we met and found the quarrel was upon the seventh cause .
Every one that does so is a traitor and must be hanged .
Very well , my lord .
Full many a lady I have eyed with best regard and many a time
You are welcome .
For Brutus ' sake , I am beholding to you .
Tis he .
We , ignorant of ourselves , Beg often our own harms , which the wise powers Deny us for our good , so find we profit By losing of our prayers .
It is good for your green wound and your ploody coxcomb .
Sblood , an arrant traitor as any 's in the universal world , or in France , or in England !
It is a poison tempered by himself .
No "master , " sir , but a poor man's son .
Tarry , Petruchio , I must go with thee , For in Baptista's keep my treasure is .
Here's the friar ready .
Sir , she can turn , and turn , and yet go on , And turn again .
He is in heaven , where thou shalt never come .
What , man , courage yet !
Alas now , pray you , Work not so hard .
O sir , you are old .
For the heavens , rouse up a brave mind , " says the fiend , "and run." Well , my conscience , hanging about the neck of my heart , says very wisely to me , "My honest friend Launcelot , being an honest man's son" , or rather an honest woman's son , for indeed my father did something smack , something grow to .
Ay , my good lord .
Tis true indeed , so your daughter says .
Anon we'll drink a measure The table round .
I hear a knocking At the south entry .
Favors ?
I take this offer then : pay the bond thrice And let the Christian go .
Who hath measured the ground ?
His eyes are red as fire with weeping .
The night has been unruly .
Cassius , Be not deceived .
When he came to himself again , he said , if he had done or said anything amiss , he desired their worships to think it was his infirmity .
Fetch me the handkerchief , my mind misgives .
What treasure , uncle ?
Of all the wonders that I yet have heard , It seems to me most strange that men should fear , Seeing that death , a necessary end , Will come when it will come .
I thank you ; and be blessed for your good comfort .
But know that I have tonight wooed Margaret , the Lady Hero's gentlewoman , by the name of Hero .
The sky , it seems , would pour down stinking pitch , But that the sea , mounting to th ' welkin's cheek , Dashes the fire out .
Oh !
What says this leaden casket ?
Out o ' th ' moon , I do assure thee .
What did you enact ?
Go , fetch me something : I'll break ope the gate .
In your dumps ?
This is a most majestic vision , and Harmonious charmingly .
Hillo , ho , ho , boy .
I am bound by oath , and therefore pardon me .
If Caesar please , our master Will leap to be his friend .
How now , masters ?
Go and commend me to my brother Cassius .
Fie !
What is here ?
Yet I'll not shed her blood , Nor scar that whiter skin of hers than snow And smooth as monumental alabaster .
This way will I. Disrobe the images If you do find them decked with ceremonies .
Hence !
Therefore , hear me , Hermia .
Marry , sir , in her buttocks .
We do not come as minding to contest you , Our true intent is .
How now , my lord !
I have Immortal longings in me .
Am not I your Rosalind ?
If swift thought break it not , a swifter mean Shall outstrike thought , but thought will do 't , I feel .
Tis very much .
What love could press Lysander from my side ?
Didst thou not hear a noise ?
Sirrah , come hither : 'tis no time to jest , And therefore frame your manners to the time .
Ay , but , lady , That policy may either last so long , Or feed upon such nice and waterish diet , Or breed itself so out of circumstances , That , I being absent and my place supplied , My general will forget my love and service .
Now to you .
Then fly !
Not a whit .
Looked he or red or pale , or sad or merrily ?
Keep close , I thee command .
But first I'll turn yon fellow in his grave And then return lamenting to my love .
And mine , but it grows something stale with me .
Dear master , I can go no further .
Yet if thou say Antony lives , is well , Or friends with Caesar , or not captive to him , I'll set thee in a shower of gold and hail Rich pearls upon thee .
Speak the word along .
My lord , I think I saw him yesternight .
But this is most falliable , the worm's an odd worm .
Wherein went he ?
In his livery Walked crowns and crownets .
I am out of all other tune , methinks .
Ay , marry , was 't , and he put it by thrice , every time gentler than other , and at every putting-by mine honest neighbors shouted .
I knew you at the first You were a moveable .
Now , I'll stand to it , the pancakes were naught and the mustard was good , and yet was not the knight forsworn .
Who then shall blame His pestered senses to recoil and start , When all that is within him does condemn Itself for being there ?
I do not know , my lord , what I should think .
Oh , farewell !
I speak not as in absolute fear of you .
John Duke of Norfolk , Walter , Lord Ferrers , Sir Robert Brakenbury , and Sir William Brandon .
God bless thee , and put meekness in thy breast , Love , charity , obedience , and true duty .
Oh !
May we be gone ?
Death of one person can be paid but once , And that she has discharged .
Speak , hands , for me !
Lechery , sir , it provokes and unprovokes .
And not a jot of "Tranio" in your mouth .
With cunning hast thou filched my daughter's heart , Turned her obedience ( which is due to me ) To stubborn harshness. , And , my gracious duke , Be it so she will not here before your grace Consent to marry with Demetrius , I beg the ancient privilege of Athens .
Go , bid the huntsmen wake them with their horns .
Your serpent of Egypt is bred now of your mud by the operation of your sun .
I frown upon him , yet he loves me still .
Pleaseth your Grace To appoint some of your council presently To sit with us once more with better heed To resurvey them , we will suddenly Pass our accept and peremptory answer .
Else the Puck a liar call .
Hers you are .
Caesar , I never stood on ceremonies , Yet now they fright me .
By heaven , you do me wrong !
Madam , it so fell out , that certain players We o'erraught on the way .
He married but his occasion here .
Well said .
He were an excellent man that were made just in the midway between him and Benedick .
O thou bloody prison , Fatal and ominous to noble peers !
Is he not approved in the height a villain , that hath slandered , scorned , dishonored my kinswoman ?
Hail , king !
For what advancement may I hope from thee That no revenue hast but thy good spirits , To feed and clothe thee ?
Have the pioneers given o'er ?
Come , sir , what letters had you late from France ?
Th ' occasion speaks thee , and My strong imagination sees a crown Dropping upon thy head .
Tomorrow dinner , then ?
Thou 'rt kind .
What good is covered with the face of heaven , To be discovered , that can do me good ?
I can not find it .
I am your host .
Tell me at whose suit .
Oh , is 't come to this ?
Good morrow , good Lieutenant .
And here's a marvelous convenient place for our rehearsal .
Use your authority .
Nothing is good , I see , without respect .
In the meantime , Let me be thought too busy in my fears , As worthy cause I have to fear I am , And hold her free , I do beseech your honor .
Ay , lord .
Why , how should she be murdered ?
Who intercepts my expedition ?
Young Edward lives ; think now what I would speak .
At my lodging .
Sir ?
Thou seest we are not all alone unhappy .
We have cause to be glad that matters are so well digested .
I will leave him .
Ay , at Philippi .
I do beseech you To understand my purposes aright .
Hence .
Oh well done !
Which I take to be either a fool or a cipher .
Come , you look paler and paler .
Ah , women , women !
Thou hast hit it .
The Moor's abused by some most villainous knave , Some base notorious knave , some scurvy fellow .
Call !
Let it be so .
And I .
But I do think it is their husbands ' faults If wives do fall .
Where be these bloody thieves ?
No , it is not possible you should love the enemy of France , Kate .
Some good I mean to do Despite of mine own nature .
What can it not ?
One of these three contains her heavenly picture .
Good heaven , the souls of all my tribe defend From jealousy !
If I last in this service , you must case me in leather .
It is his hand , my lord , but I hope his heart is not in the contents .
With all my heart .
Why no , no more than reason .
My father's death , Thy life hath it dishonored .
Here is my journey's end , here is my butt , And very sea-mark of my utmost sail .
When I told you My state was nothing , I should then have told you That I was worse than nothing , for indeed I have engaged myself to a dear friend , Engaged my friend to his mere enemy To feed my means .
Therefore be double damned , Swear thou art honest !
But , in faith , Kate , the elder I wax , the better I shall appear .
I'll not fail , if I live .
Pray you , avoid it .
I will compound this strife .
If I should be ?
This note doth tell me of ten thousand French That in the field lie slain .
What , shall we toward the Tower ?
Pray thee , marry us .
Sure , I think so , And therefore certainly it were not good She knew his love , lest she make sport at it .
So should we you , if you should be our king .
Go you down that way towards the Capitol .
Then , with your will , go on .
Five summers have I spent in farthest Greece , Roaming clean through the bounds of Asia , And , coasting homeward , came to Ephesus , Hopeless to find , yet loath to leave unsought Or that or any place that harbors men .
With bills on their necks : "Be it known unto all men by these presents." The eldest of the three wrestled with Charles , the duke's wrestler , which Charles in a moment threw him and broke three of his ribs , that there is little hope of life in him .
That he might not beteem the winds of heaven Visit her face too roughly. , Heaven and earth , Must I remember ?
Why should he not ?
Who keeps her company ?
How is it , general ?
Pardon the frankness of my mirth if I answer you for that .
Is it your dear friend that is thus in trouble ?
Oh , fie upon thee , strumpet !
Now go we in content To liberty , and not to banishment .
What should he be ?
Gone , sir .
Therefore my merchandise makes me not sad .
Good gentlemen , give him a further edge , And drive his purpose on to these delights .
Oh , I am slain !
God hath blessed you with a good name .
And die in music .
Hence !
Now my spirit is going .
Good faith , good faith , the saying did not hold In him that did object the same to thee !
I know it pleaseth neither of us well .
Our brother is imprisoned by your means , Myself disgraced , and the nobility Held in contempt , while great promotions Are daily given to ennoble those That scarce some two days since were worth a noble .
And what other oath Than honesty to honesty engaged , That this shall be , or we will fall for it ?
And therefore , like herself , wise , fair and true , Shall she be placed in my constant soul .
As it determines , so Dissolve my life !
Yea , and paid me richly for the practice of it .
You have been hotly called for .
Wilt thou , Strato ?
I'll speak a prophecy ere I go .
Would it were day !
Had we fought , I doubt we should have been too young for them .
The more I love , the more he hateth me .
I did .
How likes Gremio these quick-witted folks ?
Good !
Come hither , come !
Were I in England now , as once I was , and had but this fish painted , not a holiday fool there but would give a piece of silver .
I thought thy heart had been wounded with the claws of a lion .
Then let your will attend on their accords .
My liege , I am advised what I say , Neither disturbed with the effect of wine , Nor heady-rash , provoked with raging ire , Albeit my wrongs might make one wiser mad .
Then every soldier kill his prisoners .
An interlude !
Come , come .
Motley's the only wear .
They have all stomachs .
There's some conceit or other likes him well When that he bids good morrow with such spirit .
No , 'twas the vane on the house .
Your castle is surprised , your wife and babes Savagely slaughtered .
Thy Edward he is dead , that killed my Edward , Thy other Edward dead , to quit my Edward ; Young York , he is but boot , because both they Matched not the high perfection of my loss .
Ay , but the feet were lame and could not bear themselves without the verse , and therefore stood lamely in the verse .
Why , I pray you ?
True , my lord .
I give it you .
Call to me All my sad captains .
Take him on the costard with the hilts of thy sword , and then throw him into the malmsey butt in the next room .
No , I'll not weep .
Call forth my household servants .
Which , when I saw rehearsed , I must confess , Made mine eyes water , but more merry tears The passion of loud laughter never shed .
I'll be your foil , Laertes .
You will take little delight in it , I can tell you , there is such odds in the man .
You gentle Romans , Peace , ho !
I wonder what it bodes .
How shall we find the concord of this discord ?
I would do much T ' atone them , for the love I bear to Cassio .
A many of our bodies shall no doubt Find native graves , upon the which , I trust , Shall witness live in brass of this day's work .
This was a venture , sir , that Jacob served for , A thing not in his power to bring to pass But swayed and fashioned by the hand of heaven .
One doth not know How much an ill word may empoison liking .
Marry , he told me so himself ; and he said he cared not who knew it .
It is my fashion , when I see a crab .
She is not , madam .
Lies all within. , Deliver me the key .
Tis very like .
If this be so , why blame you me to love you ?
Letters , my lord , from Hamlet .
And I have heard Apollodorus carried , What , I pray you ?
Is 't possible that on so little acquaintance you should like her ?
There's nothing in her yet .
I have not 'scaped drowning to be afeard now of your four legs .
This green plot shall be our stage , this hawthorn-brake our tiring-house , and we will do it in action as we will do it before the duke .
I shall grow jealous of you shortly , Launcelot , if you thus get my wife into corners .
Tis but a man gone .
I can not tell .
Here's a madman will murder me .
Thou shalt be pinched As thick as honeycomb , each pinch more stinging Than bees that made 'em .
Why , sir , I trust I may have leave to speak , And speak I will .
In his tongue .
O , never Shall sun that morrow see !
Why dost thou lash that whore ?
He hath an uncle here in Messina will be very much glad of it .
I would it might be hangers till then .
When thou wakest , if she be by , Beg of her for remedy .
They are not near my conscience .
What's the noise ?
With good acceptance of his Majesty , Save that there was not time enough to hear , As I perceived his Grace would fain have done , The severals and unhidden passages Of his true titles to some certain dukedoms , And generally to the crown and seat of France , Derived from Edward , his great-grandfather .
I found them on a tree .
With much , much more dismay I view the fight than thou that makest the fray .
They would else have been troubled with a pernicious suitor .
My creditors grow cruel .
Defend thee !
Be attentive .
O Cassius , I am sick of many griefs .
Revenge .
Ah , cut my lace asunder , That my pent heart may have some scope to beat , Or else I swoon with this dead-killing news !
Go , bind this man , for he is frantic too .
I have promised to make all this matter even .
He's married .
But indeed an old religious uncle of mine taught me to speak , who was in his youth an inland man , one that knew courtship too well , for there he fell in love .
He dies !
With meditating that she must die once , I have the patience to endure it now .
My name's Macbeth .
Dear Kate , you and I can not be confined within the weak list of a country's fashion .
I know thee well enough .
Why , this is a more exquisite song than the other .
Alas , then she is drowned .
If you do fight against your country's foes , Your country's fat shall pay your pains the hire .
Ha , ha , are you honest ?
Belike this show imports the argument of the play .
She were an excellent wife for Benedict .
Behold the threaden sails , Borne with th ' invisible and creeping wind , Draw the huge bottoms through the furrowed sea , Breasting the lofty surge .
Three times today my foot-cloth horse did stumble , And started when he looked upon the Tower , As loath to bear me to the slaughterhouse .
Why , how now , monsieur ?
A sovereign shame so elbows him .
I will do so .
You are their heir , you sit upon their throne , The blood and courage that renowned them Runs in your veins ; and my thrice-puissant liege Is in the very May-morn of his youth , Ripe for exploits and mighty enterprises .
At Crosby Place , there shall you find us both .
It is no shame .
I will show you such a necessity in his death that you shall think yourself bound to put it on him .
They swore that you were almost sick for me .
Melt Egypt into Nile , and kindly creatures Turn all to serpents .
Very well .
The advancement of your children , gentle lady .
Who's there ?
I will stand , and so shall Trinculo .
You need not fear , lady , the having any of these lords .
Tis worse than murder To do upon respect such violent outrage .
At your noble pleasure .
Upon my power I may dismiss this court , Unless Bellario , a learned doctor , Whom I have sent for to determine this , Come here today .
Pray , write down , "Borachio." , Yours , sirrah ?
If he will not stand when he is bidden , he is none of the Prince's subjects .
What needs more words ?
He says , my lord , your daughter is not well .
Never make known what you have seen tonight .
Come hither , herald. , Let the trumpet sound , , And read out this .
I will challenge him .
Yours in the ranks of death .
Do you speak in the sick tune ?
Within this three mile may you see it coming ; I say , a moving grove .
I say thy husband .
Indeed he is not fit .
Not till God make men of some other metal than earth .
And yours of Helena to me bequeath , Whom I do love and will do till my death .
The general speaks to you .
Some tender money to me ; some invite me ; Some other give me thanks for kindnesses ; Some offer me commodities to buy .
And be a happy mother by the deed .
Can he be angry ?
Stay , give me drink. , Hamlet , this pearl is thine .
Inform her full of my particular fear , And thereto add such reasons of your own As may compact it more .
Return you to my sister .
Best safety lies in fear .
Then you are a better than the king .
Music , ho !
Let's away And get our jewels and our wealth together , Devise the fittest time and safest way To hide us from pursuit that will be made After my flight .
He is a dreamer .
So they do nothing , 'tis a venial slip .
Adieu , good Queen .
Fare thee well , nymph .
But why should honor outlive honesty ?
Let no such man be trusted .
The thoughts of people .
Thou shalt not back till I have borne this corse Into the marketplace .
Help to dress me , good coz , good Meg , good Ursula .
Was it so late , friend , ere you went to bed , That you do lie so late ?
The king would speak with Cornwall .
You shall , my lord .
Tis a worthy governor .
If we are marked to die , we are enough To do our country loss ; and if to live , The fewer men , the greater share of honor .
I know his trumpet .
True , sir .
He smiled and said "The better for our purpose." He was in the right , and so indeed it is .
If that same demon that hath gulled thee thus Should with his lion gait walk the whole world , He might return to vasty Tartar back And tell the legions "I can never win A soul so easy as that Englishman's." Oh , how hast thou with jealousy infected The sweetness of affiance !
Yes , certainly , and out of doubt and out of question , too , and ambiguities .
Would I were able to load him with his desert !
Slave !
Would they had stayed .
Such have but a shadow's bliss .
Here it is , I think .
While that the armed hand doth fight abroad , Th ' advised head defends itself at home .
There lies your way .
Would ?
Here do I choose , and thrive I as I may !
Did he take interest ?
Therefore , O Antony , stay not by his side .
I could say she were worse .
I told you , sir , they were red-hot with drinking , So full of valor that they smote the air For breathing in their faces , beat the ground For kissing of their feet , yet always bending Towards their project .
And so it is .
Drones hive not with me .
Yet the gold bides still That others touch , and often touching will Wear gold ; yet no man that hath a name By falsehood and corruption doth it shame .
What is he that you ask for , niece ?
But hollow men , like horses hot at hand , Make gallant show and promise of their mettle .
In , or we are spoiled .
You call me misbeliever , cutthroat dog , And spet upon my Jewish gaberdine , And all for use of that which is mine own .
Do it .
Look to my chattels and my movables .
I'll keep my oath Patiently to bear my wroth."
Demetrius loves your fair .
You , as your business and desire shall point you , For every man has business and desire , Such as it is , and for my own poor part , Look you , I'll go pray .
Look where they come .
Now your jest is earnest .
I will not trouble you As yet to question you about your fortunes. , Give us some music , and , good cousin , sing .
We'll be friends first .
Tis three o'clock , and , Romans , yet ere night We shall try fortune in a second fight .
Ay , my good lord .
I am dumb .
See , they encounter thee with their hearts ' thanks .
I say I love thee more than he can do .
Farewell .
It is no matter .
Speak , man .
What , we have many goodly days to see !
The will !
Let him cry , "Praise and glory on his head ! " For forth he goes and visits all his host , Bids them good morrow with a modest smile , And calls them brothers , friends , and countrymen .
I'll fight till from my bones my flesh be hacked .
Most savage and unnatural !
She dies for 't. , Eros , ho !
So are the Prince and Claudio , who accused her Upon the error that you heard debated .
Tis said , man , and farewell .
For I am Trinculo , be not afeard , thy good friend Trinculo .
Thus we are agreed .
The even mead , that erst brought sweetly forth The freckled cowslip , burnet , and green clover , Wanting the scythe , withal uncorrected , rank , Conceives by idleness , and nothing teems But hateful docks , rough thistles , kecksies , burrs , Losing both beauty and utility .
How "strangely" ?
Well then , sustain me .
Tis vile , unless it may be quaintly ordered , And better in my mind not undertook .
Why ?
Fair ladies , you drop manna in the way Of starved people .
And my help .
He cries for you , and vows , if he can take you , To scorch your face and to disfigure you .
This is mere madness .
Pray you come in .
I ' faith , i ' faith , and both in a tune like two gypsies on a horse .
Good morrow , noble sir .
Peter Quince , What sayest thou , bully Bottom ?
Oh , strange !
Then if he lose he makes a swanlike end , Fading in music .
How ?
And I have reason for it .
I , gentle mistress .
But , sirrah , mark , we use To say the dead are well .
Your husband being troubled with a shrew Measures my husband's sorrow by his woe .
My falcon now is sharp and passing empty , And , till she stoop , she must not be full-gorged , For then she never looks upon her lure .
Prithee say true !
Worthy Montano , you were wont be civil .
Face not me .
How am I then a villain To counsel Cassio to this parallel course , Directly to his good ?
I am glad on 't .
See , it stalks away .
My master's mind .
O most happy hour !
All's hushed as midnight yet .
Didst not mark that ?
She's the worse for all this .
You were the word of war .
When I presented Ceres , I thought to have told thee of it , but I feared Lest I might anger thee .
Abide within .
I had forgot the reward .
We will , my noble lord .
Natures of such deep trust we shall much need .
Good morrow , worthy Caesar .
Ay , madam .
Alas , what cry is that ?
Be brief , lest that the process of thy kindness Last longer telling than thy kindness ' date .
Now take them up , " quoth he , "if any list." Trembled and shook , for why he stamped and swore As if the vicar meant to cozen him .
Ay , my lord .
I never gave him any .
Upon condition Publius shall not live , Who is your sister's son , Mark Antony .
Miserable England , I prophesy the fearfull'st time to thee That ever wretched age hath looked upon. , Come , lead me to the block .
Well then , Legitimate Edgar , I must have your land .
Now , by the world , 'T is full of thy foul wrongs .
Edmund , seek him out , wind me into him , I pray you .
What do you mean To dote thus on such luggage ?
At seventeen years , many their fortunes seek , But at fourscore , it is too late a week .
I am very glad of it .
Good night , good brother .
Their shadows seem A canopy most fatal , under which Our army lies , ready to give up the ghost .
Ay , madam .
Stand !
Sir , sir , I will have law in Ephesus , To your notorious shame , I doubt it not .
It came even from the heart of , oh , she's dead !
No marvel , lord , though it affrighted you .
I charge thee , tempt me not .
No , madam .
Teach it but how , And thou shalt see how apt it is to learn Any hard lesson that may do thee good .
Was this fair paper , this most goodly book , Made to write "whore" upon ?
And may not young men die as well as old ?
Thou hotly lust'st to use her in that kind For which thou whipp'st her .
We have two hours To furnish us .
We'll draw cuts for the signior .
O , name him not .
If 'twere not she , I can not tell who told me .
I am a Jew .
You shall hear me .
I had myself notice of my brother's purpose herein and have by underhand means labored to dissuade him from it ; but he is resolute .
Is the duke of Exeter safe ?
How does my old acquaintance of this isle ? , Honey , you shall be well desired in Cyprus , I have found great love amongst them .
If any , speak , for him have I offended .
Regan , I think you are .
Shall I abide In this dull world , which in thy absence is No better than a sty ?
Come on .
She that was ever fair and never proud , Had tongue at will and yet was never loud , Never lacked gold and yet went never gay , Fled from her wish and yet said "Now I may , " She that being angered , her revenge being nigh , Bade her wrong stay and her displeasure fly , She that in wisdom never was so frail To change the cod's head for the salmon's tail , She that could think and ne'er disclose her mind , See suitors following and not look behind , She was a wight , if ever such wights were , To do what ?
But were I Brutus , And Brutus Antony , there were an Antony Would ruffle up your spirits and put a tongue In every wound of Caesar that should move The stones of Rome to rise and mutiny .
Your eyes are lodestars , and your tongue's sweet air More tunable than lark to shepherd's ear When wheat is green , when hawthorn buds appear .
The mighty gods defend thee !
But are they , Ariel , safe ?
I will give treason his payment into plows , I warrant you .
Oh , this is the poison of deep grief .
How prove you that in the great heap of your knowledge ?
He shall taste of my bottle .
I will verify as much in his beard .
An unauthorized kiss !
I shall desire you of more acquaintance , good Master Cobweb .
Why art thou here , Come from the farthest step of India ?
Lord of lords !
He .
I shall offend , either to detain or give it .
Thou art in a parlous state , shepherd .
Harp on it still shall I till heart-strings break .
Whither ?
Thank God." A good answer .
She is indeed perfection .
O , she that might have intercepted thee , By strangling thee in her accursed womb , From all the slaughters , wretch , that thou hast done .
O Dardanius !
You are gentlemen of brave mettle .
Tarry , sweet soul , for mine ; then fly abreast , As in this glorious and well-foughten field We kept together in our chivalry." Upon these words I came and cheered him up .
With all my heart , so thou canst get a wife .
It is my day , my life .
So will you say when you have seen the sequel .
Thou runaway , thou coward , art thou fled ?
But first I will release the fairy queen .
At sea , I think .
Can you deny all this ?
Why , this is not a boon , 'T is as I should entreat you wear your gloves , Or feed on nourishing dishes , or keep you warm , Or sue to you to do a peculiar profit To your own person .
How canst thou woo her ?
With no sauce that can be devised to it .
I'll board him presently .
Let him thank me , that holp to send him thither , For he was fitter for that place than earth .
Why then , the beef , and let the mustard rest .
My cake is dough , but I'll in among the rest , Out of hope of all but my share of the feast .
Think so , Iago ?
I'll cross it though it blast me. , Stay , illusion !
Nor in thine , lord .
Go to , go to. , Come hither , sir .
Francis Flute , the bellows-mender ?
It is a theme as fluent as the sea .
Bear me forthwith unto his creditor , And , knowing how the debt grows , I will pay it. , Good Master Doctor , see him safe conveyed Home to my house .
Take him hence .
That I have , lady .
Come , go with me .
There will we rehearse , for if we meet in the city we shall be dogged with company , and our devices known .
Thou didst it excellent .
Madam , I will .
Thou shalt serve me .
Sound them , it doth become the mouth as well .
I'll prove mine honor and mine honesty Against thee presently if thou dar'st stand .
Oh , yes , I heard them all , and more too , for some of them had in them more feet than the verses would bear .
Right true it is your son Lucentio here Doth love my daughter and she loveth him , Or both dissemble deeply their affections .

To Dover .
I Beyond all limit of what else i ' th ' world Do love , prize , honor you .
The same .
Fie , fie on all tired jades , on all mad masters , and all foul ways !
Pray you , if it be , give it me , for I am slow of study .
And did they bid you tell her of it , madam ?
Othello's occupation's gone .
Why ?
Ah , dear , if I be so , From my cold heart let heaven engender hail , And poison it in the source , and the first stone Drop in my neck .
They'll have me whipped for speaking true , thou'lt have me whipped for lying , and sometimes I am whipped for holding my peace .
What might you think ?

Richard loves Richard ; that is , I and I .
Why , a horse .

I am sorry .
Now fear I this will give it start again .
News , old news , and such news as you never heard of !
I do not think it good .
O Lord , methought what pain it was to drown , What dreadful noise of waters in my ears , What sights of ugly death within my eyes .
Let 'em enter .

What may she not ?
True .
What ?
Say on , my loving lord .
Well , sir .
He will come straight .
For once upon a raw and gusty day , The troubled Tiber chafing with her shores , Caesar said to me , "Darest thou , Cassius , now Leap in with me into this angry flood And swim to yonder point ? " Upon the word , Accoutred as I was , I plunged in And bade him follow .

I had else been perfect , Whole as the marble , founded as the rock , As broad and general as the casing air .
Death , traitor !
Is it a true thing ?
And will you rent our ancient love asunder To join with men in scorning your poor friend ?

Therefore You will not pay for the glasses you have burst ?

I can not be so partial , Goneril , To the great love I bear you , Pray you , content .
The old priest at Saint Luke's Church is at your command at all hours .
My father , methinks I see my father .
And have not we affections , Desires for sport , and frailty , as men have ?
So do you too , where you perceive them thick .
Let us not break with him , For he will never follow anything That other men begin .
He that stirs next to carve for his own rage Holds his soul light , he dies upon his motion .
Tush , Gremio .
Four days will quickly steep themselves in night .

I'll never care what wickedness I do , If this man come to good .
No , my good lord .
He shall kill two of us , and men indeed , But that's no matter .

My lord .
Ay , I do .
I protest I love thee .
If I can cross him any way , I bless myself every way .
If I do prove her haggard , Though that her jesses were my dear heartstrings , I'd whistle her off and let her down the wind To prey at fortune .
The third o' th' world is yours , which with a snaffle You may pace easy , but not such a wife .
Bring him before us .
Say I am sick .
Oh , excellent !
Ah , thou spell !
Then say at once what is it thou requests .
Believe me , I had rather have lost my purse Full of crusadoes .
Be gentle to her .
Such a mad marriage never was before .
Where is my gracious lord of Canterbury ?
Thus have I politicly begun my reign , And 'tis my hope to end successfully .
I wish him joy of her .

In weightier things you'll say a beggar nay .
Fetch me an iron crow .
Farewell , sweet lord , and sister .
I know it is the sun that shines so bright .

Yes , I have gained my experience .
This is as strange a maze as e'er men trod , And there is in this business more than nature Was ever conduct of .
Get thee to bed , Francisco .
How now , sir ?
Not a jot , not a jot .

Ready , my lord .
Moneys is your suit .
Dost thou mock me ?
Had he a hand to write this , a heart and brain to breed it in ?
Come , help to bear thy master .
No , faith , hate him not , for my sake .
Thou art sensible in nothing but blows , and so is an ass .

And what art thou , thou idol ceremony ?
Coldhearted toward me ?
For I am sick when I do look on thee .
Oh , he hath murdered his master !
This blows my heart .
Fie , Fie , lieutenant , You'll be ashamed for ever .
The laws are mine , not thine .
Know you not the cause ?
Fie , what a question's that If thou wert near a lewd interpreter !
This wretch hath part confessed his villainy .
Are they married , think you ?
I trouble thee too much , but thou art willing .
They say you are a melancholy fellow .
Who goes there , ha ?
Why does the world report that Kate doth limp ?
Oh , that I were a fool !
I partly guess , for I have loved ere now .
Our masquing mates by this time for us stay .
I'll talk with this good fellow .
You cloudy princes and heart-sorrowing peers That bear this heavy mutual load of moan , Now cheer each other in each other's love .
I do remember now .

But yet , madam , I do not like "But yet." It does allay The good precedence .
Live a thousand years , I shall not find myself so apt to die .
It is well .
His absence , sir , Lays blame upon his promise .
Is 't so , my lords of England ?
O Lorenzo , If thou keep promise , I shall end this strife , Become a Christian and thy loving wife .
Ay , sir ; there are a crew of wretched souls That stay his cure .
Away !
How chance thou art returned so soon ?
What would my lord ?
I'll be with thee betimes .
Remember what I have said .
Their lips were four red roses on a stalk , And in their summer beauty kissed each other .
God's will and His pleasure , Captain , I beseech you now , come apace to the king .
Let me see , what think you of falling in love ?
Then must you speak Of one that loved not wisely , but too well .
He is unqualitied with very shame .
To these injunctions every one doth swear That comes to hazard for my worthless self .
Go charge my goblins that they grind their joints With dry convulsions , shorten up their sinews With aged cramps , and more pinch-spotted make them Than pard or cat o ' mountain .
I have made it for you .
For indeed , who would set his wit to so foolish a bird ?
Here comes other reck'nings .
Look who comes here .
Three kings I had newly feasted , and did want Of what I was i' th' morning .
Of Mantua .
Though it pass your patience and mine to endure her loud alarums , why , man , there be good fellows in the world , an a man could light on them , would take her with all faults , and money enough .
Her hedges , even-pleached , Like prisoners wildly overgrown with hair , Put forth disordered twigs .
Yare , lower , lower !
Hath any man seen him at the barber's ?
Tis truly so .
It curvets unseasonably .
I think 'twas Soto that your Honor means .

Fulvia is dead .
But thou must needs be sure My spirits and my place have in their power To make this bitter to thee .

Tis true , my liege ; this ring I had of her .
My uncle ?
Many a man his life hath sold But my outside to behold .
Against my brother Lucius ?
If either of you know any inward impediment why you should not be conjoined , charge you on your souls to utter it .

There's a strong fellow , Menas .
What's thy name ?
It were a tedious difficulty , I think , To bring them to that prospect .
The man is innocent .
What's your name , friend ?
Thou art a soldier only .
Good , speak to th ' mariners .
Good Lord for alliance !
He knows not what he says , and vain it is That we present us to him .
So please you , we will stand and watch your pleasure .
This shall make Our purpose necessary and not envious , Which so appearing to the common eyes , We shall be called purgers , not murderers .
If I stand here , I saw him .
We all stand up against the spirit of Caesar , And in the spirit of men there is no blood .
No matter whither , so you come not here .
Nay , then you lie .
I hope you do not mean to cheat me so .
If your leisure served , I would speak with you .
Is my master and his wife coming , Grumio ?
I but believe it partly , For I am fresh of spirit and resolved To meet all perils very constantly .
We will meet , and there we may rehearse most obscenely and courageously .

It is the right butter-women's rank to market .
Fare you well .
Indeed , he plied them both with excellent praises .
Tomorrow , my lord .
Why , there's more gold .
No matter , since They have left their viands behind , for we have stomachs .
But if he be at hand I shall be satisfied .
Happy indeed , as we have spent the day .
No , to my cabin .
Good morrow to my sovereign king and queen , And , princely peers , a happy time of day .
You draw me , you hard-hearted adamant .
What tidings can you tell me of my lord ?
Ready .
What's he that wishes so ?
How know you he loves her ?
Let her live To join our kingdoms and our hearts , and never Fly off our loves again !
Sir , I shall meet your wit in the career , an you charge it against me .
I hear my father coming .
The bloody proclamation to escape , That followed me so near , O our lives ' sweetness ,
Who knows not he is dead !
And so will I .
Now the witch take me if I meant it thus !
So please you , for I never heard it yet , Yet heard too much of Phoebe's cruelty .
Wherefore throng you hither ?
Ah , poor heart , he is so shaked of a burning quotidian tertian that it is most lamentable to behold .
Then thou art damned .
Peaseblossom .
That's a fault that water will mend .
Whither am I going ?
Why , no , sir .
Just as high as my heart .
By Jupiter , Were I the wearer of Antonio's beard , I would not shave 't today .
No ?
Tomorrow , Caesar , I shall be furnished to inform you rightly Both what by sea and land I can be able To front this present time .
Did ever Dian so become a grove As Kate this chamber with her princely gait ?
This is the excellent foppery of the world that when we are sick in fortune , often the surfeit of our own behavior , we make guilty of our disasters the sun , the moon , and the stars , as if we were villains by necessity , fools by heavenly compulsion , knaves , thieves , and treachers by spherical predominance , drunkards , liars , and adulterers by an enforced obedience of planetary influence , and all that we are evil in by a divine thrusting-on .
Instance , briefly .
Farewell , good Salisbury , and good luck go with thee .
I owe you none till I receive the chain .
Swounds , show me what thou'lt do .
Come apace , good Audrey .
Good madam , patience .
Swear priests and cowards and men cautelous , Old feeble carrions and such suffering souls That welcome wrongs .
This disease is beyond my practice .
Those linen cheeks of thine Are counselors to fear .
Hoo !
Is that the law ?
An inviting eye , and yet methinks right modest .
At your choice , sir .
Thank you .
Nay , I will do so .
Madam , good night .
What wouldst thou with us ?
But now I see our lances are but straws , Our strength as weak , our weakness past compare , That seeming to be most which we indeed least are .
How goes 't ?
You speak too bitterly .
Pass .
For I am he am born to tame you , Kate , And bring you from a wild Kate to a Kate Conformable as other household Kates .
He had none .
My lord , I hold my life as dear as you do yours , And never in my days , I do protest , Was it so precious to me as 'tis now .
In him your comfort lives .
Now by my George , my Garter , and my crown , Profaned , dishonored , and the third usurped .
It must be so , for miracles are ceased , And therefore we must needs admit the means How things are perfected .
It can not be but thou hast murdered him .
Swallows have built In Cleopatra's sails their nests .

Was that done like Cassius ?
Good .
My sister may receive it much more worse To have her gentleman abused , assaulted For following her affairs. , Put in his legs .
Let me see , let me see .
They have in England A coin that bears the figure of an angel Stamped in gold , but that's insculped upon .
How is 't ?
Therefore give me no counsel .
What should a man do but be merry ?
You shall play it in a mask , and you may speak as small as you will .
The fault , dear Brutus , is not in our stars But in ourselves , that we are underlings .
My husband !
To serve me well , you all should do me duty : Teach me to be your queen , and you my subjects .
And as our vineyards , fallows , meads , and hedges , Defective in their natures , grow to wildness , Even so our houses and ourselves and children Have lost , or do not learn for want of time , The sciences that should become our country , But grow like savages , as soldiers will
Sir , amen .
Amen , amen to that fair prayer , say I .
My way is now to hie home to his house And tell his wife that , being lunatic , He rushed into my house and took perforce My ring away .
And begged he pardon ?
I'll tell my husband , Launcelot , what you say .
Caesar , my lord .
If you'll sit down , I'll bear your logs the while .
It was my duty , sir .
So says the Prince and my new-trothed lord .
That will I do .
We'll know all our fortunes .
You've strange serpents there ?
Why let it strike ?
What , are Ancient Pistol and you friends yet ?
Doth Fortune play the huswife with me now ?

Orlando ?
Go , and bring them .
Oh , let the heavens Give him defense against the elements , For I have lost him on a dangerous sea .
But I'll not chide thee .
Is his head worth a hat or his chin worth a beard ?
Your hand , Leonato .
My lord , they stay for you to give your daughter to her husband .
Why had I not with charitable hand Took up a beggar's issue at my gates , Who , smirched thus , and mired with infamy , I might have said , "No part of it is mine ; This shame derives itself from unknown loins" ?
The duke of York commends him to your Majesty .
I could well wish courtesy would invent some other custom of entertainment .
For do but stand upon the foaming shore , The chidden billow seems to pelt the clouds , The wind-shaked surge , with high and monstrous mane , Seems to cast water on the burning bear , And quench the guards of th ' ever-fixed pole .
My lord , I have considered in my mind The late request that you did sound me in .
Let their beds Be made as soft as yours and let their palates Be seasoned with such viands" ?
No , Corin , being old , thou canst not guess , Though in thy youth thou wast as true a lover As ever sighed upon a midnight pillow .

Hang him instantly .
For 'tis most easy Th ' inclining Desdemona to subdue In any honest suit .

What do you think of me ?
Do so .
The age is grown so picked that the toe of the peasant comes so near the heel of the courtier he galls his kibe. , How long hast thou been a grave-maker ?
As they pass by , pluck Casca by the sleeve , And he will , after his sour fashion , tell you What hath proceeded worthy note today .
The enemy , marching along by them , By them shall make a fuller number up , Come on refreshed , new-added , and encouraged , From which advantage shall we cut him off If at Philippi we do face him there , These people at our back .
How if your husband start some otherwhere ?
If it pass against us , We lose the better half of our possession , For all the temporal lands which men devout By testament have given to the Church Would they strip from us , being valued thus : "As much as would maintain , to the King's honor , Full fifteen earls and fifteen hundred knights , Six thousand and two hundred good esquires ; And , to relief of lazars and weak age Of indigent faint souls past corporal toil , A hundred almshouses right well supplied ; And to the coffers of the King besides , A thousand pounds by th ' year." Thus runs the bill .

Grace go with you , sir .
A plague upon this howling !
My lord , I have news to tell you .
The duke be here tonight ?
I had a son , Now outlawed from my blood .
Change you color ?
Hastings and Edward's children , Grey and Rivers , Holy King Henry and thy fair son Edward , Vaughan , and all that have miscarried By underhand , corrupted , foul injustice , If that your moody , discontented souls Do through the clouds behold this present hour , Even for revenge mock my destruction. , This is All Souls ' Day , fellow , is it not ?
God grant that some , less noble and less loyal , Nearer in bloody thoughts , and not in blood , Deserve not worse than wretched Clarence did , And yet go current from suspicion .
Know you what Caesar means to do with me ?
Belike his wife , acquainted with his fits , On purpose shut the doors against his way .
They all do hate him As rootedly as I .
Therefore , I beseech your Highness pardon me .
But men may construe things after their fashion , Clean from the purpose of the things themselves .
Today the lords you talked of are beheaded .
Die when thou hast lived .
He threw his eye aside , And mark what object did present itself : Under an old oak , whose boughs were mossed with age And high top bald with dry antiquity , A wretched , ragged man , o'ergrown with hair , Lay sleeping on his back .
What should I speak ?
Tis a blushing , shamefaced spirit that mutinies in a man's bosom .
My heart is sorry for your daughter's death , But , on my honor , she was charged with nothing But what was true and very full of proof .
There's rosemary , that's for remembrance .
It is so too .
Your honor is most welcome .
That is enough to satisfy the senate .
Do 't .
Then away she started To deal with grief alone .
Prince Dauphin , you shall stay with us in Rouen .
O sir , such a life with such a wife were strange !
Now , my dearest Queen , Pray you , stand farther from me .
We would not die in that man's company That fears his fellowship to die with us .
Tis no matter how it be in tune , so it make noise enough .
His daughter is to be brought by you to the supper .
Let me deal in this .
I never did deny it .
Dost thou call me fool , boy ?
And we will mend thy wages .
The gods best know , Oh never was there queen So mightily betrayed !
Here , sir , as foolish as I was before .
I can , Petruchio , help thee to a wife With wealth enough , and young and beauteous , Brought up as best becomes a gentlewoman .
Since I have your good leave to go away , I will make haste .
O , preposterous And frantic outrage , end thy damned spleen , Or let me die , to look on death no more .
Thou sayst his meat was sauced with thy upbraidings .
Triple-turned whore !
As good cause as one would desire .
Let's have no more of this , let's to our affairs. , Forgive us our sins ! , Gentlemen , let's look to our business .
At least two glasses .
How canst thou thus for shame , Titania , Knowing I know thy love to Theseus ?
Good Hermia , do not be so bitter with me .
And we will hear it .
He does hear me , And that he does I weep .
Would you would bear your fortune like a man !
I will presently go learn their day of marriage .
But there's more work .
Treason !
I am qualmish at the smell of leek .
To do thus I learned of thee .
Tell him myself , the mayor , and aldermen , No less importing than our general good , In deep designs , and matters of great moment Are come to have some conference with his grace .
God save you , sir .
What , my gracious lord ?
Content , in faith .
Retire thee , go where thou art billeted .
I do repent me that I put it to you .
I am not well in health , and that is all .
Why , friends , you go to do you know not what .
Farewell .
I am glad thy father's dead , Thy match was mortal to him , and pure grief Shore his old thread in twain .
About a hoop of gold , a paltry ring That she did give me , whose posy was For all the world like cutler's poetry Upon a knife , "Love me and leave me not." What talk you of the posy or the value ?
Surely I do believe your fair cousin is wronged .
I'll carry it to the pile .
Will it eat me ?
There , take you that , sir knave .
For this pains Caesar hath hanged him .
Had you not been their father , these white flakes Did challenge pity of them .
That Herod's head I'll have !
Time is come round , And where I did begin , there shall I end .
Put money enough in your purse .
About the ninth hour , lady .
Sweet saint , for charity , be not so curst .
What watchful cares do interpose themselves Betwixt your eyes and night ?
Ay , very well , my lord .
Call him .
I prithee , put them off .
Nobody come ?
News have I that my Nell is dead i ' th ' spital Of a malady of France , And there my rendezvous is quite cut off .
And , good boy , good night .
I will walk by .
My liege , They are not yet come back .
How ?
Get you therefore hence , Poor miserable wretches , to your death , The taste whereof God of His mercy give You patience to endure , and true repentance Of all your dear offences. , Bear them hence .
How say you now ?
A fox when one has caught her And such a daughter Should sure to the slaughter , If my cap would buy a halter .
How chances it they travel ?
And may you prove , sir , master of your art .
Watch you tonight for the command , I'll lay 't upon you .
Here comes one .
The king my father ? !
Unless you could teach me to forget a banished father , you must not learn me how to remember any extraordinary pleasure .
In what , my dear lord ?
My tongue and soul in this be hypocrites .
This is practice , Gloucester .
God , God forgive us all !
Go take this shape And hither come in 't .
I do never use it .
I never was nor never will be false .
Let's call more help To have them bound again .
What revels are in hand ?
Let me endure your wrath , if 't be not so .
Ha , it may be I go under that title because I am merry .
Well , sir , good night .
They shouted thrice .
This case of that huge spirit now is cold .
Claudio !
I warrant it is to knight you , Captain .
Oh , heaven forgive me !
Ay , when the special thing is well obtained , That is , her love , for that is all in all .
Antonio shall become bound , well .
Most monstrous , oh !
Soldiers , have careful watch .
Yes , I intend so .
What , the chain ?
I , madam ?
Very good .
Why , well .
I might do 't as well i ' th ' dark .
I can not live out of her company .
What does this mean , my lord ?
Sirrah , go see what trumpet 'tis that sounds .
You should ask me what time o ' day .
How now , Captain Macmorris , have you quit the mines ?
It were , my lord , a hard condition for a maid to consign to .
And let us do it with no show of fear , No , with no more than if we heard that England Were busied with a Whitsun morris-dance .
For thy escape would teach me tyranny , To hang clogs on them. , I have done , my lord .
Set it by a while .
Stand thee close , then , under this penthouse , for it drizzles rain , and I will , like a true drunkard , utter all to thee .
Oh !
Love cools , friendship falls off , brothers divide , in cities
Follow me and receive 't .
We shall , my lord .
Truly , and I hold ambition of so airy and light a quality that it is but a shadow's shadow .
Alas , too soon We came aboard .
And who is England's king but great York's heir ?
Well , but to my choice .
I know this , and thus I challenge it .
Catesby .
I do believe it , and I ask your pardon .
Here's a change indeed !
That he was never trained up in arms .
Very foul .
I marvel our mild husband Not met us on the way .
It ripens towards it .
Good night , good Captain Blunt .
I have laid those sheets you bade me on the bed .
You see how simple and how fond I am .
Lord Alexas , sweet Alexas , most anything Alexas , almost most absolute Alexas , where's the soothsayer that you praised so to th' Queen ?
Tis just .
Patience , I say .
No , Lepidus , let him speak .
lie on her ?
Here is the head of that ignoble traitor , The dangerous and unsuspected Hastings .
Tis strange that they should so depart from home , And not send back my messenger .
When comes such another ?
He does .
Good sister , wrong me not nor wrong yourself , To make a bondmaid and a slave of me .
Ay , what else ?
Sir , I must have that diamond from you .
No such jade as you , if me you mean .
Is 't frailty that thus errs ?
That I beheld .
And I am such a tender ass , if my hair do but tickle me , I must scratch .
Let their heads be slickly combed , their blue coats brushed , and their garters of an indifferent knit .
It comes upon me. , Art thou any thing ?
This night methinks is but the daylight sick .
Yonder comes my master , your brother .
If not , to say to thee that I shall die is true , but for thy love , by the Lord , no .
But , tell me , where is princely Richmond now ?
Yours , yours .
That would I , had I kingdoms to give with her .
I heard him say , Brutus and Cassius Are rid like madmen through the gates of Rome .
I must tell you then .
Where is my love ?
Tis much. , Servants , leave me and her alone .
I pray you and beseech you that you will .

This admiration , sir , is much o ' th ' savor Of other your new pranks .
The lady protests too much , methinks .
Let 't be so , good Corporal Nym .
Love is merely a madness and , I tell you , deserves as well a dark house and a whip as madmen do , and the reason why they are not so punished and cured is that the lunacy is so ordinary that the whippers are in love , too .
Ready .
Come , my fair Cordelia .
We are sent To give thee from our royal master thanks , Only to herald thee into his sight , Not pay thee .
Nay , how will you do for a husband ?
Most mighty duke , behold a man much wronged .
And I mine .
Not that I know .
Tell them that you know that Hero loves me .
What heir of York is there alive but we ?
I never knew woman love man so .
What will you give me now For the same handkerchief ?
No boasting like a fool .
But what will you be called ?
In those freckles live their savors .
To a rope's end , sir , and to that end am I returned .
How ?
For I am sure , Though you can guess what temperance should be , You know not what it is .
This is some minx's token , and I must take out the work ?
Dost thou not suspect my years ?
Cassio !
The cause is in my will .
I must stay with the lackeys with the luggage of our camp .
Have I not heard great ordnance in the field , And heaven's artillery thunder in the skies ?
We'll hear him what he says .
I say unto thee , I bid thy master cutout the gown , but I did not bid him cut it to pieces .
May 't please your Majesty to give us leave Freely to render what we have in charge , Or shall we sparingly show you far off The Dauphin's meaning and our embassy ?
God made him and therefore let him pass for a man .
Swear your love .
So should a murderer look , so dead , so grim .
Why , thou silly gentleman !
And the best of me is diligence .
Good e'en , good e'en .
See , see , here comes the man we went to seek .
Believe me for mine honor , and have respect to mine honor that you may believe .
I'll have my bond , and therefore speak no more .
But they'll nor pinch , Fright me with urchin-shows , pitch me i ' th ' mire , Nor lead me like a firebrand in the dark Out of my way , unless he bid 'em .
That I'll try .
I am the son of Marcus Cato , ho !
Who is 't you mean ?
Though we have spent our harvest of this king , We are to reap the harvest of his son .
Be bloody , bold , and resolute .
For I am sure mine nails Are stronger than mine eyes .
The heavens themselves blaze forth the death of princes .
I wonder if the lion be to speak .
What effects , my lord ?
Upon the crown o ' th ' cliff , what thing was that Which parted from you ?
Ay , sir , I thank God .
But what of that ?
Thus the bowl should run , And not unluckily against the bias .
Oh , treason of the blood !
Is he come home yet ?
Even those you were wont to take delight in , the tragedians of the city .
Kill Claudio .
Oh , whither hast thou led me , Egypt ?
Fortune and Antony part here .
No , not for all the world .
Ah , soldier !
O Regan , wilt thou take her by the hand ?
How canst thou cross this marriage ?
He would not take the crown .
I am not gamesome .
It is your music , madam , of the house .
I find here that Don Pedro hath bestowed much honor on a young Florentine called Claudio .
Bid them come near .
Dull thing , I say so .
At once , good night .
Why would you be so fond to overcome The bonny prizer of the humorous duke ?
We , Hermia , like two artificial gods , Have with our needles created both one flower , Both on one sampler , sitting on one cushion , Both warbling of one song , both in one key , As if our hands , our sides , voices , and minds , Had been incorporate .
He'll watch the horologe a double set If drink rock not his cradle .
My Regan counsels well .
Marry , before he fell down , when he perceived the common herd was glad he refused the crown , he plucked me ope his doublet and offered them his throat to cut .
He is a god and knows What is most right .
Let him bless thee too .
Hey , Mountain , hey !
And you are come in very happy time To bear my greeting to the senators And tell them that I will not come today .
Ere I would say I would drown myself for the love of a guinea hen , I would change my humanity with a baboon .
Let me wipe it first .
The sooner , sweet , for you .
How now , Shylock ?
Do you misdoubt This sword and these my wounds ?
An honest tale speeds best being plainly told .
I would not be cured , youth .
But this good comfort bring I to your Highness : The Breton navy is dispersed by tempest .
Tell him my fury shall abate , and I the crowns will take .
Show his eyes and grieve his heart .
That shows thou art unconfirmed .
When Prospero is destroyed .
Do you confess the bond ?
Tranio hits you now .
Perdition catch my soul But I do love thee !
Ay , to a niggardly host and more sparing guest .
I prithee take the cork out of thy mouth , that I may drink thy tidings .
Look !
Let me entreat you .
I will make fast the doors and gild myself With some more ducats , and be with you straight .
What say the augurers ?
Briefly , I dwell by the Capitol .
I do arrest you , sir .
An if he be not fought withal , my lord , Let us not live in France .
And so good morrow to you every one .
Tell us where 'tis , that we may take it thence And bear it to the chapel .
Well , you are gone both ways .
As I stood here below , methought his eyes Were two full moons .
He followed you .
If thou follow him , thou must needs wear my coxcomb. , How now , nuncle ?
Hear you , my lords , We have some haste , Leonato .
I must believe my master ; else , I promise you , I should be arguing still upon that doubt .
But till I come again , No bed shall e'er be guilty of my stay , No rest be interposer 'twixt us twain .
Unbutton here .
Show .
Between who ?
Whisper her ear and tell her I and Ursula Walk in the orchard , and our whole discourse Is all of her .
But now mine eyes , Which I have darted at thee , hurt thee not .
Now , by my troth , if I had been remembered , I could have given my uncle's grace a flout To touch his growth nearer than he touched mine .
Yes , you are .
My Lord , Ay , what's o'clock ?
Nor will do none tomorrow .
Upon her landing , Antony sent to her , Invited her to supper .
Antony Did tell me of you , bade me trust you , but I do not greatly care to be deceived , That have no use for trusting .
That is the sum of all , Leonato. , Signior Claudio and Signior Benedick , my dear friend Leonato hath invited you all .
My wit's diseased .
It is a reeling world indeed , my lord , And I believe will never stand upright Till Richard wear the garland of the realm .
How old art thou ?
I do desire we may be better strangers .
But now , my lord .
tis a lost fear .
What says that fool of Hagar's offspring , ha ?
Very well .
I'll tell thee , friend , I am almost mad myself .
Hear me , you wrangling pirates , that fall out In sharing that which you have pilled from me !
Tis no matter. , Go to the fellow , good Alexas .
And therefore , since I can not prove a lover To entertain these fair well-spoken days , I am determined to prove a villain And hate the idle pleasures of these days .
Oh , I am spoiled , undone by villains !
Whither away ?
My lord , I claim the gift , my due by promise , For which your honor and your faith is pawned , Th ' earldom of Hereford and the movables Which you promised I shall possess .
Thus have I , Wall , my part discharged so .
The king enacts more wonders than a man , Daring an opposite to every danger .
Run one before And let the Queen know of our gests .
Though to have her and death were both one thing .
For gazing on your beams , fair sun , being by .
Fair youth , I would I could make thee believe I love .
Be not afraid .
We must be married , or we must live in bawdry. , Farewell , good Master Oliver , not 'T is no matter .
Thy life hath had some smatch of honor in it .
Mark Antony , Pardon me , Caius Cassius .
Who talks of my nation ?
I think I had .
It harrows me with fear and wonder .
Ay , millstones , as he lessoned us to weep .
That love i begged for you he begged of me .
This done , he took the bride about the neck And kissed her lips with such a clamorous smack That at the parting all the church did echo .
Do not talk to me , Emilia .
He's as good at anything and yet a fool .
Speak .
To show an unfelt sorrow is an office Which the false man does easy .
Arise , and say how thou camest here .
Yea , an 'twere a thousand pound more than 'tis , for I hear as good exclamation on your Worship as of any man in the city , and though I be but a poor man , I am glad to hear it .
Here .
But , oh , vain boast !
If he come not , then the play is marred .
So please you , he is here at the door and importunes access to you .
Therefore , Lord Constable , haste on Montjoy And let him say to England that we send To know what willing ransom he will give .
Tear him to pieces .
It does , my boy .
Let's to billiards .
Ingratitude , thou marble-hearted fiend , More hideous when thou show'st thee in a child Than the sea monster .
So 'tis to thee .
Pompey Thrives in our idleness .
I have told him , Lepidus was grown too cruel , That he his high authority abused And did deserve his change .
An if they live , I hope I need not fear .
Not I but my affairs have made you wait .
Come , be a man .
No , I will not .
I'll humbly signify what in his name , That magical word of war , we have effected : How with his banners and his well-paid ranks The ne'er-yet-beaten horse of Parthia We have jaded out o' th' field .
Where hast thou been , my heart ?
Dispatch .
Fortune pursue thee !
In verity you did. , My bones bear witness , That since have felt the vigour of his rage .
Graces will appear , and there's an end .
Here , my good lord .
How smooth and even they do bear themselves , As if allegiance in their bosoms sat Crowned with faith and constant loyalty .
Proceed , Solinus , to procure my fall , And by the doom of death end woes and all .
Let me have open means to come to them , And soon I'll rid you from the fear of them .
If he were dead , you'd weep for him .
In Venice they do let God see the pranks They dare not show their husbands .
I alone will go .
Proof enough to misuse the Prince , to vex Claudio , to undo Hero , and kill Leonato .
I pray you , what thinks he of our estate ?
How now ?
If a Christian do not play the knave and get thee , I am much deceived .
Wisdom and goodness to the vile seem vile .
My father's loss , the weakness which I feel , The wrack of all my friends , nor this man's threats , To whom I am subdued , are but light to me , Might I but through my prison once a day Behold this maid .
I have no words .
A bitter fool .
Come .
Speak to us .
Ay , sir , the sergeant of the band ; he that brings any man to answer it that breaks his band ; one that thinks a man always going to bed and says "God give you good rest." Well , sir , there rest in your foolery .
Some five or six and thirty of his knights , Hot questrists after him , met him at gate , Who with some other of the lord's dependants Are gone with him towards Dover , where they boast To have well-armed friends .
One , Kate , that you must kiss and be acquainted with. , Where are my slippers ?
I was told that by one that knows him better than you .
Come .
What was 't That moved pale Cassius to conspire ?
Seal then , and all is done. , Eros ! , I come , my Queen. , Eros ! , Stay for me .
Hast thou found my daughter ?
Well , my good lord , I have informed them so .
My worthy Cawdor !
How came we ashore ?
Oh , he's returned , and as pleasant as ever he was .
Prithee , peace .
Thy eyes are almost set in thy head .
Why , wherefore ask you this ?
You have done that you should be sorry for .
Didst thou not hear their shouts ?
He is too disputable for my company .
O spite of spites !
Oh , dispatch me !
Of all the days i ' the year , I came to 't that day that our last King Hamlet overcame Fortinbras .
Alack , sir , you can not see your way .
You shall be king .
Alack , for mercy !
Tis cowardly and womanish .
Oh , it is monstrous , monstrous .
Can you smell him out by that ?
Now near enough .
What , will you not suffer me ?
And we understand him well , How he comes o'er us with our wilder days , Not measuring what use we made of them .
For better might we Have loved without this mean , if on both parts This be not cherished .
Hath she forgot already that brave prince , Edward , her lord , whom I some three months since Stabbed in my angry mood at Tewkesbury ?
At every house I'll call .
I had rather hear my dog bark at a crow than a man swear he loves me .
Twice then the trumpets sounded , And there I left him tranced .
But art thou not drowned , Stephano ?
Music such as charmeth sleep !
By two o'clock I will be with thee again .
Zounds , hold your peace .
Now show the wound mine eye hath made in thee .
I pause for a reply .
Sir , I say to you we are none .
What trumpet is that same ?
Then comes the time , who lives to see 't , That going shall be used with feet .
Did you know him ?
So I charmed their ears That , calflike , they my lowing followed through Toothed briers , sharp furzes , pricking gorse , and thorns , Which entered their frail shins .
Jove shield thee well for this !
How is 't , Laertes ?
I will unto Venice To buy apparel 'gainst the wedding day .
Pray you lead on .
If you deny them , all the land will rue it .
Avoid what is to come .
Speak .
Self-harming jealousy , fie , beat it hence .
I will be satisfied .
I will but spend a word here in the house And go with you .
Go and tell them so .
To thee , that hast nor honesty nor grace .
We are three of them .
You , you , sirrah , where's my daughter ?
Why , Antony .
Should not upbraid our course .
Look , here comes the duke .
Downy windows , close ,
Why , then Othello and Desdemona return again to Venice .
Give me your hand first .
And we did think it writ down in our duty To let you know of it .
What news , what news in this our tott'ring state ?
No , I pray thee speak in sober judgment .
The money that you owe me for the chain .
Haply when I shall wed That lord whose hand must take my plight shall carry Half my love with him , half my care and duty .
Nay , forward , old man .
Tis a shrewd doubt , though it be but a dream .
The foul fiend bites my back .
Farewell , and if my fortune be not crost , I have a father , you a daughter , lost .
Let Rome be thus informed .
Pray you , hasten Your generals after .
Moonshine and Lion are left to bury the dead .
O Banquo , Banquo , Our royal master's murdered !
The cry is still "They come ! " Our castle's strength Will laugh a siege to scorn .
We'll revenge his death .
A match !
Unwilling , I agreed .
Wilt thou , O God , fly from such gentle lambs And throw them in the entrails of the wolf ?
Behold it stained With his most noble blood .
How now , Horatio ?
And I in all unwillingness will go .
Good fortune , worthy soldier , and farewell .
What sum owes he the Jew ?
Say to me whose fortunes shall rise higher , Caesar's or mine ?
O Tranio , till I found it to be true , I never thought it possible or likely .
God grant him health .
Well , let them rest. , Come hither , Catesby .
All is the fear and nothing is the love , As little is the wisdom , where the flight So runs against all reason .
But 'tis gone .
And false .
They would be better if well followed .
Go then and muster men , but leave behind Your son George Stanley .
Prithee , nuncle , be contented .
I take some joy to say you are because I would be talking of her .
Convey her to my tent .
Madam , sleeps still .
You taught me language , and my profit on 't Is I know how to curse .
The oats have eaten the horses .
Of that there's none , or little .
Do , good William .
Strike alarum , drums !
Good my lord .
Piece out our imperfections with your thoughts .
My lord , the army of great Buckingham , Out on you , owls !
Stop her there !
E'en so .
Do so .
Why did you bring these daggers from the place ?
Nor would we deign him burial of his men Till he disbursed at Saint Colme's Inch Ten thousand dollars to our general use .
Till I shall see you in your soldiers' dress , Which will become you both , farewell .
If it please His Majesty , 'tis the breathing time of day with me .
Why then , thus it is : You must prepare your bosom for his knife .
Well , as time shall try .
She's full of most blessed condition .
Ay , and brought off the field .
A match !
Then slip I from her bum , down topples she , And "Tailor ! " cries , and falls into a cough , And then the whole quire hold their hips and laugh , And waxen in their mirth , and neeze , and swear A merrier hour was never wasted there .
Oh , they take the part of a better wrestler than myself .
Thou livest .
This can not be , By no assay of reason .
Villainous whore !
Then let them use us well , else let them know , The ills we do , their ills instruct us so .
What , did they never whisper ?
Here's a spirit .
Hear you the news abroad ?
Better I were distract , So should my thoughts be severed from my griefs , And woes by wrong imaginations lose The knowledge of themselves .
You are passing welcome , And so I pray you all to think yourselves .
Perchance , Iago , I will ne'er go home .
You have her father's love , Demetrius .
Let four captains Bear Hamlet like a soldier to the stage , For he was likely , had he been put on , To have proved most royally .
Indeed , my lord , you made me believe so .
Find you out a bed , For I upon this bank will rest my head .
Why , so didst thou .
Alas , and woe !
I will be more jealous of thee than a Barbary cock- pigeon over his hen , more clamorous than a parrot against rain , more newfangled than an ape , more giddy in my desires than a monkey .
Therefore the sadness is without limit .
He hath slept long .
You know me well , and herein spend but time To wind about my love with circumstance .
Justice , most sacred duke , against the Abbess .
Fly , masters !
Where's my fool , ho ?
Go armed .
He's friends with Caesar , In state of health , thou say'st , and , thou say'st , free .
Amen , say we .
I will not go today , and ere I do It shall be what o'clock I say it is .
O masters , if I were disposed to stir Your hearts and minds to mutiny and rage , I should do Brutus wrong , and Cassius wrong , Who , you all know , are honorable men .
Nay , faith , I'll see the church a ' your back , and then come back to my master's as soon as I can .
Madam , I wish it may .
No more light answers .
O , one too much by thee !
Sweet mistress , what your name is else I know not , Nor by what wonder you do hit of mine , ,
Thou shouldst be honest .
In the street I met him , And in his company that gentleman .
When 's god's asleep , he'll rob his bottle .
There , my blessing with thee .
One Hero died defiled , but I do live , And surely as I live , I am a maid .
O , would to God that the inclusive verge Of golden metal that must round my brow Were red-hot steel to sear me to the brains !
What should I do ?
Is he arrayed ?
No , let me know , And knowing what I am , I know what she shall be .
The one I'll stay , the other stayeth me .
Thou dost mean something .
Bestow it at your pleasure , and believe Caesar's no merchant , to make prize with you Of things that merchants sold .
I will not swear these are my hands .
He'll make a proper man .
What mean you , sir ?
Twere damnation To think so base a thought .
But is there any else longs to see this broken music in his sides ?
Sunday comes apace .
And shall , or some of us will smart for it .
I know , " quoth he , "no house , no wife , no mistress." So that my errand , due unto my tongue , I thank him , I bare home upon my shoulders , For , in conclusion , he did beat me there .
The king has killed his heart .
Nay , their endeavor keeps in the wonted pace .
Here comes my man .
All's well .
Name the day of marriage , and God give thee joy .
Sir , March is wasted fifteen days .
Kneel to the duke before he pass the abbey .
Good Corporal Nym , show thy valor and put up your sword .
A good wench , give it me .
And now you know my meaning .
Let me , if not by birth , have lands by wit .
I called thee then "vain flourish of my fortune." I called thee then poor shadow , "painted queen , " The presentation of but what I was , The flattering index of a direful pageant , One heaved a-high , to be hurled down below , A mother only mocked with two fair babes , A dream of what thou wast , a garish flag To be the aim of every dangerous shot , A sign of dignity , a breath , a bubble , A queen in jest , only to fill the scene .
But then the mind much sufferance doth o'erskip When grief hath mates and bearing fellowship .
Was the hope drunk Wherein you dressed yourself ?
Be as ourself in Denmark. , Madam , come .
Come thee on .
I know not if 't be true , But I , for mere suspicion in that kind , Will do as if for surety .
I was contracted to them both .
Thus ornament is but the guiled shore To a most dangerous sea , the beauteous scarf Veiling an Indian beauty , in a word , The seeming truth which cunning times put on To entrap the wisest .
Her father's brother Would be her lord ?
Never at quiet .
Oh , banish me , my lord , but kill me not !
What , all so soon asleep ?
He's almost slain , and Roderigo dead .
A piece of work that will make sick men whole .
It is a good divine that follows his own instructions .
No , my good lord .
Away with the dotard !
I did say so When first I raised the tempest .
Double , double toil and trouble , Fire burn and cauldron bubble .
Do then , but I'll not hear .
It is gone .
Be of good cheer , youth .
Then comes my fit again .
We'll go to supper i ' th ' morning .
Well , gentlemen , I am thus resolved : On Sunday next , you know My daughter Katherina is to be married .
Yea , dost thou jeer and flout me in the teeth ?
Before the days of change , still is it so .
Hark , come hither , Tyrrel .
I think thou dost .
Descend .
Take hence this jack and whip him .
Signior Brabantio , ho !
Canst thou remember A time before we came unto this cell ?
I will have such revenges on you both That all the world shall , I will do such things , What they are yet I know not , but they shall be The terrors of the earth .
There are things in this comedy of Pyramus and Thisbe that will never please .
I was born to speak all mirth and no matter .
Goodly Lord , what a wit-snapper are you !
How much unlike art thou Mark Antony !
Monster , I will kill this man .
But if it were , doubt not her care should be To comb your noddle with a three-legged stool And paint your face and use you like a fool .
Draw , you rascal !
A good soft pillow for that good white head Were better than a churlish turf of France .
I am sure you are not Launcelot , my boy .
And seemed I ever otherwise to you ?
No .
Thou'ld'st have , great Glamis , That which cries , "Thus thou must do , " if thou have it , And that which rather thou dost fear to do , Than wishest should be undone .
Know we this face or no ?
A good sharp fellow .
The throng that follows Caesar at the heels , Of senators , of praetors , common suitors , Will crowd a feeble man almost to death .
Little" again ?
Not yet .
And he's gone .
She doth stray about By holy crosses , where she kneels and prays For happy wedlock hours .
For if the sun breed maggots in a dead dog , being a good kissing carrion , Have you a daughter ?
And so , his knell is knolled .
Come , let us to the banquet .
I'll leave you , lady .
So will I turn her virtue into pitch And out of her own goodness make the net That shall enmesh them all .
Is your Englishman so expert in his drinking ?
Not honestly , my lord , but so covertly that no dishonesty shall appear in me .
You do me wrong to take me out o ' th ' grave .
I have a daughter , sir , called Katherina .
Did you ?
Not for thy fairy kingdom. , Fairies , away !
Can any of your neighbors tell , Kate ?
Thus was I , sleeping , by a brother's hand Of life , of crown , of queen at once dispatched , Cut off even in the blossoms of my sin ,
What , not a word ?
Amen .
Most rightful judge !
When all's done , You look but on a stool .
You are i ' the right , sir , 'tis for my mistress .
Go in with me .
What , are you mad ?
Or stole it , rather .
What say you to a neat's foot ?
See it done And feast the army .
Perhaps I will return immediately .
Away , go away !
And what said Surrey then ?
Were you made the messenger ?
Be thy mouth or black or white , Do-de , de-de .
I beseech you .
We are men , my liege .
Therefore heaven nature charged That one body should be filled With all graces wide-enlarged .
What did thy song bode , lady ?
What a wretched and peevish fellow is this king of England to mope with his fat-brained followers so far out of his knowledge .
The sea , with such a storm as his bare head In hell-black night endured , would have buoyed up , And quenched the stelled fires .
Dined at home" ?
Oh , then , what graces in my love do dwell , That he hath turned a heaven unto a hell !
Look in the calendar and bring me word .
Ay , sir .
Methought I lay Worse than the mutines in the bilboes .
But fish not with this melancholy bait For this fool gudgeon , this opinion. , Come , good Lorenzo. , Fare ye well awhile .
Thou still hast been the father of good news .
There needs no ghost , my lord , come from the grave To tell us this .
Things must be as they may .
Suffolk first died , and York , all haggled over , Comes to him where in gore he lay insteeped And takes him by the beard , kisses the gashes That bloodily did yawn upon his face .
Our Italy Shines o'er with civil swords .
My most dear lord !
Are his wits safe ?
Nay , I bear it on my shoulders as a beggar wont her brat , and I think when he hath lamed me , I shall beg with it from door to door .
In a false quarrel there is no true valor .
And where's Cordelia ? , Seest thou this object , Kent ?
Ay , but not frighted me .
I'll join with black despair against my soul And to myself become an enemy .
The spring , the summer , The childing autumn , angry winter change Their wonted liveries , and the mazed world , By their increase , now knows not which is which .
Not so , my lord .
In good time , sir , what's that ?
I'll tell you in your ear .
Fly And make your peace with Caesar .
You shall have ransom .
Wouldst thou do such a deed for all the world ?
Here .
It is Brabantio .
Give me a cup of wine .
Company is coming here .
Where is your servant Caius ?
What , of death too , That rids our dogs of languish ?
Pluck out his eyes .
And if thou prate of mountains let them throw Millions of acres on us , till our ground , Singeing his pate against the burning zone , Make Ossa like a wart !
Ill rest betide the chamber where thou liest !
Bear me , good friends , where Cleopatra bides .
What a strange drowsiness possesses them !
Look , how she rubs her hands .
Why , no .
Othello , leave some officer behind And he shall our commission bring to you , And such things else of quality and respect As doth import you .
He says so .
We will persuade him , be it possible , To put on better ere he go to church .
To what effect ?
So do all thoughts .
No , but she let it drop by negligence And , to th ' advantage , I being here , took 't up .
An if you plead as well for them As I can say "nay" to thee for myself , No doubt we bring it to a happy issue .
A most wicked Sir Oliver , Audrey , a most vile Martext .
I cross me for a sinner .
He forbids it , Being free from vainness and self-glorious pride , Giving full trophy , signal , and ostent Quite from himself , to God .
No , not till a hot January .
I oft delivered from his forfeitures Many that have at times made moan to me .
The best news is that we have safely found Our king and company .
I'm out of patience .
We are arrant knaves , all .
So the maid that stood in the way for my wish shall show me the way to my will .
Well , heaven's above all , and there be souls must be saved , and there be souls must not be saved .
First , as you know , my house within the city Is richly furnished with plate and gold , Basins and ewers to lave her dainty hands ; My hangings all of Tyrian tapestry , In ivory coffers I have stuffed my crowns , In cypress chests my arras counterpoints , Costly apparel , tents , and canopies , Fine linen , Turkey cushions bossed with pearl , Valance of Venice gold in needlework , Pewter and brass , and all things that belong To house or housekeeping .
Then say they were not slain .
O happy horse , to bear the weight of Antony !
Here lies the east .
It is my promise , And they expect it from me .
Prithee , do not turn me about .
Words , words , words .
Edmund is dead , my lord .
Good gentlemen , look fresh and merrily .
I loved him , friend , No father his son dearer .
Tempt him not so too far .
What , wilt thou hear some music , my sweet love ?
And to deal plainly I fear I am not in my perfect mind .
In the meantime I will draw a bill of properties such as our play wants .
Nay , indeed if you had your eyes , you might fail of the knowing me .

In some bush ?
My lord is dead .
All hail , Macbeth !
And every object that might make me fear Misfortune to my ventures out of doubt Would make me sad .

Go , by this token .
Here's more news .
Come , sir , I am for you .

If it please you .

Whether this be Or be not , I'll not swear .
Help , angels .

One cried , "God bless us ! " and "Amen" the other , As they had seen me with these hangman's hands .

What is he that shall buy his flock and pasture ?
This is a slight , unmeritable man , Meet to be sent on errands .
I would he had boarded me .
Who's his lieutenant , hear you ?
Naught's had , all's spent , Where our desire is got without content .

Ay , sir .
Strike his wife ?
If it prove lawful prize , he's made for ever .
Give me a taper , call up all my people !
Look you who comes here , a young man and an old in solemn talk .

Where the devil should he learn our language ?

But I'll catch thine eyes , Though they had wings .

Searching the window for a flint , I found This paper , thus sealed up , and I am sure It did not lie there when I went to bed .

Sir , have pity , I'll be his surety .
There , take it ; and much thanks for my good cheer .
Right joyous are we to behold your face , Most worthy brother England .
Thou sayest his sports were hinderd by thy brawls .
And then he offered it the third time .

Look behind you , my lord .
Is there more toil ?
Whiles I threat , he lives .
Asses are made to bear , and so are you .

Well , we shall sift him. , Welcome , my good friends !
We are for you .
Wouldst thou aught with me ?
Draw that thy honest sword , which thou hast worn Most useful for thy country .
No , uncle , I'll none .
Fetch thy master home .
Prithee , my king , be quiet .
Hast thou forgot The foul witch Sycorax , who with age and envy Was grown into a hoop ?

Now a little fire in a wild field were like an old lecher's heart , a small spark , all the rest on 's body cold .
What didst not like ?
The devil himself could not pronounce a title More hateful to mine ear .
Oh , how he loves Caesar !

Or sleep I now and think I hear all this ?
They are winged .
Octavia is of a holy , cold , and still conversation .
What , and my old Venetian friend Salerio ?
Then , lest he may , prevent .

I do not like thy look , I promise thee .
Keep your word , Phoebe , that you'll marry me Or else , refusing me , to wed this shepherd .
O , but one word .

The question of Cordelia and her father Requires a fitter place .
For what offence ?
Nay , but this dotage of our general's O'erflows the measure .

But i ' faith , I should have been a woman by right .

I am mightily abused .
The Prince of Arragon hath ta'en his oath And comes to his election presently .

I have a file Of all the gentry .
O illegitimate construction !
O dear Ophelia , I am ill at these numbers .
She rendered life , Thy name so buried in her .
I have done .
Here , Peter Quince .
Brother , I advise you to the best .
They shall be married tomorrow , and I will bid the duke to the nuptial .
Though it be honest , it is never good To bring bad news .
I can not hope Caesar and Antony shall well greet together .
Provoke not battle Till we have done at sea .
What mean'st thou by that ?
What , thou meanest an officer ?
And pity to the general wrong of Rome , As fire drives out fire , so pity pity , Hath done this deed on Caesar .
Tis marvel , but that you are but newly come , You might have heard it else proclaimed about .
Why , here's no crab , and therefore look not sour .
Thou hast harped my fear aright .
What do you here alone ?
If that you were the good Sir Rowland's son , As you have whispered faithfully you were , And as mine eye doth his effigies witness Most truly limned and living in your face , Be truly welcome hither .
Let us be conjunctive in our revenge against him .

All schooldays ' friendship , childhood innocence ?
Come away , away .
Therefore another prologue must tell he is not a lion .

Poor men alone ?
The Prince and Claudio promised by this hour To visit me. , You know your office , brother .

Here's too much "out upon thee ! " I pray thee , let me in .
The gold I gave to Dromio is laid up Safe at the Centaur , and the heedful slave Is wandered forth , in care to seek me out .
Well mayst thou woo , and happy be thy speed .
Leave me , I pray , a little .
Oh , wonder !
Come , some music !

Nothing ?
You saw they speak us fair , give us gold .
A golden mind stoops not to shows of dross .

Who ?

What it should be , More than his father's death , that thus hath put him So much from th ' understanding of himself , I can not dream of .
My good lord .
What's your gracious pleasure ?
Puppet" ?
There I have another bad match ! , a bankrupt , a prodigal who dare scarce show his head on the Rialto , a beggar that was used to come so smug upon the mart .
Then like a Roman bear the truth I tell .
Adieu .
Who's there ?
Is 't so , indeed .
Why do we wrap the gentleman in our more rawer breath ?
How hast thou offended ?
My daughter !
Follow him , friends .
The moon shines bright .
So the gods preserve thee !
Why so earnestly seek you to put up that letter ?
Marry , sir , be better employed , and be naught awhile .
Who comes so fast in silence of the night ?
Yes , in truth it is , sir .
Cry "holla" to thy tongue , I prithee .
I pray you tell your brother how well I counterfeited .
Get horses for your mistress .

This is not yet an Alexandrian feast .
Ay , but their sense is shut .
And ere I take this charm from of her sight , As I can take it with another herb , I'll make her render up her page to me .
The trumpery in my house , go bring it hither For stale to catch these thieves .
Amen to that , sweet powers !
The four strangers seek for you , madam , to take their leave .
Double , double toil and trouble , Fire burn , and cauldron bubble .
There could I have him now , and there , and there again , and there .
A night is but small breath and little pause To answer matters of this consequence .
Were not my doors locked up and I shut out ?
This is some fellow , Who , having been praised for bluntness , doth affect A saucy roughness and constrains the garb Quite from his nature .
Why , good sir ?
An honest mind and plain , he must speak truth .
Take thy fair hour , Laertes .
I was enforced to send it after him .
There I deny my land service .
I believe drink gave thee the lie last night .
Let me have surgeons .
You , cousin .
I have a beard coming .
You were kneeled to and importuned otherwise By all of us , and the fair soul herself Weighed between loathness and obedience , at Which end o ' th ' beam should bow .
I see a woman may be made a fool If she had not a spirit to resist .
What , wouldst thou have a serpent sting thee twice ?
It is now high suppertime , and the night grows to waste .
Do not believe That , from the sense of all civility , I thus would play and trifle with your reverence .
Most like .
How fares our cousin , noble Lord of York ?
Besides , I have some business in the town .
If by your art , my dearest father , you have Put the wild waters in this roar , allay them .

Sir , this is the matter , I beseech you , remember , Nay , good my lord , for mine ease , in good faith .
Or to be naked with her friend in bed An hour or more , not meaning any harm ?
The wildest hath not such a heart as you .
Ah keeper , keeper , I have done those things , That now give evidence against my soul , For Edward's sake , and see how he requites me. , O God , if my deep prayers can not appease thee , But thou wilt be avenged on my misdeeds , Yet execute thy wrath in me alone !
Lest it make you choleric and purchase me another dry basting .
But , Othello , speak .
Come on , gentle my lord , Sleek o'er your rugged looks .
Why , then , 'tis none to you , for there is nothing either good or bad , but thinking makes it so .
Are they returned ?
For in all the play There is not one word apt , one player fitted .
How now ?
Peace , ho !
Why should I not ?
We must be patient , but I can not choose but weep , to think they should lay him i ' th ' cold ground .
Give me the cups .
The labor we delight in physics pain .
An thou hadst been set i ' th ' stocks for that question , thou'dst well deserved it .
What handkerchief ?
Good Father , how foolish are our minds !
I have almost slipped the hour .
Good morrow , General .
Tis good .
I am to pray you not to strain my speech To grosser issues nor to larger reach Than to suspicion .
Do you like me , Kate ?
And , sir , tonight I do entreat that we may sup together .
It is impossible .
Returned so soon ?
We'll go along together , And ere we have thy youthful wages spent , We'll light upon some settled low content .
I would not have given it for a wilderness of monkeys .
Most noble Caesar !
Expound unto me , boy .
I am sick and sullen .
I shall break The cause of our expedience to the Queen And get her leave to part .

Now , by the holy mother of our Lord , The citizens are mum , say not a word .
I'll hold my mind were she an Ethiope .
Good night .
Have with you .

Robin Starveling , you must play Thisbe's mother. , Tom Snout , the tinker ?
He is , my lord , and safe in Leicester town , Whither , if it please you , we may now withdraw us .
Peace yet again .
Go after .

Your lips will feel them the sooner .
What villain touched his body , that did stab , And not for justice ?
I say thou hast belied mine innocent child .
Not I .
Welcome , good Cambio .

Yes , bring me word , boy , if thy lord look well , For he went sickly forth .
Tis true , my brother's daughter's Queen of Tunis , So is she heir of Naples , 'twixt which regions There is some space .
Bloody constraint , for if you hide the crown Even in your hearts , there will he rake for it .
This , Cinna .
Who , I , my lord ?
But there where I have garnered up my heart , Where either I must live or bear no life , The fountain from the which my current runs Or else dries up , to be discarded thence !
Tis strange .
Your worship speaks like a most thankful and reverent youth , and I praise God for you .
Transform me , then , and to your power I'll yield .
Murellus and Flavius , for pulling scarfs off Caesar's images , are put to silence .
So it appears by that I have to say .
Marry , sir , with needle and thread .
I once writ a sonnet in his praise and began thus : "Wonder of nature , " I have heard a sonnet begin so to one's mistress .
Yea , marry , that's the eftest way. , Let the watch come forth .
If it be love indeed , tell me how much .
Go carry them and smear The sleepy grooms with blood .
Alas , poor Harry of England !
Peace be with Burgundy .
But soft !
Unkindness may do much , And his unkindness may defeat my life , But never taint my love .
That's certain , if the devil may be her judge .
Adieu , good neighbor .
You have a daughter called Elizabeth , Virtuous and fair , royal and gracious .
Throw physic to the dogs ; I'll none of it .
It is here , Hamlet .
She is cunning past man's thought .
I think the world's asleep .
And earthly power doth then show likest God's When mercy seasons justice .
This I made good to you In our last conference , passed in probation with you , How you were borne in hand , how crossed , the instruments , Who wrought with them , and all things else that might To half a soul and to a notion crazed Say , "Thus did Banquo." You made it known to us .
By my sword , Beatrice , thou lovest me .
Lord , " quoth he ?
I remember the story .
And doubt not , sir , but she will well excuse Why at this time the doors are made against you .
Here let them lie Till famine and the ague eat them up .
Take thy forfeiture .
Sweet soul , let's in , and there expect their coming .
But stop my house's ears , I mean my casements , Let not the sound of shallow foppery enter My sober house .
Thy false uncle , Dost thou attend me ?
Tender yourself more dearly , Or , not to crack the wind of the poor phrase , Running it thus , you'll tender me a fool .
He that commends me to mine own content Commends me to the thing I can not get .
It droppeth as the gentle rain from heaven Upon the place beneath .
Dead .
If she should make tender of her love , 'tis very possible he'll scorn it , for the man , as you know all , hath a contemptible spirit .
A grievous fault. , Say , woman , didst thou so ?
We'll lead you thither .
Good night to you .
I have a daughter , have while she is mine , Who in her duty and obedience , mark , Hath given me this .
So do our vulgar drench their peasant limbs In blood of princes , and the wounded steeds Fret fetlock deep in gore , and with wild rage Yerk out their armed heels at their dead masters , Killing them twice .
Brother of Gloucester , you mistake the matter .
We had much more monstrous matter of feast , which worthily deserved noting .
Let him look to his bond .
They do offend our sight .
So say I. Methinks you are sadder .
I think he will carry this island home in his pocket and give it his son for an apple .
You look not well , Signor Antonio .
Wilt thou destroy him then ?
A drum , a drum !
Shall we be sundered ?
Treason and murder ever kept together As two yoke-devils sworn to either's purpose , Working so grossly in a natural cause That admiration did not whoop at them .
Beggar that I am , I am even poor in thanks ; but I thank you , and sure , dear friends , my thanks are too dear a halfpenny .
We all expect a gentle answer , Jew .
Hear me with patience .
We have done our course .
Where lies he ?
There is but one hope in it that can do you any good , and that is but a kind of bastard hope neither .
I am more an antique Roman than a Dane .
I know no touch of it , my lord .
Now , Cinna. , Now , Metellus. , What , Trebonius , I have an hour's talk in store for you .
The odds is gone , And there is nothing left remarkable Beneath the visiting moon .
What makes him here ?
Go , go , dispatch .
Hear me , for I will speak .
Why came not the slave back to me when I called him .
Have you a soul or sense ?
Three months from twelve , then .
Lady , amen .
Hark , hark !
Yet I insisted ; yet you answered not , But with an angry wafture of your hand Gave sign for me to leave you .
He is returned .
Of what , lady ?
I love her ten times more than e'er I did .
Stands Scotland where it did ?
Made I him king for this ?
My salad days , When I was green in judgment , cold in blood , To say as I said then .
I have an humor to knock you indifferently well .
I could tell you more news too .
Where have I been ?
But that my Lady Beatrice should know me , and not know me !
Would I might never O'ertake pursued success , but I do feel , By the rebound of yours , a grief that smites My very heart at root .
What art thou ?
Besides , the knave is handsome , young , and hath all those requisites in him that folly and green minds look after .
I say a husband .
Before my body I throw my warlike shield .
Rapier and dagger .
Bind fast his corky arms .
Away , away , be gone .
That which is now a horse , even with a thought The rack dislimns and makes it indistinct As water is in water .
That "fair" again unsay .
But , as I can learn , He hearkens after prophecies and dreams , And from the crossrow plucks the letter And says a wizard told him that by "G" His issue disinherited should be .
Meet me and Gratiano At Gratiano's lodging some hour hence .
Take not her part .
The will , the will !
My lord , from head to foot .
But fare you well .
Lay breath so bitter on your bitter foe .
At five o'clock I shall receive the money for the same .
You love me not .
There are no faces truer than those that are so washed .
Tonight I take my leave .
I will , sir .
Hark !
There were none fine but Adam , Rafe , and Gregory .
Here , sir !
Upon the stroke of four .
I am so .
Are you wise ?
What should that bode ?
Do , with like timorous accent and dire yell As when , by night and negligence , the fire Is spied in populous cities .
My brother's love , the devil , and my rage .
Lead me from hence .
O , in the duke of Gloucester's purse .
But if I give my wife a handkerchief , What then ?
Against all rules of nature , and must be driven To find out practices of cunning hell Why this should be .
His nurse ?
To that end , As matching to his youth and vanity , I did present him with the Paris balls .
What's the news with thee ?
Soundly , my lord .
But what talk I of this ?
There is a man haunts the forest that abuses our young plants with carving "Rosalind" on their barks , hangs odes upon hawthorns and elegies on brambles , all , forsooth , deifying the name of Rosalind .
Machinations , hollowness , treachery , and all ruinous disorders follow us disquietly to our graves .
We wait upon your Grace .
Throw this slave Upon the dunghill. , Regan , I bleed apace .
His lecture will be done ere you have tuned .
Have you not read , Roderigo , Of some such thing ?
And what art thou that dar'st Appear thus to us ?
Tis now struck twelve .
Our wars are done , the Turks are drowned .
Out of my sight !
Hold , for your lives !
Reproach and everlasting shame Sits mocking in our plumes .
Why , Gloucester , Gloucester , I'd speak with the Duke of Cornwall and his wife .
Call thyself "sister , " sweet , for I am thee .
The weight of this sad time we must obey .
If you poison us , do we not die ?
Bid me tear the bond .
If I myself , there is no hour so fit As Caesar's death's hour , nor no instrument Of half that worth as those your swords , made rich With the most noble blood of all this world .
Why , now , as fast as she can marry us .
Grandam , his nurse .
No , he's a yeoman that has a gentleman to his son , for he's a mad yeoman that sees his son a gentleman before him .
The violet smells to him as it doth to me .
I have fair meanings , sir .
That's good .
I will not sleep , Hortensio , till I see her , And therefore let me be thus bold with you To give you over at this first encounter , Unless you will accompany me thither .
And Cassio killed !
What would you , Desdemona ?
He waxes desperate with imagination .
But , like the owner of a foul disease , To keep it from divulging , let it feed Even on the pith of life .
Ha !
Why , what wouldst thou do there before I go ?
My lord ?
But other of your insolent retinue Do hourly carp and quarrel , breaking forth In rank and not-to-be-endured riots .
Why then , thou hast it .
That's as much as to say , the sweet youth's in love .
What , ho , Brabantio !
I do beseech you , take it not amiss ; I can not , nor I will not , yield to you .
My father's spirit in arms .
If it will not be , I'll leave you .
Where's the Master ?
Men should be what they seem , Or those that be not , would they might seem none !
Haste thee for thy life .
Hold , hold , my heart , And you , my sinews , grow not instant old , But bear me stiffly up .
Oh , heaven forgive us !
For learn this , Silius : Better to leave undone than by our deed Acquire too high a fame when him we serve's away .
Why , to keep one's eyes of either side 's nose , that what a man can not smell out , he may spy into .
Stop in your wind , sir .
Ay , in the temple , in the town , the field You do me mischief .
Thus hath the candle singed the moth .
Now I arise .
Ay , my liege , so please you give us leave .
Where runn'st thou so fast ?
Then is Caesar and he forever knit together .
Yea , or to paint himself ?
What malice was between you ?
Marry , God forbid !
Thus when I shun Scylla your father , I fall into Charybdis your mother .
Very well .
I am content , so the maiden cities you talk of may wait on her .
It shall not need .
He has brave utensils , for so he calls them , Which when he has a house , he'll deck withal .
You see an ass head of your own , do you ?
Come on .
Lucentio !
And to that end we wished your Lordship here T ' avoid the censures of the carping world .
I know him not .
But this rough magic I here abjure , and when I have required Some heavenly music , which even now I do , To work mine end upon their senses that This airy charm is for , I'll break my staff , Bury it certain fathoms in the earth , And deeper than did ever plummet sound I'll drown my book .
Then you will bring the chain to her yourself .
Never , my lord .
The castle's gently rendered .
Let us hear what Antony can say .
Sure ones , then .
Look , where she comes .
Thou look'st like him that knows a warlike charge .
Be'st thou sad or merry , The violence of either thee becomes , So does it no man else. , Mett'st thou my posts ?
I can tell you it will serve you to mend your shoes .
Indeed , that is out of the air .
I gave my love a ring and made him swear Never to part with it .
To bait fish withal .
Since my dear soul was mistress of her choice And could of men distinguish , her election Hath sealed thee for herself , for thou hast been , As one in suffering all that suffers nothing , A man that Fortune's buffets and rewards Hast ta'en with equal thanks .
It is the most impenetrable cur That ever kept with men .
Alas , sir , it is worse for me than so , For I have bills for money by exchange From Florence , and must here deliver them .
I'll make so bold to call , For 'tis my limited service .
Why , tell me , is not this my Cambio ?
If I have killed the issue of your womb , To quicken your increase I will beget Mine issue of your blood upon your daughter .
What we will do , we do upon command .
Bianca's love Made me exchange my state with Tranio , While he did bear my countenance in the town , And happily I have arrived at the last Unto the wished haven of my bliss .
Your servants tend .
Retire !
Nor I know not Where I did lodge last night .
Roderigo !
We will have such a prologue , and it shall be written in eight and six .
My lord , most humbly on my knee I beg The leading of the vaward .
My lord , in Athens .
Speak the speech , I pray you , as I pronounced it to you , trippingly on the tongue .
I am old and foolish .
Lives my sweet son ?
I'll be gone .
You are very welcome , sir .
I pray God he be not , I say .
They are all but stomachs , and we all but food .
He passes some humors and careers .
He says so , Tranio ?
But how , my lord , shall we resist it now ?
But as 'tis , We can not miss him .
Cleopatra , Do not abuse my master's bounty by Th' undoing of yourself .
Such wind as scatters young men through the world To seek their fortunes farther than at home , Where small experience grows .
Come hither , sir .
Twice did he turn his back and purposed so , But kindness , nobler ever than revenge , And nature , stronger than his just occasion , Made him give battle to the lioness , Who quickly fell before him ; in which hurtling , From miserable slumber I awaked .
All is but toys .
Kill !
I would not marry her , though she were endowed with all that Adam had left him before he transgressed .
Had you such leisure in the time of death To gaze upon the secrets of the deep ?
As sure , my liege , as I do see your Grace .
Truly , my name is Cinna .
I prithee let me have it .
Let every man be master of his time Till seven at night .
Then show it me .
Where is this rash and most unfortunate man ?
He may recover yet .
Ay , sir , in Pisa have I often been , Pisa renowned for grave citizens .
That a maiden's heart hath burned ?
Peace , Grumio .
Your statue spouting blood in many pipes , In which so many smiling Romans bathed , Signifies that from you great Rome shall suck Reviving blood , and that great men shall press For tinctures , stains , relics , and cognizance .
I'll rhyme you so eight years together , dinners and suppers and sleeping hours excepted .
I prithee , tell me who is it quickly , and speak apace .
There is further compliment of leave-taking between France and him .
How goes the world with thee ?
Is there no offense in 't ?
Let me love him for that , and do you love him because I do .
Things growing are not ripe until their season .
Shall they see us ?
Get thee hence .
How have I offended ?
A horse , a horse , my kingdom for a horse !
Why , that's all one .
My liberty .
Why hath thy queen Summoned me hither to this short-grassed green ?
You sent me for a rope's end as soon .
Lives he ?
He only in a general honest thought And common good to all , made one of them .
Do you not hear him ?
For your coming in to dinner , sir , why , let it be as humours and conceits shall govern .
By my faith , you have great reason to be sad .
Fie , Demetrius !
Not shine today ?
I this infer : That many things , having full reference To one consent , may work contrariously , As many arrows loosed several ways Come to one mark , as many ways meet in one town , As many fresh streams meet in one salt sea , As many lines close in the dial's center , So may a thousand actions , once afoot , End in one purpose , and be all well borne Without defeat .
A friend of Antony's .
I would not have such a heart in my bosom for the dignity of the whole body .
How , how , Cordelia ?
With one fool's head I came to woo , But I go away with two. , Sweet , adieu .
Take your time .
Not so , I do beseech your Majesty .
Helen , to you our minds we will unfold .
But soft , behold !
Relent , sweet Hermia , And , Lysander , yield Thy crazed title to my certain right .
What noise ?
Caesar , and that , having in Sicily Sextus Pompeius spoiled , we had not rated him His part o' th' isle .
It weeps , it bleeds , and each new day a gash Is added to her wounds .
To be acknowledged , madam , is o'erpaid .
Sir , I never loved you much , but I ha' praised ye When you have well deserved ten times as much As I have said you did .
Push home .
Foolish curs , that run winking into the mouth of a Russian bear and have their heads crushed like rotten apples .
I wish you all joy of the worm .
No , no , the bell .
Most kind messenger , Say to great Caesar this in deputation : I kiss his conqu'ring hand .
I will , my lord .
Troth , I think your other rebato were better .
Is it come to this ?
And what of him ?
I stand here for law .
Good morrow , Catesby .
A dear happiness to women .
No , but the barber's man hath been seen with him , and the old ornament of his cheek hath already stuffed tennis balls .
I must needs report the truth .
Now , soldiers , march away , And how Thou pleasest , God , dispose the day .
Farewell .
You durst not so have tempted him .
I have a ship Laden with gold .
Get you to bed again .
When the wind is southerly , I know a hawk from a handsaw .
I can not fly , But , bearlike , I must fight the course .
How now , cousin Hero !
But he that tempered thee bade thee stand up , Gave thee no instance why thou shouldst do treason , Unless to dub thee with the name of traitor .
No , boy .
The merchandise which thou hast brought from Rome Are all too dear for me .
That light we see is burning in my hall .
I am he .
Count Claudio ?
But , on : six Barbary horses against six French swords , their assigns , and three liberal-conceited carriages , that's the French bet against the Danish .
Ere he take ship for France , and in Southampton .
What's the matter ?
Let me see 'em .
Get thee gone , but do it .
Fathers , from hence trust not your daughters ' minds By what you see them act .
But these can not I command to any utterance of harmony .
It provokes the desire , but it takes away the performance .
Give me thy arm .
Hark , canst thou hear me ?
Barnardo ?
What handkerchief ?
We have store to do 't , And they have earned the waste .
Goes Fleance with you ?
Here comes his Majesty .
Well then , the peace which you before so urged Lies in his answer .
Knock , sir ?
Is 't lost ?
With the help of a surgeon he might yet recover and prove an ass .
I remember when I was in love I broke my sword upon a stone and bid him take that for coming a- night to Jane Smile .
What is thy name ?
Now I will believe That there are unicorns , that in Arabia There is one tree , the phoenix ' throne , one phoenix At this hour reigning there .
I wish mine eyes Would with themselves shut up my thoughts .
The prayers of holy saints and wronged souls , Like high-reared bulwarks , stand before our faces .
Oh , 'tis a gallant king !
Mistress , dispatch you with your safest haste , And get you from our court .
Be silent .
Cassio did top her , ask thy husband else .
No , by my life and soul !
And so , God be with him !
O , if thou wert the noblest of thy strain , Young man , thou couldst not die more honorable .
Let me come to her .
He hath given his empire Up to a whore ; who now are levying The kings o' th' earth for war .
I have sent to bid Cassio come speak with you .
Go on before .
I pray thee , Rosalind , sweet my coz , be merry .
I grant you , friends , if you should fright the ladies out of their wits , they would have no more discretion but to hang us .
Dost thou love pictures ?
We are enough yet living in the field To smother up the English in our throngs , If any order might be thought upon .
But when shall we set the savage bull's horns on the sensible Benedick's head ?
In all these circumstances I'll instruct you .
No , as I shall be saved .
Thou hast , Ventidius , that Without the which a soldier and his sword Grants scarce distinction .
What harmony is this ?
When being not at your lodging to be found The Senate hath sent about three several guests To search you out .
Make no noise , make no noise .
I thank you most for him .
Give me the gown .
Look you , Cassio and my husband !
How yet resolves the governor of the town ?
But canst thou guess that he doth aim at it ?
Tell me but truly , but then speak the truth , Do you not love my sister ?
What's your pleasure , sir ?
Yet must not we put the strong law on him .
But did you think the Prince would have served you thus ?
Tis true , my lords , he did .
Since Cleopatra died I have lived in such dishonor that the gods Detest my baseness .
I had rather be a canker in a hedge than a rose in his grace , and it better fits my blood to be disdained of all than to fashion a carriage to rob love from any .
Not I , sir .
Save you , friend Cassio !
And , I think , if my breast had not been made of faith , and my heart of steel , She had transformed me to a curtal dog and made me turn i ' th ' wheel .
Fathers that wear rags Do make their children blind .
Not Cassio killed !
In me 'tis villainy , In thee 't had been good service .
I dare not drink yet , madam .
Though the wisdom of nature can reason it thus and thus , yet nature finds itself scourged by the sequent effects .
O , that once more you knew but what you are !
Some wine , ho !
Tut , a toy !
Signior , it is the Moor .
Handkerchief , confessions , handkerchief !
By my fay , a goodly nap .
By my life , I do .
O noble English , that could entertain With half their forces the full pride of France And let another half stand laughing by , All out of work and cold for action !
The more fool you for laying on my duty .
I shall deliver so .
No man that's born of woman Shall e'er have power upon thee." Then fly , false thanes , And mingle with the English epicures .
By this kind of chase I should hate him , for my father hated his father dearly .
But speak you on .
If it be , sir , I pray you , eat none of it .
I was not angry since I came to France Until this instant .
But here they come .
It is not friendly , 'tis not maidenly .
I was a gentleman , And then I told you true .
What need'st thou run so many mile about When thou mayst tell thy tale the nearest way ?
I have a letter guessingly set down , Which came from one that's of a neutral heart , And not from one opposed .
And as with age his body uglier grows , So his mind cankers .
Tis here .
And so am I revenged. , That would be scanned .
But I have cause to pry into this pedant .
No , I warrant your Grace you shall not entreat him to a second , that have so mightily persuaded him from a first .
She will taste as like this as a crab does to a crab .
If you mark Alexander's life well , Harry of Monmouth's life is come after it indifferent well , for there is figures in all things .
A devil , a born devil on whose nature Nurture can never stick , on whom my pains , Humanely taken , all , all lost , quite lost .
Urge the necessity and state of times , And be not peevish found in great designs .
But is all this for your father ?
I never can see him but I am heartburned an hour after .
We'll mend our dinner here .
Gramercy !
This is a slave whose easy borrowed pride Dwells in the fickle grace of her he follows. , Out , varlet , from my sight !
Sir , most heedfully .
That you have wronged me doth appear in this : You have condemned and noted Lucius Pella For taking bribes here of the Sardians , Wherein my letters , praying on his side Because I knew the man , were slighted off .
The air breathes upon us here most sweetly .
Tomorrow shall you know our mind at full .
Who is 't that cried ?
I know my remedy .
Why do you send so thick ?
Thy master is a wise and valiant Roman .
Wear both of them , for both of them are thine .
Yes , the fashion is the fashion .
My words are dull .
This is no answer , thou unfeeling man , To excuse the current of thy cruelty .
Do you hear ?
Give us kind keepers , heavens !
You shall not stir out of your house today .
Be gone !
I would not follow him then .
Tis sport to maul a runner .
No !
Here comes Baptista .
If you can , your reason ?
Master , you looked so longly on the maid , Perhaps you marked not what's the pith of all .
Dromio , thou , Dromio , thou snail , thou slug , thou sot .
How may we try it further ?
These fifteen years !
Did I not , fellow ?
Am I not an inch of fortune better than she ?
I have marked A thousand blushing apparitions To start into her face , a thousand innocent shames In angel whiteness beat away those blushes , And in her eye there hath appeared a fire To burn the errors that these princes hold Against her maiden truth .
I shall see thee , ere I die , look pale with love .
With this strange virtue , He hath a heavenly gift of prophecy , And sundry blessings hang about his throne , That speak him full of grace .
For if thou dost intend Never so little show of love to her , Thou shalt aby it .
What , were you snarling all before I came , Ready to catch each other by the throat , And turn you all your hatred now on me ?
Where is the beauteous majesty of Denmark ?
I will not stay to offend you .
Both which , Master Constable , You have .
Let it be written in eight and eight .
Off with that bauble , throw it underfoot .
And , good lieutenant , I think you think I love you .
I know that virtue to be in you , Brutus , As well as I do know your outward favor .
I will weep .
My sweet Cassio !
Say that I lingered with you at your shop To see the making of her carcanet , And that tomorrow you will bring it home .
It was , as I have seen it in his life , A sable silvered .
Why , what else ?
I'll seal to such a bond , And say there is much kindness in the Jew .
I pray thee , give it me .
Hark !
Indeed , it is a strange-disposed time .
Farewell .
I prithee now , lead the way without any more talking. , Trinculo , the king and all our company else being drowned , we will inherit here. , Here , bear my bottle. , Fellow Trinculo , we'll fill him by and by again .
May be she doth but counterfeit .
Nay , 'tis twice two months , my lord .
Had I not Four or five women once that tended me ?
Oh , that we then could come by Caesar's spirit And not dismember Caesar !
But that's all one : omittance is no quittance .
It is hypocrisy against the devil .
Thy currish spirit Governed a wolf who , hanged for human slaughter , Even from the gallows did his fell soul fleet , And whilst thou layest in thy unhallowed dam Infused itself in thee , for thy desires Are wolvish , bloody , starved , and ravenous .
What features ?
And to that place the sharp Athenian law Can not pursue us .
No , let me not .
Judgment ?
Nor heaven nor earth have been at peace tonight .
You stayed well by 't in Egypt .
Swart like my shoe , but her face nothing like so clean kept .
When ?
My royal lord , You do not give the cheer .
If I could bid the fifth welcome with so good a heart as I can bid the other four farewell , I should be glad of his approach .
The English force , so please you .
What , are there masques ?
The foul practice Hath turned itself on me .
She can not deny it .
Not so .
Ah , do not tear away thyself from me !
Fiery" ?
Call my train together. , Degenerate bastard , I'll not trouble thee .
How "seventh cause" ? , Good my lord , like this fellow .
Fie , fie , fie , pah , pah ! , Give me an ounce of civet , good apothecary , to sweeten my imagination .
Cry the man mercy , love him , take his offer .
And for his dreams , I wonder he's so simple To trust the mock'ry of unquiet slumbers .
To our shores Throng many doubtful hollow-hearted friends , Unarmed and unresolved to beat them back .
Good countrymen , let me depart alone .
Not if the small come first .
Live , Brutus !
Take not the quarrel from His powerful arm ; He needs no indirect or lawless course To cut off those that have offended Him .
Come on .
We will not fail .
Or he that slew her brothers and her uncles ?
Now he tells how she plucked him to my chamber .
You have heard much .
What shall I do ?
Caesar , I will .
So she may live unscarred of bleeding slaughter , I will confess she was not Edward's daughter .
Here comes my messenger. , How now , mad spirit ?
Why he more than another ?
Go a little before .
But since he is better we have therefore odds .
Who doth he gallop withal ?
Yonder , sir , he walks .
So should the murdered look , and so should I , Pierced through the heart with your stern cruelty .
Enobarbus , Antony Hath after thee sent all thy treasure , with His bounty overplus .
Here comes Ancient Pistol and his wife .
Wherefore to Dover ?
I do not bid thee call .
I pray thee , peace .
I will preach to thee .
He was quick mettle when he went to school .
How that might change his nature , there's the question .
But , alas the while !
My mind is changed .
I would give all my fame for a pot of ale , and safety .
Alas , poor ghost !
Your Highness told me I should post before .
If thou wilt weep my fortunes , take my eyes .
Demetrius is a worthy gentleman .
My voice is ragged .
Caesar , 'tis strucken eight .
Brother , Content yourself .
I grant I am a woman , but withal A woman that Lord Brutus took to wife .
Give me some little breath , some pause , dear lord , Before I positively speak in this .
It hath the primal eldest curse upon 't , A brother's murder .
You or any man living may be drunk at a time , man .
When will he be here ?
There is occasions and causes why and wherefore in all things .
It can not be .
I am paid for 't now .
O eastern star !
Beware the ides of March .
But if you do refuse to marry me , You'll give yourself to this most faithful shepherd ?
But your news is not true .
How think you of it ?
Not to be endured .
A joint stool .
I would eat his heart in the marketplace .
Noble captain , come .
White-livered runagate , what doth he there ?
I'll mend it and then play , Where's the Queen ?
Proceed .
Nay , then indeed she can not choose but hate thee , Having bought love with such a bloody spoil .
Go to .
Will you walk in to see their gossiping ?
Ay , so I think .
Ay , and a kind one too .
News , my good lord , from Rome .
Princes and counties !
We had like to have had our two noses snapped off with two old men without teeth .
Methinks our garments are now as fresh as when we put them on first in Afric , at the marriage of the king's fair daughter Claribel to the King of Tunis .
God's benison go with you and with those That would make good of bad and friends of foes .
I must talk a word with you .
Did you say with Cassio ?
Did you say all ?
A laughter .
Look to her , Moor , if thou hast eyes to see .
For , as I am a soldier , A name that in my thoughts becomes me best , If I begin the batt'ry once again , I will not leave the half-achieved Harfleur Till in her ashes she lie buried .
Macbeth shall never vanquished be until Great Birnam Wood to high Dunsinane Hill Shall come against him .
Well , let it strike .
Up in the air , crowned with the golden sun , Saw his heroical seed and smiled to see him Mangle the work of nature and deface The patterns that by God and by French fathers Had twenty years been made .
Will you go ?
Well , sir , we will not .
Follow" ?
Good majesty , Herod of Jewry dare not look upon you But when you are well pleased .
Tis a match .
Oh , the heavens !
Your Majesty , hear now , saving your Majesty's manhood , what an arrant , rascally , beggarly , lousy knave it is .
What hast thou to do ? , Father , be quiet .
There , take my coxcomb .
Come in , tailor .

Thou art a fool .
I overheard him and his practices .
Silenced with that , In viewing o'er the rest o ' the selfsame day , He finds thee in the stout Norweyan ranks , Nothing afeard of what thyself didst make , Strange images of death .
I am for the air .
Go to , say you nothing .
That a monster should be such a natural !
After dinner Your hazard shall be made .
Shall I strike at it with my partisan ?
In mine eye she is the sweetest lady that ever I looked on .
Did you perceive how he laughed at his vice ?
Good shepherd , tell this youth what 'tis to love .
Is ink and paper ready ?
Fare you well , boy .
Twas a rough night .
A most scurvy monster .
O traitors , villains !
Thou speak'st with all thy wit ; and yet , i ' faith , With wit enough for thee .
Who's there ?
Do as I bid thee .
Hark !
Where is he , in his bed ?
The higher Nilus swells The more it promises .
Then brook abridgment , and your eyes advance After your thoughts , straight back again to France .
She said so .
Who ?
If thou art she , tell me where is that son That floated with thee on the fatal raft ?
As you on him , Demetrius dote on you !
If your Majesties is remembered of it , the Welshmen did good service in a garden where leeks did grow , wearing leeks in their Monmouth caps , which , your Majesty know , to this hour is an honorable badge of the service .
Yea , but you must not make the full show of this till you may do it without controlment .
Mark him .
No , pray thee , let it serve for table talk .
I thank God , I thank God !
The hour steals on .
Hail !
Come , let us sup betimes , that afterwards We may digest our complots in some form .
He knows that you embrace not Antony As you did love , but as you feared him .
He and Lepidus are at Caesar's house .
Hear me a word , For I shall never speak to thee again .
I will not say so , for fear I should be faced out of my way .
Now , by my mother's son , and that's myself , It shall be moon , or star , or what I list , Or e'er I journey to your father's house .
I am not to you known , Though in your state of honor I am perfect .
Right , as snow in harvest .
Contemning Rome , he has done all this and more In Alexandria .
The question of his death is enrolled in the Capitol .
Words without thoughts never to heaven go .
Then be your eyes the witness of their evil .
These lily lips , This cherry nose , These yellow cowslip cheeks Are gone , are gone .
O me , my heart , my rising heart !
O hard condition , Twin-born with greatness , subject to the breath Of every fool , whose sense no more can feel But his own wringing .
With the earl , sir , here within .
My little spirit , see , Sits in a foggy cloud and stays for me .
What villains have done this ?
Yes , that you did , sir , and forswore it too .
Speak yet again .
Happier than this , She is not bred so dull but she can learn .
Are they all ready ?
Incapable and shallow innocents , You can not guess who caused your father's death .
The time to come .
How old are you , friend ?
Good night .
Brutus" will start a spirit as soon as "Caesar." Now in the names of all the gods at once , Upon what meat doth this our Caesar feed That he is grown so great ?
This was well done , my bird .
And then came Pyramus .
If they deny to come , Swinge me them soundly forth unto their husbands .
Dead , dead ?
How now , my love ?
Marry , as for Clarence , he is well repaid ; He is franked up to fatting for his pains .
If thou dost play with him at any game , Thou art sure to lose , and of that natural luck He beats thee 'gainst the odds .
Mum , then , and no more .
I pray you mar no more of my verses with reading them ill- favoredly .
Pray you , look not sad , Nor make replies of loathness .
This feather stirs .
I know that , but I would have thee hence and here again .
Hold , for shame !
I am aweary of this moon .
In troth , 'tis morning .
Who would not have his wife so ?
Die and be damned , and It is well .
Sir , I lack advancement .
Let the old ruffian know I have many other ways to die , meantime Laugh at his challenge .
What were these ?
Here comes Brabantio and the valiant Moor .
By this sword , he that makes the first thrust , I'll kill him .
Let him greet England with our sharp defiance .
You take my house when you do take the prop That doth sustain my house .
Follow not .
There to meet with Macbeth .
You must not stay here longer .
He will not fight with me , Domitius ?
No , though thou call'st thyself a hotter name Than any is in hell .
Your ear is good .
This is a man , old , wrinkled , faded , withered , And not a maiden , as thou say'st he is .
He's speaking now , Or murmuring "Where's my serpent of old Nile ? " For so he calls me .
Sextus Pompeius Makes his approaches to the port of Rome .
I must confess your offer is the best , And , let your father make her the assurance , She is your own ; else , you must pardon me .
Clubs can not part them .
Ay .
Fourscore ducats !
But he comes armed in his fortune and prevents the slander of his wife .
So bless thee , master .
In wisdom I should ask thy name .
I'll be before thee .
It was divided Between her heart and lips .
Is she shrill-tongued or low ?
He did bewray his practice , and received This hurt you see striving to apprehend him .
Myself am Naples , Who with mine eyes , never since at ebb , beheld The king my father wracked .
They flatter me .
He had a thousand noses , Horns whelked and waved like the enraged sea .
My babes were destined to a fairer death If grace had blessed thee with a fairer life .
What , man , 'tis a night of revels !
If he ask for me , I am ill and gone to bed .
Ay , to the proof , as mountains are for winds , That shakes not , though they blow perpetually .
What ish my nation ?
You must not think then that I am drunk .
I dare make his answer , none .
Then keep thy vow , sirrah , when thou meet'st the fellow .
Look with thine ears .
Why , how now , Charmian ?
Shall Caesar send a lie ?
To what end did I bid thee hie thee home ?
Fie , there is no such man .
That ?
Why sinks that cauldron ?
Tis a wild night .
Write down "Master Gentleman Conrade." , Masters , do you serve God ?
By my troth , I am sick .
Lo , where it comes again .
Oh , I am slain ! , My lord , you have one eye left To see some mischief on him .
If any such there be , heaven pardon him !
The Queen shall then have courtesy , so she Will yield us up ?
No more with me .
Good guard Until their greater pleasures first be known That are to censure them .
A could never abide carnation .
Oh , here it is .
I do not know One of my sex , no woman's face remember , Save , from my glass , mine own .
Thou flea , thou nit , thou winter cricket thou !
This is the day wherein I wished to fall By the false faith of him who most I trusted .
Come .
A very honest-hearted fellow , and as poor as the king .
Then swore he that he was a stranger here .
Ah , for our father , for our dear lord Clarence !
A very handsome man .
What a thrice-double ass Was I , to take this drunkard for a god And worship this dull fool !
Do thy duty , and have thy duty , for my master and mistress are almost frozen to death .
You shall be a woodmonger and buy nothing of me but cudgels .
He hath .
As he was fortunate , I rejoice at it .
I have 't .
Therefore use thy discretion .
My services to your lordship .
It shall do well .
Sport ?
I may not breathe my censure What he might be .
This night , wherein the cub-drawn bear would couch , The lion and the belly-pinched wolf Keep their fur dry , unbonneted he runs , And bids what will take all .
I'll take my leave .
He is not doubted. , A word , Lucillius .
You envy my advancement , and my friends ' .
Bid farewell to your sisters .
Oh , ho , monster , we know what belongs to a frippery. , Put off that gown , Trinculo .
Faith , he tonight hath boarded a land carrack .
Good morrow , Brutus .
It is a branch and parcel of mine oath , A charitable duty of my order .
Do thou meet me presently at the harbor. , Come hither .
My lord , he doth deny to come .
Up to the breach , you dogs !
Thomas the earl of Surrey and himself , Much about cockshut time , from troop to troop Went through the army cheering up the soldiers .
Here's the place .
Most gracious Duke , To my unfolding lend your prosperous ear And let me find a charter in your voice , T ' assist my simpleness .
He speaks home , madam .
This a good block .
This island's mine , by Sycorax my mother , Which thou takest from me .

But by sea he is an absolute master .
Thy luster thickens When he shines by .
Let it go .
These be good humors .
You sulfurous and thought-executing fires , Vaunt-couriers of oak-cleaving thunderbolts , Singe my white head !
It must be shortly known to him from England What is the issue of the business there .
That which I gave you .
Worthy prince , I know 't .
List , list , O , list !
You must sing This nothing's more than matter .
Our fraughtage , sir , I have conveyed aboard , and I have bought The oil , the balsamum and aqua vitae .
It was , so please your highness .
Go and importune her .
I have done ill , Of which I do accuse myself so sorely That I will joy no more .
Is 't like that lead contains her ?
I long that we were safe and sound aboard .
But though I am a daughter to his blood , I am not to his manners .
Hear , Nature , hear , dear goddess , hear !
Now is the time of help .
So .
Or do you play the flouting jack , to tell us Cupid is a good hare-finder and Vulcan a rare carpenter ?
Pardon me , I pray you .

My best way is to creep under his gaberdine .
Pray you now , Nay , do so , for indeed I have lost command .

Madam , you must come to your uncle .
Would it were mortal poison for thy sake .
I will not do them wrong .
It is no mean happiness , therefore , to be seated in the mean .
Their aunt I am in law , in love their mother .
Where is the thousand marks thou hadst of me ?
Good Portia , go to bed .
Wilt thou lay hands on me , villain ?
I will not think it .
Ay , and for that thou diest .
She will sit you , you heard my daughter tell you how .
Were 't my fitness To let these hands obey my blood , They are apt enough to dislocate and tear Thy flesh and bones .
Now , gods , stand up for bastards !

By heaven , it is the same I gave the doctor !

Oh , that I were a man !
Who's there ?
What is between you ?
Go , borrow me a crow .
Therefore your Grace may well say I have lost it .
What , frighted with false fire ?
But , too unruly deer , he breaks the pale And feeds from home .
The time will bring it out .
You'd be king o ' th ' isle , sirrah ?
I deny it not .
Sblood , do you think I am easier to be played on than a pipe ?
Nay , I prithee stay a little .
A friend .
Shed thou no blood , nor cut thou less nor more But just a pound of flesh .
I hear The strain of strutting chanticleer Cry "Cock-a-diddle-dow." Where should this music be ?
You do assist the storm .
No , I warrant you .
Thou bloodier villain Than terms can give thee out !
Tis bargained 'twixt us twain , being alone , That she shall still be curst in company .
How are they escoted ?
How , how I pray you ?
Have you that I sent you for ?
Where's Monsieur Mustardseed ?
But will you woo this wildcat ?
What's Antony ?

His glory not extenuated wherein he was worthy , nor his offenses enforced for which he suffered death .
To fetch her fan , her gloves , her mask , nor nothing ?

I could munch your good dry oats .
Is thy name William ?
It may be so , my lord .
They clepe us drunkards and with swinish phrase Soil our addition .
Is it so , countrymen ?

By heaven , I charge thee , speak .
I think you are all mated or stark mad .
These gloves the Count sent me , they are an excellent perfume .
O , well flown , bird .
Well , I know not What counts harsh Fortune casts upon my face , But in my bosom shall she never come To make my heart her vassal .
Faith , that was not so well .
Is 't not denounced against us ?
So the fool follows after .
Fight valiantly today .
What committed ?
I humbly do beseech you of your pardon For too much loving you .
I pray you , give me leave .
Small joy have I in being England's queen .
The king hath heard them , to the which as yet There is no answer made .
This gentleman will out-talk us all .
How , in one house , Should many people under two commands Hold amity ?
I like not that .
Now , by my holidam , here comes Katherina !
To find out you .
Signor Bassanio , hear me .
Oh , quick , or I am gone .
Mark the music .
Do they grow rusty ?
Why , as I told thee , 'tis a custom with him , I ' th ' afternoon to sleep .
What is the success ?
Besides , they have burned and carried away all that was in the king's tent , wherefore the king , most worthily , hath caused every soldier to cut his prisoner's throat .
And thy father Was Duke of Milan , and thou his only heir And princess no worse issued .
How do you , women ?
Hence with your little ones .
Tomorrow , sir , I wrestle for my credit , and he that escapes me without some broken limb shall acquit him well .
And speak 't again , my lord .
Thou canst not frown , thou canst not look askance , Nor bite the lip as angry wenches will , Nor hast thou pleasure to be cross in talk .
Please you , farther .
It is good to grow .
Nay , but hear me .
Farewell , and thanks .
Tell her the king , that may command , entreats , That , at her hands , which the king's King forbids .

She that herself will sliver and disbranch From her material sap perforce must wither And come to deadly use .
They shout for joy .

Our general cast us thus early for the love of his Desdemona , who let us not therefore blame .
Have you heard of no likely wars toward 'twixt the two Dukes of Cornwall and Albany ?
Any strange beast there makes a man .
Ah ha !
And therefore tell me , most fair Katherine , will you have me ?
I have sent twenty out to seek for you .
I thank it , poor fool , it keeps on the windy side of care .
Dost thou think I care for a satire or an epigram ?
Give me my sword .
O , yet defend me , friends .
Nay , that would be as great a soil in the new gloss of your marriage as to show a child his new coat and forbid him to wear it .
Tomorrow will it please you to be crowned ?
O sirs , consider : they that set you on To do this deed will hate you for the deed .
Bid him set on his powers betimes before , And we will follow .
Varrus and Claudio !
All things are ready if our minds be so .
I do so , I confess it .
Ay , ay .
I will debate this matter at more leisure And teach your ears to list me with more heed .
I will hide me in the arbor .
O dear Phoebe , If ever , as that ever may be near , You meet in some fresh cheek the power of fancy , Then shall you know the wounds invisible That love's keen arrows make .
Pray you , tread softly , that the blind mole may not hear a foot fall .
With patience , noble lord , as prisoners must .
Much will be seen in that .
Yes , he is dead .
As with the meat , some undeserved fault I'll find about the making of the bed , And here I'll fling the pillow , there the bolster , This way the coverlet , another way the sheets .
Nor will not .
Shall I tell you why ?
To the breach , to the breach !
Now .
Our yoke and sufferance show us womanish .
Ay , madam .
Lucius !
Off with his son George's head !
Gremio , 'tis now no time to vent our love .
He only lived but till he was a man , The which no sooner had his prowess confirmed In the unshrinking station where he fought , But like a man he died .
Consent to pay thee that I never had ? , Arrest me , foolish fellow , if thou dar'st .
Caesar should be a beast without a heart If he should stay at home today for fear .
Hark further .
Full of vexation come I with complaint Against my child , my daughter Hermia. , Stand forth , Demetrius. , My noble lord , This man hath my consent to marry her. , Stand forth , Lysander. , And my gracious duke , This man hath bewitched the bosom of my child. , Thou , thou , Lysander , thou hast given her rhymes , And interchanged love tokens with my child .
Come , Charmian .
Is this face Hero's ?
Yet Brutus says he was ambitious , And Brutus is an honorable man .
Softly , my masters .
If she be a traitor , Why so am I .
Tears his white hair , Which the impetuous blasts , with eyeless rage , Catch in their fury and make nothing of .
When came this to you ?
Grumio , my horse .
You are too much mistaken in this king .
Fortune and victory sit on thy helm !
By what rule , sir ?
Why , so I do .
Will he bring his power ?
At Pembroke , or at Ha'rfordwest in Wales .
Came you from Padua , from Bellario ?
They murder Caesar ! " , Who's within ?
You'll let us in , I hope ?
Nothing but songs of death .

O Corin , that thou knew'st how I do love her !
And mine , two hundred .

What means that bloody knife ?
Bring me to Antony .
Young man , have you challenged Charles the wrestler ?

My arm is sore .
Who is 't that hinders you ?
By my faith , he is very swift and sententious .
Our severed navy too Have knit again , and fleet , threat'ning most sealike .
Which of these sorrows is he subject to ?
Give me thy hand .
Directly , I am going to Caesar's funeral .
Wherefore was that cry ?
And a good soldier too , lady .
What needed , then , that terrible dispatch of it into your pocket ?
Oh , God defend me !
Where is thy luster now ?
Gramercies , Tranio , well dost thou advise .
Yond island carrions , desperate of their bones , Ill-favoredly become the morning field .
O Isis , 'tis impossible .
Kneel not , gentle Portia .
An he should , it were an alms to hang him .
I shall not look upon his like again .
Make her amends , she weeps .
Then , to answer every man directly and briefly , wisely and truly , wisely I say , I am a bachelor .
At a word , I am not .
You are not , Cassius .
What , my good lord ?
Then there is the County Palatine .
Abhorred slave , Which any print of goodness wilt not take , Being capable of all ill !
What is his name ?
Good , yet remember whom thou hast aboard .
She has light by her continually .
Dismayed not this our captains , Macbeth and Banquo ?
This would drink deep .
O Lord , he will hang upon him like a disease !
And golden Phoebus never be beheld Of eyes again so royal !
Well , let that rest .
I marry her !
I am not taught to make anything .
If he fail of that , He will have other means to cut you off .
With all my heart .
And what's the news , good cousin Lodovico ?
What think'st thou , will our friends prove all true ?
We wish your peace .
It shall be done , my lord .
Morton is fled to Richmond , And Buckingham , backed with the hardy Welshmen , Is in the field , and still his power increaseth .
I repent me much That so I harried him .
Father , and wife , and gentlemen , adieu .
Nay , he hath but a little beard .
Thou naughty knave , what trade ?
Ay , marry , am I , sir ; and now 'tis plotted !
Seek thine own ease .
The voice of Cassio .
Lay her i ' th ' earth , And from her fair and unpolluted flesh May violets spring !
Thou old unhappy traitor , Briefly thyself remember .
Fa , sol , la , mi .
Here , Fluellen , wear thou this favor for me and stick it in thy cap .
But I will not stir from this place , do what they can .
When I spoke that , I was ill-tempered too .
And since you know you can not see yourself So well as by reflection , I , your glass , Will modestly discover to yourself That of yourself which you yet know not of .
And you , good yeoman , Whose limbs were made in England , show us here The mettle of your pasture .
What are thy comings in ?
But , God be thanked , there is no need of me , And much I need to help you , were there need .
By Jupiter , This shall not be revoked .
how am I beset ! , What kind of catechizing call you this ?
Kill the poys and the luggage !
What , will you have them weep our horses ' blood ?
Alas !
To whose hands You have sent the lunatic king .
What would my lord ?
She shows a body rather than a life , A statue than a breather .
In such a night Did young Lorenzo swear he loved her well , Stealing her soul with many vows of faith , And ne'er a true one .
Farewell .
Called you , my lord ?
Liar and slave !
If it be that , If it be that , or any that was hers , It speaks against her with the other proofs .
Rome , thou hast lost the breed of noble bloods !
Tranio , you jest .
Now , Signior Petruchio , how speed you with my daughter ?
I led them on in this distracted fear And left sweet Pyramus translated there .
I said thou hadst a fine wit .
He is my prisoner .
Why do you dress me In borrowed robes ?
The more I hate , the more he follows me .
In your bad strokes , Brutus , you give good words .
Ay , ay , three thousand ducats .
But , as they say , to hear music the general does not greatly care .
The day will come that thou shalt wish for me To help thee curse that poisonous bunch-backed toad .
There's my cap .
I would be loath to have you overflown with a honey bag , signor .
As for my wife , I would you had her spirit in such another .
Mark it , nuncle .
Queen Margaret saw Thy murd'rous falchion smoking in his blood , The which thou once didst bend against her breast , But that thy brothers beat aside the point .
It is not very strange .
Leave him to my displeasure. , Edmund , keep you our sister company .
And turns the sun to shade .
Ay ; and let none enter , lest I break your pate .
Think it no more .
I'll set a bourn how far to be beloved .
How comes it ?
Hear you , sir ?
Ay , my lord .
Ay , my lord .
Villains , you did not so when your vile daggers Hacked one another in the sides of Caesar .
Is this true ?
Watch me like Argus .
If thus thou vanishest , thou tell'st the world It is not worth leave-taking .
I tell thee , I , that thou hast marred her gown .
Tis true , this god did shake !
Go you before , and I will follow you .
Why , what did I ?
But , Lepidus , go you to Caesar's house .
I prithee , Strato , stay thou by thy lord .
And I do hope good days and long to see .
And I will purge thy mortal grossness so That thou shalt like an airy spirit go. , Peaseblossom , Cobweb , Moth , and Mustardseed !
Alas , gentlemen , Help , ho ! , Lieutenant , sir , Montano , Help , masters ! , Here's a goodly watch indeed !
Be bold , and take thy stand .
There's a division betwixt the dukes .
Our separated fortune Shall keep us both the safer .
My men should call me "lord." I am your goodman .
That will I make before I let thee go .
The fault's your own .
No jewel is like Rosalind .
I know not by what power I am made bold Nor how it may concern my modesty In such a presence here to plead my thoughts , But I beseech your grace that I may know The worst that may befall me in this case , If I refuse to wed Demetrius .
Oh , he has given example for our flight Most grossly by his own !
Fare you well .
Thou shalt have nothing but the forfeiture To be so taken at thy peril , Jew .
The play's the thing Wherein I'll catch the conscience of the king .
At night we'll feast together .
Yes , I know thee to be Signior Lucentio .
Who is 't that can inform me ?
Ergo , Master Launcelot .
Fare thee well .
Now am I dead .
Only th' adulterous Antony , most large In his abominations , turns you off And gives his potent regiment to a trull That noises it against us .
By Hercules , I think I am i' th' right .
Good .
Say , how is that ?
Fast bind , fast find .
This is the day which , in King Edward's time , I wished might fall on me when I was found False to his children and his wife's allies .
Let him that loves me strike me dead .
That I did love the Moor to live with him , My downright violence and storm of fortunes May trumpet to the world .
The skies are painted with unnumbered sparks .
Uncle !
Stand !
If the English had any apprehension , they would run away .
you know me well .
The consequence is , then , thy jealous fits Have scared thy husband from the use of wits .
Fair Leda's daughter had a thousand wooers ; Then well one more may fair Bianca have .
he whom next thyself Of all the world I loved and to him put The manage of my state , as at that time Through all the signories it was the first , And Prospero the prime duke , being so reputed In dignity , and for the liberal arts Without a parallel .
Approach .
Who is here so rude that would not be a Roman ?
They'll kill us .
What is the matter , masters ? , Honest Iago , that looks dead with grieving , Speak , who began this ?
And yet no matter .
Petruchio , stand by a while .
But is there no sequel at the heels of this mother's admiration ?
A thousand , sir , Early though 't be , have on their riveted trim And at the port expect you .
Know you before whom , sir ?
Nay , that's certain .
Here , here comes Master Signior Leonato , and the Sexton too .
And for the rest o ' th ' fleet , Which I dispersed , they all have met again And are upon the Mediterranean float , Bound sadly home for Naples , Supposing that they saw the king's ship wracked And his great person perish .
O mercy , God !
You are in the right .
What have I kept back ?
Tis well I am found by you .
If it were so , it was a grievous fault , And grievously hath Caesar answered it .
Come , let's away to prison .
The king rises .
I pray you tell me your remedy .
God grant we never may have need of you .
Hail to thee , thane of Glamis !
By heaven , I'll have 't .
Drown cats and blind puppies !
Alack , what heinous sin is it in me To be ashamed to be my father's child !
Pish !
So perhaps did yours .
Come , sirs .
Humbly on my knee I crave your blessing .
By th ' mass , and 'tis like a camel indeed .
Every inordinate cup is unblessed and the ingredient is a devil .
He brings great news .
That Petruchio came ?
He did bespeak a chain for me but had it not .
The captain , Give it the captain .
I can keep honest counsel , ride , run , mar a curious tale in telling it , and deliver a plain message bluntly .
Caesar himself has work , and our oppression Exceeds what we expected .
Nor , I am sure , there is no force in eyes That can do hurt .
It is just so high as it is , and moves with its own organs .
Lovers , make moan .
I should not urge thy duty past thy might .
By any other house or person ?
You are a merry man , sir .
Cassio , may you suspect Who they should be that have thus mangled you ?
Meet me by and by at the citadel .
Madam , here comes my lord .
The foe vaunts in the field .
Our size of sorrow , Proportioned to our cause , must be as great As that which makes it .
Must there no more be done ?
If not , shun me , and I will spare your haunts .
Not one to throw at a dog .
We'll teach you to drink deep ere you depart .
And what confederacy have you with the traitors Late footed in the kingdom ?
If you have any music that may not be heard , to 't again .
What , wouldst thou have me go and beg my food , Or with a base and boist'rous sword enforce A thievish living on the common road ?
Your sword upon a woman ?
From seventeen years till now almost fourscore Here lived I , but now live here no more .
If fortune be not ours today , it is Because we brave her .
My lord , I warrant you we will play our part As he shall think by our true diligence He is no less than what we say he is .
Now in respect it is in the fields , it pleaseth me well ; but in respect it is not in the court , it is tedious .
Look , here it is .
Thy master and his man are here , And that is false thou dost report to us .
They are coming to the play .
Adieu , Lest our old robes sit easier than our new !
For shame , you generals !
Wilt thou lift up Olympus ?
It is too heavy for your Grace to wear .
They would not have you to stir forth today .
How the moon sleeps with Endymion And would not be awaked .
I commanded the sleeves should be cut out and sewed up again , and that I'll prove upon thee , though thy little finger be armed in a thimble .
O Iago , the pity of it , Iago !
Go to .
This is his second fit .
Apollo plays , And twenty caged nightingales do sing : Or wilt thou sleep ?
And why not the swift foot of time ?
For as thou urgest justice , be assured Thou shalt have justice more than thou desirest .
What need the bridge much broader than the flood ?
Soon at five o'clock , Please you , I'll meet with you upon the mart And afterward consort you till bedtime .
Why not , my lord ?
Marry , sir , to get a husband for her sister .
Error i ' the bill , sir , error i ' the bill !
Thou hast not , cousin .
Who is most inward with the noble duke ?
No , my noble lord .
How dost thou feel thyself now ?
The court awards it , and the law doth give it .
Soft , Caesar .
Sweet friends , your patience for my long abode .
Dost thou squiny at me ?
All other devils that suggest by treasons Do botch and bungle up damnation With patches , colors , and with forms being fetched From glist'ring semblances of piety .
Officers , what offense have these men done ?
A more unhappy lady , If this division chance , ne'er stood between , Praying for both parts .
Very like a whale .
Have an eye to Cinna .
Who brought it ?
The dropsy drown this fool !
The reason why the seven stars are no more than seven is a pretty reason .
Set me where you stand .
Somebody knocks .
This man said , sir , that Don John , the Prince's brother , was a villain .
By Cheshu , he is an ass , as in the world .
He will do all in all as Hastings doth .
Oh , 'tis treason !
Give me answer to it .
Make us thy ministers of chastisement , That we may praise thee in the victory !
Come , Balthasar , we'll hear that song again .
Stanley , what news with you ?
Unfought withal , but I will sell my dukedom To buy a slobb'ry and a dirty farm In that nook-shotten isle of Albion .
Let me live here ever .
I have it here about me .
Go and say We purpose her no shame .
I do not set my life in a pin's fee , And for my soul , what can it do to that , Being a thing immortal as itself ?
Ay , and this .
I'll call upon you ere you go to bed And tell you what I know .
Wherefore is that ?
How now , general ?
Who's that which rings the bell ? , Diablo , ho !
You wrong me every way .
Strangle her in her bed , even the bed she hath contaminated .
Well , we will leave you then till dinnertime .
Before God , and in my mind , very wise .
And what have I to give you back whose worth May counterpoise this rich and precious gift ?
Whither wander you ?
I answer you ?
Make me to see 't , or at the least so prove it That the probation bear no hinge nor loop To hang a doubt on , or woe upon thy life !
Yes , by heaven !
Well , Brutus , thou art noble .
I am fire and air , my other elements I give to baser life. , So , have you done ?
I was the other day talking on the sea-bank with certain Venetians , and thither comes the bauble and , by this hand , she falls me thus about my neck , Crying "O dear Cassio ! " as it were .
I charge thee , be not thou more grieved than I am .
Grim-visaged war hath smoothed his wrinkled front ; And now , instead of mounting barbed steeds To fright the souls of fearful adversaries , He capers nimbly in a lady's chamber To the lascivious pleasing of a lute .
What though he love your Hermia ?
Peace !
Name them .
He may show what outward courage he will , but I believe , as cold a night as 'tis , he could wish himself in Thames up to the neck ; and so I would he were , and I by him , at all adventures , so we were quit here .
I ' th ' air or th ' earth ?
Some oracle Must rectify our knowledge .
Hail to thee , lady , and the grace of heaven , Before , behind thee , and on every hand , Enwheel thee round !
I pray you call them in .
If you go on thus , you will kill yourself , And 'tis not wisdom thus to second grief Against yourself .
Did this companion with the saffron face Revel and feast it at my house today Whilst upon me the guilty doors were shut And I denied to enter in my house ?
Now I perceive they have conjoined all three To fashion this false sport , in spite of me. , Injurious Hermia !
Away !
How many then should cover that stand bare !
Neglected , rather , And then when poisoned hours had bound me up From mine own knowledge .
If justice can not tame you , she shall ne'er weigh more reasons in her balance .
Let's not consort with them .
But , for mine own part , it was Greek to me .
Antonio is a good man .
And fair words to them .
I will this night , In several hands , in at his windows throw , As if they came from several citizens , Writings all tending to the great opinion That Rome holds of his name , wherein obscurely Caesar's ambition shall be glanced at .
I think that one of them is hereabout , And can not make away .
I am to blame .
Who , he ?
You would be satisfied ?
If there be truth in sight , you are my daughter .
Is not their climate foggy , raw , and dull , On whom , as in despite , the sun looks pale , Killing their fruit with frowns ?
Not her that chides , sir , at any hand , I pray .
Why no , boy .
And so do I .
Our fortune lies Upon this jump .
He is a sailmaker in Bergamo .
In the most high and palmy state of Rome , A little ere the mightiest Julius fell , The graves stood tenantless and the sheeted dead Did squeak and gibber in the Roman streets As stars with trains of fire and dews of blood , Disasters in the sun , and the moist star Upon whose influence Neptune's empire stands Was sick almost to doomsday with eclipse .
Holla !
Tell me your counsels .
Remember me .
Be patient .
First , madam , he is well .
My daughter tells us all .
If you do meet Horatio and Marcellus , The rivals of my watch , bid them make haste .
What is the matter , ho ?
What Tranio did , myself enforced him to .
I shall , King Harry .
Madam , not yet .
No , no , he's gone .
Search every acre in the high-grown field , And bring him to our eye .
Where have I been ?
More villain thou. , Well , push him out of doors And let my officers of such a nature Make an extent upon his house and lands .
When didst thou sleep when such a deed was done ?
There's not , I think , a subject That sits in heart-grief and uneasiness Under the sweet shade of your government .
Go to thy cold bed and warm thee .
Now he'll outstare the lightning .
Wherein the toged consuls can propose As masterly as he .
I would have blowed up the town , so Chrish save me , la , in an hour .
So shall I , love , And so , I pray , be you .
Tis strange , my Theseus , that these lovers speak of .
But this is trifling , And all the more it seeks to hide itself The bigger bulk it shows .
I do think there is mettle in death , which commits some loving act upon her , she hath such a celerity in dying .
Oh , ay , as summer flies are in the shambles , That quicken even with blowing .
Dead , then ?
When I come where he calls , then he is gone .
He that shall see this day , and live old age , Will yearly on the vigil feast his neighbors And say , "Tomorrow is Saint Crispian." Then will he strip his sleeve and show his scars , And say , "These wounds I had on Crispin's day."
O madam , madam , madam !
And in assemblies too .
I think their inhibition comes by the means of the late innovation .
Doth not the day break here ?
Say , is your tardy master now at hand ?
My love , my life , my soul , fair Helena !
Tis a day Such as the day is when the sun is hid .
We'll hear a play tomorrow .
I had thought t' have held it poor ; but since my lord Is Antony again , I will be Cleopatra .
I am much bound to you .
This prince hath neither claimed it nor deserved it And therefore , in mine opinion , can not have it .
Nay , he rubs himself with civet .
What ?
She shall not .
All that served Brutus , I will entertain them .
After a little time , I'll beat him too .
What cheer , my love ? , Demetrius and Egeus , go along .
Of a strange nature is the suit you follow , Yet in such rule that the Venetian law Can not impugn you as you do proceed. , Ay , so he says .
When you are gentle , you shall have one too , And not till then .
Crown him that , And then I grant we put a sting in him That at his will he may do danger with .
I dare not confess that lest I should compare with him in excellence , but to know a man well were to know himself .
What sayst thou ?
Believe me , King of Shadows , I mistook .
This is the fairy land .
Quickly let me have it .
What , is the fellow mad ?
Nay , good , be patient .
For the intent and purpose of the law Hath full relation to the penalty , Which here appeareth due upon the bond .
Look to the queen there , ho !
The messenger Came on my guard , and at thy tent is now Unloading of his mules .
We will go together .
Thou must not take my former sharpness ill .
I will weary you then no longer with idle talking .
A good moral , my lord : it is not enough to speak , but to speak true .
We will hence forthwith To feast and sport us at thy father's house .
And let her speak of me before her father .
Now welcome , Kate , and bear me witness all That here I kiss her as my sovereign queen .
O , thou well-skilled in curses , stay awhile , And teach me how to curse mine enemies .
You mean , to bear me , not to bear with me. , Uncle , my brother mocks both you and me .
I saw Othello's visage in his mind , And to his honors and his valiant parts Did I my soul and fortunes consecrate .
Art thou some god , some angel , or some devil That makest my blood cold and my hair to stare ?
My duty can not suffer To obey in all your daughters ' hard commands .
Tell me , and dally not : where is the money ?
A pestilent gall to me !
As I intend to prosper and repent , So thrive I in my dangerous affairs Of hostile arms !
Nay , not sure , in a thing falsing .
Never did faithful subject more rejoice At the discovery of most dangerous treason Than I do at this hour joy o'er myself , Prevented from a damned enterprise .
Ay , leeks is good .
Doing is activity , and he will still be doing .
Come one more .
Good sir , draw near to me .
Hath he provided this music ?
I was the more deceived .
From henceforth I will , coz , and devise sports .
And friends with Caesar .
The better for the King of heaven that hath him .
Tranio , let's go .
Dost thou understand me , man ?
Stoop , Romans , stoop , And let us bathe our hands in Caesar's blood Up to the elbows , and besmear our swords .
Question enrages him .
But no more sights ! , Where are these gentlemen ?
If thou consider rightly of the matter , Caesar has had great wrong .
Cowards die many times before their deaths .
And then , as we have ta'en the sacrament , We will unite the white rose and the red .
My lord ?
She lives .
Let me but meet you ladies one hour hence , And I'll salute your Grace of York as mother And reverend looker-on , of two fair queens .
And neither man nor master would take aught But the two rings .
He hath made me a Christian .
An there be any matter of weight chances , call up me .
Have you that holy feeling in your souls To counsel me to make my peace with God , And art you yet to your own souls so blind That thou will war with God by murd'ring me ?
Are your doors locked ?
Whilst he stood up and spoke , He was my master , and I wore my life To spend upon his haters .
If I do live , I will be good to thee .
Or shall I say her uncle ?
Fly , good Fleance , fly , fly , fly !
My sight was ever thick .
How comes that ?
When they shall see The face of Caesar , they are vanished .
Not sick , my lord , unless it be in mind , Nor well , unless in mind .
Sir , being his knave , I will .
Are you he ?
Why , and I trust I may go too , may I not ?
Of a snail ?
By heaven , I saw my handkerchief in 's hand .
If that her breath will mist or stain the stone , Why then , she lives .
My cousin means Signor Benedick of Padua .
And at her late being here She gave strange oeillades and most speaking looks To noble Edmund .
Have you writ down that they are none ?
Woe to the land that's governed by a child .
Exclaim no more against it .
If you will live , lament .
Now civil wounds are stopped , peace lives again .
He brings you figs .
Thou shouldst not have been old till thou hadst been wise .
No , as I am a Christian .
Hereafter , in a better world than this , I shall desire more love and knowledge of you .
So much for praising myself , who , I myself will bear witness , is praiseworthy .
That's her torment .
I say she never did invent this letter .
Though for myself alone I would not be ambitious in my wish To wish myself much better , yet for you I would be trebled twenty times myself , A thousand times more fair , ten thousand times more rich , That only to stand high in your account I might in virtue , beauties , livings , friends Exceed account .
Do what you will , dishonor shall be humor .
And when I told thee he was of my counsel Of my whole course of wooing , thou cried'st "Indeed ? " And didst contract and purse thy brow together As if thou then hadst shut up in thy brain Some horrible conceit .
I found it in my chamber , And he himself confessed but even now That there he dropped it for a special purpose Which wrought to his desire .
Thou seest that all the grace that she hath left Is that she will not add to her damnation A sin of perjury .
First let me talk with this philosopher. ,
Wouldst thou do such a deed for all the world ?
Three of the carriages , in faith , are very dear to fancy , very responsive to the hilts , most delicate carriages , and of very liberal conceit .
To Adriana , villain , hie thee straight .
Lysander's love , that would not let him bide , Fair Helena , who more engilds the night Than all yon fiery oes and eyes of light .
Ay , my good lord .
When they are in great danger , I recover them .
Of my kind uncle , that I know will give , And being but a toy , which is no grief to give .
Oh , let me see thee walk !
Where dost thou hide thy head ?
The king hath strictly charged the contrary .
Demetrius thinks not so .
Should I not say , "Hath a dog money ?
Tis good we do so .
Where be thy brothers ?
O ceremony , show me but thy worth !
Draw , you rogue , for though it be night yet the moon shines .
Wisdom !
O Cassius , Far from this country Pindarus shall run , Where never Roman shall take note of him .
Alas , my lord , Your wisdom is consumed in confidence .
My excellent good friends !
Then to have seen much and to have nothing is to have rich eyes and poor hands .
Antony , Leave thy lascivious wassails .
Patience , I pray you !
It is my birthday .
I shall obey you in all fair commands .
You are an ass , you are an ass !
What , are they children ?
Thou'st spoken right .
What profane wretch art thou ?
If he be , he knows how to turn his girdle .
Ay , but ( by your leave ) not before me .
Look , where he comes .
Is it no more but this , a tardiness in nature Which often leaves the history unspoke That it intends to do ? , My lord of Burgundy , What say you to the lady ?
I pray you , hear her speak .
So I hope .
Dar'st thou resolve to kill a friend of mine ?
I will , my lord .
March to the bridge .
Good sir , I do in friendship counsel you To leave this place .
One of my fellows had the speed of him , Who , almost dead for breath , had scarcely more Than would make up his message .
The king mine uncle is to blame for it .
To Adriana .
Caesar !
I know thee not .
This is some monster of the isle with four legs who hath got , as I take it , an ague .
These growing feathers plucked from Caesar's wing Will make him fly an ordinary pitch , Who else would soar above the view of men And keep us all in servile fearfulness .
I have too grieved a heart To take a tedious leave .
Good my lord , bid him welcome .
You have served me well , And kings have been your fellows .
I speak not like a dotard nor a fool , As under privilege of age to brag What I have done being young , or what would do Were I not old .
I never saw you in my life till now .
Make me not offended In your distrust .
Black night o'ershade thy day , and death thy life .
First , Pyramus must draw a sword to kill himself , which the ladies can not abide .
Oh , excellent !
No doubt , no doubt .
And wherefore doth Lysander Deny your love , so rich within his soul , And tender me , forsooth , affection , But by your setting on , by your consent ?
Answer my life my judgment , Thy youngest daughter does not love thee least , Nor are those empty-hearted whose low sound Reverbs no hollowness .
And this cuff was but to knock at your ear and beseech list'ning .
Experience , manhood , honor , ne'er before Did violate so itself .
The man that once did sell the lion's skin While the beast lived was killed with hunting him .
I think I did , sir .
Nine or ten times I had thought t ' have yerked him here under the ribs .
I pray you watch about Signior Leonato's door , for the wedding being there tomorrow , there is a great coil tonight .
Do not fear our person .
Our friends all stay for you .
This was a merry message .
It is so .
Me , poor man , my library Was dukedom large enough .
You'll have coursers for cousins and gennets for germans .
Your Majesty came not like yourself .
And stand indebted , over and above , In love and service to you evermore .
William , sir .
Do not , my lord .
What's his offense ?
Lead me .
Take in your love , and then let me alone .
How easy is it , then !
It is but change , Titinius , for Octavius Is overthrown by noble Brutus ' power , As Cassius ' legions are by Antony .
Besides , they are our outward consciences And preachers to us all , admonishing That we should dress us fairly for our end .
And how like you this shepherd's life , Master Touchstone ?
What think'st thou then of Stanley ?
And it is marvel he outdwells his hour , For lovers ever run before the clock .
Lead , monster ; we'll follow .
Well , may you see things well done there .
I am an ass , I am a woman's man , and besides myself .
Sirs , let 't alone .
That head , my lord ?
Good morrow , Richmond .
Oh , what authority and show of truth Can cunning sin cover itself withal !
Husband , I'll dine above with you today , And shrive you of a thousand idle pranks .
I heard thee say even now thou lik'st not that When Cassio left my wife .
Perchance till after Theseus ' wedding day .
Here is my bed .
Here it is .
Good night , but go not to mine uncle's bed .
Gave it a judge's clerk !
Keep your cabins .
If he , compact of jars , grow musical , We shall have shortly discord in the spheres .
These deeds must not be thought After these ways .
Where remains he ?
I say , we will have no more marriages .
Why , that was he .
If any bark put forth , come to the mart , Where I will walk till thou return to me .
For my brother , I think he holds you well , and in dearness of heart hath holp to effect your ensuing marriage , surely suit ill spent and labor ill bestowed .
But all remember What you have said , and show yourselves true Romans .
But do not so .
I prithee , hear me speak .
If you dare fight today , come to the field .
How do you , sir ?
Both , both , my lord. , This letter , madam , craves a speedy answer .
You're welcome , sir , and he for your good sake .
If he distaste it , let him to our sister , Whose mind and mine I know in that are one , Not to be overruled .
All ready .
If I should speak , She would mock me into air .
What services canst thou do ?
If her breath were as terrible as her terminations , there were no living near her ; she would infect to the north star .
Iago ?
Come , sister. , Shepherdess , look on him better , And be not proud .
Then there is no true lover in the forest , else sighing every minute and groaning every hour would detect the lazy foot of time as well as a clock .
What have you , my good friends , deserved at the hands of fortune that she sends you to prison hither ?
Caesar , thy thoughts Touch their effects in this .
In great measure .
This , this All Souls ' Day to my fearful soul Is the determined respite of my wrongs .
Sir , I will answer any thing .
If she be in her chamber or your house , Let loose on me the justice of the state For thus deluding you .
Come , Hamlet , come , and take this hand from me .
Nay , he reserved a blanket , else we had been all shamed .
Why , she comes to borrow nothing of them .
But I'll see you soon .
Now , fellows , you are welcome .
And so far blameless proves my enterprise , That I have 'nointed an Athenian's eyes .
Here , sweet lord , at your service .
Cast on no water .
Then forth , dear countrymen .
Ay , my good lord .
Is he not able to discharge the money ?
If we do meet again , why , we shall smile .
I pray thee , sing , and let me woo no more .
Oh , a cherubim Thou wast that did preserve me .
That skull had a tongue in it and could sing once .
Come , where's the chain ?
Disorder , that hath spoiled us , friend us now .
You know that you are Brutus that speak this , Or , by the gods , this speech were else your last .
Can virtue hide itself ?
Good my liege , Peace , Kent .
Here we .
Every subject's duty is the king's , but every subject's soul is his own .
Ay , indeed !
Some good man bear him carefully from hence .
They sit conferring by the parlor fire .
I think it is .
Is all things ready for the royal time ?
Your royal father's murdered .
Oh , Caesar , This Charmian lived but now .
Tears seven times salt , Burn out the sense and virtue of mine eye !
Arise , dissembler .
O , touch me not .
Ay , or very falsely pocket up his report .
Then , at my farm I have a hundred milch-kine to the pail , Six score fat oxen standing in my stalls , And all things answerable to this portion .
He has a little galled me , I confess .
What Conrade !
Den it sall also content me .
Saw who ?
O , 'tis a parlous boy , Bold , quick , ingenious , forward , capable .
It may be , these apparent prodigies , The unaccustomed terror of this night , And the persuasion of his augurers May hold him from the Capitol today .
He can not flatter , he .
The duke must grant me that .
I did not think you could have been so angry .
Why , I pray you , is not "pig" great ?
For certain , sir , he is not .
No , sir , 'tis in grain ; Noah's flood could not do it .
Yet Count Claudio may hear , for what I would speak of concerns him .
But if all aim but this be leveled false , The supposition of the lady's death Will quench the wonder of her infamy .
These both put off , a poor petitioner , A care-crazed mother to a many sons , A beauty-waning and distressed widow , Even in the afternoon of her best days , Made prize and purchase of his wanton eye , Seduced the pitch and height of his degree To base declension and loathed bigamy .
How say you , Signior Gremio ?
We will behold his death .
The messengers of Venice stays the meat .
I am a soldier , I , Older in practice , abler than yourself To make conditions .
Shall we sound him ?
So is mine. , Do you hear , monster ?
If he be not in love with some woman , there is no believing old signs .
Whose hand soever launched their tender hearts , Thy head , all indirectly , gave direction .
Silence !
I will not hear thee speak .
It was he That made the overture of thy treasons to us , Who is too good to pity thee .
But of that tomorrow , When therewithal we shall have cause of state Craving us jointly .
How is 't with you ?
As good a gentleman as the emperor .
Follow , and see there be no harm between them .
Presently ?
A quarrel , ho , already ?
I know a lady in Venice would have walked barefoot to Palestine for a touch of his nether lip .
But I have spoke With one that saw him die , who did report That very frankly he confessed his treasons , Implored your highness ' pardon , and set forth A deep repentance .
Nature wants stuff To vie strange forms with fancy , yet t' imagine An Antony were nature's piece 'gainst fancy , Condemning shadows quite .
How does my wife ?
What noise is that ?
He did , and from my finger snatched that ring .
Lend me thy cloak , Sir Thomas .
Sister , content you in my discontent. , Sir , to your pleasure humbly I subscribe .
As wit and fortune will .
Relent ?
My sweet mistress Weeps when she sees me work , and says such baseness Had never like executor .
Well said , old mole !
She swoons to see them bleed .
Well , to our work alive .
The dearest ring in Venice will I give you , And find it out by proclamation .
At least I'm sure it may be so in Denmark .
Exceedingly , my lord .
Your Grace , we think , should soonest know his mind .
Faith , there has been much to do on both sides , and the nation holds it no sin to tar them to controversy .
I see the ruin of my house .
Utter my thoughts ?
It was a vision fair and fortunate .
What committed ?
In the name lay A moiety of the world .
The time of universal peace is near .
O , let us have him , for his silver hairs Will purchase us a good opinion And buy men's voices to commend our deeds .
There was a pretty redness in his lip , A little riper and more lusty red Than that mixed in his cheek : 'twas just the difference Betwixt the constant red and mingled damask .
He says for Brutus ' sake He finds himself beholding to us all .
I never did like molestation view On the enchafed flood .
Sweet , say on .
O Antony , beg not your death of us .
Old Cassius still .
And , moreover , God saw him when he was hid in the garden .
I am glad on 't .
Let me hire him too. , Here's my coxcomb .
We have not yet set down this day of triumph .
Let's stay and hear the will .
No , truly , for the truest poetry is the most feigning , and lovers are given to poetry , and what they swear in poetry may be said as lovers they do feign .
That's as much as to say they are fools that marry .
He attends here in the forest on the duke your father .
How does thy honor ?
He is then a giant to an ape ; but then is an ape a doctor to such a man .
He's dead .
Seest thou this sweet sight ?
Good morrow to you both .
Are you of good or evil ?
In the meantime , let me be that I am , and seek not to alter me .
No more !
Alack , our terrene moon is now eclipsed , And it portends alone the fall of Antony .
Come , go along .
Well , more anon. , Comes the king forth , I pray you ?
And now to our French causes .
Fall and cease .
What , master , read you ?
Marry , I fare well , For here is cheer enough .
You must think this , look you , that the worm will do his kind .
Cousin , you apprehend passing shrewdly .
Then will two at once woo one .
Good my friends , consider You are my guests .
As he shall smile , Othello shall go mad .
Octavia weeps To part from Rome .
Where is kind Hastings ?
I think he brings the money .
Fear not , Baptista , we will content you .
If she confess that she was half the wooer , Destruction on my head if my bad blame Light on the man. , Come hither , gentle mistress .
O Thou , whose captain I account myself , Look on my forces with a gracious eye .
I'll put myself in poor and mean attire And with a kind of umber smirch my face .
Now , if you love me , stay .
Enobarbus , welcome .
I was the man i ' the moon when time was .
It is a wise father that knows his own child .
Where is thy power , then , to beat him back ?
You're much deceived .
Yet this I will not do , do how I can .
The queen , my lord , is dead .
Not in this land shall he remain uncaught .
If I were Brutus now and he were Cassius , He should not humor me .
Not possible .
That's not so good now .
Yea , marry , let them come before me .
With her , on her , what you will .
Let's hear it .
By heaven , I do not , I do not , gentlemen. , O murderous coxcomb !
I am very glad to see you , signior .
Farewell , for I must leave you .
Moreover , urge his hateful luxury And bestial appetite in change of lust , Which stretched to their servants , daughters , wives , Even where his raging eye or savage heart , Without control , lusted to make his prey .
And take good note What Caesar doth , what suitors press to him .
Beatrice , In faith , I will go .
There's something else to do .
Renowned duke , vouchsafe to take the pains To go with us into the abbey here And hear at large discoursed all our fortunes , And all that are assembled in this place That by this sympathized one day's error Have suffered wrong .
He is much changed .
Thou rascal beadle , hold thy bloody hand .
Look , sir , I bleed .
Why , that's spoken like an honest drover ; so they sell bullocks .
Good madam .
Thou , it seems , that calls for company to countenance her .
Farewell , dear mother .
Buzz , buzz .
We please them not by land .
I say again , give out That Anne my queen is sick and like to die .
Yet here she is allowed her virgin crants , Her maiden strewments , and the bringing home Of bell and burial .
She had a prophesying fear Of what hath come to pass .
And what your Highness suffered under that shape , I beseech you take it for your own fault and not mine , for , had you been as I took you for , I made no offense .
Still be kind And eke out our performance with your mind .
But yesterday the word of Caesar might Have stood against the world .
When , without stratagem , But in plain shock and even play of battle , Was ever known so great and little loss On one part and on th ' other ?
Oh that I knew this husband , which , you say , must charge his horns with garlands !
My good friends , I'll leave you till night .
What , sigh for the toothache ?
Which is that adversary ?
Our house is hell , and thou , a merry devil , Didst rob it of some taste of tediousness .
Have at you with a proverb : shall I set in my staff ?
Fortune is an excellent moral .
What have you done , my lord , with the dead body ?
Hold , take thou that and that .
The potent poison quite o'ercrows my spirit .
O my good master !
Oh , she will sing the savageness out of a bear !
Shall I speak a word in your ear ?
Worthy Othello , I am hurt to danger .
Did this in Caesar seem ambitious ?
Marry , this is miching
And that's but unwholesome food , they say .
What though I be not so in grace as you , So hung upon with love , so fortunate , But miserable most , to love unloved ?
Go to , they are not men o ' their words .
So did I too , and he swore he would marry her tonight .
Let us hear , sweet Bottom .
Nay , I have offered all , I have no more , And she can have no more than all I have .
What dost thou say ?
Go fetch fire .
You are very sensible , and yet you miss my sense : I mean , Hortensio is afeard of you .
Why , he shall never wake until the great Judgment Day .
Brother , good night .
And be all traitors that do so ?
Then , you conclude , my grandam , he is dead .
Judge me the world if 'tis not gross in sense That thou hast practiced on her with foul charms , Abused her delicate youth with drugs or minerals That weakens motion .
My lord , my lord !
Ay , marry , are they , sir .
How now , old lad ?
For he loves to hear That unicorns may be betrayed with trees , And bears with glasses , elephants with holes , Lions with toils , and men with flatterers .
You shall try but one fall .
Am not I Christopher Sly , old Sly's son of Burton Heath , by birth a peddler , by education a cardmaker , by transmutation a bearherd , and now by present profession a tinker ?
Brutus , bait not me .
He hath done good service , lady , in these wars .
What , is he dead ?
I hold your dainties cheap , sir , and your welcome dear .
Mine eyes did sicken at the sight and could not Endure a further view .
Haply I see a friend will save my life And pay the sum that may deliver me .
O , do not do your cousin such a wrong !
Here was he merry , hearing of a song .
Y'are a baggage , the Slys are no rogues .
Your It is not a fashion for the maids in France to kiss before they are married , would she say ?
Go , Biondello , bid your mistress come to me .
What , is he dead ?
We must incline to the king .
Why then , 'tis good to be a post .
What art thou that keep'st me out from the house I owe ?
I go .
Desire him to go in .
Good Grumio , fetch it me .
This is the night That either makes me or fordoes me quite .
Thou baggage , let me in .
Where is my lady ?
I can not tell what you and other men Think of this life , but , for my single self , I had as lief not be as live to be In awe of such a thing as I myself .
Thy conceit is nearer death than thy powers .
I had rather to adopt a child than get it. , Come hither , Moor .
Dromio , what stuff of mine hast thou embarked ?
The thrice three Muses mourning for the death Of learning , late deceased in beggary." That is some satire , keen and critical , Not sorting with a nuptial ceremony .
I hope she will be brief .
Ratcliffe , my lord , 'tis I .
Detain no jot , I charge thee .
What is your will , sir , that you send for me ?
I must remove Some thousands of these logs and pile them up , Upon a sore injunction .
You wrong me , Signior Gremio .
What news , my lord ?
Strike !
Good friend , go to him .
I ' faith , I thank him .
Bassanio told him he would make some speed Of his return .
Madam , I trust , not so .
Tell the constable .
Come , brother ; away !
Well , Syracusian , say in brief the cause Why thou dep-artedst from thy native home And for what cause thou camest to Ephesus .
Not see him since ?
I will .
I had rather have this tongue cut from my mouth Than it should do offence to Michael Cassio .
Pardon , my lord .
Come , my sweet Kate .
I'll die for 't but some woman had the ring .
The king is mad .
If not , when you have stomachs .
No , he doth but mistake the truth totally .
Go to the pulpit , Brutus .
Look , they weep , And I , an ass , am onion-eyed .
Perchance ?
All is not well .
But this most foul , strange and unnatural .
Plucks off my beard and blows it in my face ?
I am a gentleman , sir , and my name is Conrade .
His letter there Will show you his estate .
They could not , would not do 't .
I do serve you in this business .
Oh , beware , my lord , of jealousy !
Woe that too late repents ! , Is it your will ?
Well then , now Have you considered of my speeches ?
I prithee , Remember I have done thee worthy service , Told thee no lies , made thee no mistakings , served Without or grudge or grumblings .
Would that he were gone !
We know thy charge , Brakenbury , and will obey .
The king is not bound to answer the particular endings of his soldiers , the father of his son , nor the master of his servant , for they purpose not their death , when they purpose their services .
I beseech you , sir , pardon me .
Signor Antonio Commends him to you .
I do wander everywhere Swifter than the moon's sphere .
This Caesar was a tyrant .
Nay , when I have a suit Wherein I mean to touch your love indeed It shall be full of poise and difficult weight And fearful to be granted .
God be wi ' you and keep you and heal your pate .
Come , go with me apart .
He shall spurn fate , scorn death , and bear His hopes 'bove wisdom , grace , and fear .
Ay , sir , I have a pretty wit .
Belike some noble gentleman that means , Traveling some journey , to repose him here .
Thrice hath Calphurnia in her sleep cried out , "Help , ho !
But , sir , be you ruled by me .
Caesar , thou canst not die by traitors ' hands Unless thou bring'st them with thee .
At a word , I am not .
Prithee , away .
Malcolm and Donalbain , the king's two sons , Are stol'n away and fled , which puts upon them Suspicion of the deed .
These words are not mine .
Oh , now forever Farewell the tranquil mind !
There's Dolabella sent from Caesar .
O damned Iago !
Who calls ?
My brave spirit !
Orlando , my liege , the youngest son of Sir Rowland de Boys .
For taking one's part that's out of favor .
If we , with thrice such powers left at home , Can not defend our own doors from the dog , Let us be worried , and our nation lose The name of hardiness and policy .
Behold , sir .
I remember You did supplant your brother Prospero .
O my brave Emperor , this is fought indeed !
These fellows have some soul ,
What , go you toward the Tower ?
I'll not endure it .
Come , come , away .
Happily , amen !
There's knocking at the gate .
There would this monster make a man .
Advantage is a better soldier than rashness .
Think not , thou noble Roman , That ever Brutus will go bound to Rome .
I will be correspondent to command And do my spiriting gently .
Dolor comes to him , indeed .
Therefore play , music. , Prince , thou art sad .
Why , here begins his morning story right ; These two Antipholuses , these two so like , And these two Dromios , one in semblance , Besides her urging of her wreck at sea , These are the parents to these children , Which accidentally are met together .
As I descended ?
Let your wedding be tomorrow .
Nor doth this wood lack worlds of company , For you in my respect are all the world .
And these few precepts in thy memory Look thou character .
Please you , draw near. , Louder the music there !
Why , you speak truth .
Fie , for shame !
This is the very ecstasy of love , Whose violent property fordoes itself And leads the will to desperate undertakings As oft as any passion under heaven That does afflict our natures .
I will not say you shall see a masque , but if you do then it was not for nothing that my nose fell a-bleeding on Black Monday last at six o'clock i ' th ' morning falling out that year on Ash Wednesday was four year in th ' afternoon .
My ships come home a month before the day .
There's but one down .
Be it so , Lysander .
When the mind's free , The body's delicate .
To 't , luxury , pell-mell , for I lack soldiers .
Why , then let's home again .
Why , what should you fear ?
Here therefore for a while I will remain .
I have forgot your name , but sure that part Was aptly fitted and naturally performed .
Oh , devil , devil !
And while thou liv'st , dear Kate , take a fellow of plain and uncoined constancy , for he perforce must do thee right because he hath not the gift to woo in other places .
Yea , my lord , but I can cross it .
No , good mother .
For by the way I'll sort occasion , As index to the story we late talked of , To part the queen's proud kindred from the prince .
If thou rememberest aught ere thou camest here , How thou camest here thou mayst .
Why , thou didst conclude hairy men plain dealers without wit .
If I had a thunderbolt in mine eye , I can tell who should down .
No , truly , unless thou wert hard-favored , for honesty coupled to beauty is to have honey a sauce to sugar .
Our present business Is to general woe .
The glowworm shows the matin to be near , And 'gins to pale his uneffectual fire .
Why , what a monstrous fellow art thou , thus to rail on one that is neither known of thee nor knows thee !
Read the will .
I do beseech you , Chiefly that I might set it in my prayers , What is your name ?
O Sisters three , Come , come to me With hands as pale as milk .
Will you , I pray , demand that demi-devil Why he hath thus ensnared my soul and body ?
Think'st thou , Hortensio , though her father be very rich , any man is so very a fool to be married to hell ?
Sure we thank you .
Is it they ?
And out of doubt you do me now more wrong In making question of my uttermost Than if you had made waste of all I have .
Shall I descend ?
I have seen you gleeking and galling at this gentleman twice or thrice .
Did your letters pierce the queen to any demonstration of grief ?
Persuade me rather to be slave and sumpter To this detested groom .
Heaven keep the monster from Othello's mind !
Do you doubt that ?
Then wherefore should I doubt ?
All that is spoke is marred .
Are you crept hither to see the wrestling ?
You must leave this .
Well .
If you did wed my sister for her wealth , Then for her wealth's sake use her with more kindness .
Kind gentlemen , your pains Are registered where every day I turn The leaf to read them .
One inch of delay more is a South Sea of discovery .
With who ?
Had I as many mouths as Hydra , such an answer would stop them all .
This mortal house I'll ruin , Do Caesar what he can .
You must call forth the watch that are their accusers .
Must I bite ?
Ay , and a bold one , that dare look on that Which might appall the devil .
When I am known aright you shall not grieve Lending me this acquaintance .
Take thee that too .
I shall never see my gold again .
But what talk we of fathers when there is such a man as Orlando ?
We looked not for Mark Antony here .
I know his heart .
Your royal preparation Makes us hear something .
You would say so , master , if your garments were thin .
Ay , on the front .
For , since the mortal and intestine jars 'Twixt thy seditious countrymen and us , It hath in solemn synods been decreed Both by the Syracusians and ourselves , To admit no traffic to our adverse towns .
When I like your favor , for God defend the lute should be like the case !
Stay yet .
Did Michael Cassio , when you wooed my lady , Know of your love ?
I warrant you , madam .
Demand .
Prithee , dispatch .
I'll apprehend him .
Well , be it so .
I thank thee for thy care and honest pains .
Is not , sir , my doublet as fresh as the first day I wore it ?
You dare easier be friends with me than fight with mine enemy .
With whom ?
Hie you , Messala , And I will seek for Pindarus the while .
No , that same wicked bastard of Venus that was begot of thought , conceived of spleen , and born of madness , that blind rascally boy that abuses everyone's eyes because his own are out , let him be judge how deep I am in love .
Again !
Both wind and tide stays for this gentleman , And I , to blame , have held him here too long .
You're welcome hither .
So doth the greater glory dim the less .
Ay , master .
Good your grace , pardon me .
I heard nothing .
Oh , 'tis foul in her .
As manhood shall compound .
Wherefore did they not That hour destroy us ?
The capon burns ; the pig falls from the spit ; The clock hath strucken twelve upon the bell ; My mistress made it one upon my cheek .
For our bad neighbor makes us early stirrers , Which is both healthful and good husbandry .
For the best turn i' th' bed .
I say my prayers aloud .
My precious Queen , forbear , And give true evidence to his love which stands An honorable trial .
Sure , I shall never marry like my sisters , To love my father all .
Sirrah , I'll teach thee a speech .
Mistress , we have .
Pray ye , sir ?
Tell me , thou villain-slave , where are my children ?
My mistress showed me thee and thy dog and thy bush .
Knock at the gate ?
I did so , and went further , which is now Our point of second meeting .
Why , sweet Othello , I have not deserved this .
Fear it , Ophelia .
You are my true and honorable wife , As dear to me as are the ruddy drops That visit my sad heart .
If I do die before thee , prithee , shroud me In one of these same sheets .
A good matter , surely .
Who chooseth me shall get as much as he deserves." "As much as he deserves ! " , pause there , Morocco , And weigh thy value with an even hand .
I hope you will consider what is spoke Comes from my love .
Sue to him again and he's yours .
Sleep thou , and I will wind thee in my arms .
I will set down what comes from her , to satisfy my remembrance the more strongly .
Speak , speak .
The god of Jupiter .
O , my fair cousin , I must not say so .
I did not give the lie .
I'll fetch some flax and whites of eggs To apply to his bleeding face .
Zounds , I'll entreat no more .
There lies your love .
Yet you , the murderer , look as bright , as clear , As yonder Venus in her glimmering sphere .
But did'st thou see them dead ?
Certain ones , then .
If there be more , more woeful , hold it in .
Help , help , O , help !
I would have none but knaves follow it since a fool gives it .
Fare thee well at once .
Methinks they are such a gentle nation that , but for the mountain of mad flesh
Caesar sits down in Alexandria , where I will oppose his fate .
I did not kill your husband .
Pleasure and action make the hours seem short .
Will he tell us what this show meant ?
If we do lose this battle , then is this The very last time we shall speak together .
Well , my good fellows , wait on me tonight .
He hath fought today As if a god , in hate of mankind , had Destroyed in such a shape .
Thou liest , thou thread , thou thimble , Thou yard , three-quarters , half-yard , quarter , nail !
Hum !
On what occasion God He knows , not I , The queen your mother and your brother York Have taken sanctuary .
And when she is froward , peevish , sullen , sour , And not obedient to his honest will , What is she but a foul contending rebel And graceless traitor to her loving lord ?
And true she is , as she hath proved herself .
Shall I have the thought To think on this , and shall I lack the thought That such a thing bechanced would make me sad ?
He is of a very melancholy disposition .
I can not tell .
And though you know my inwardness and love Is very much unto the Prince and Claudio , Yet , by mine honor , I will deal in this As secretly and justly as your soul Should with your body .
Baptista is a noble gentleman , To whom my father is not all unknown , And were his daughter fairer than she is , She may more suitors have , and me for one .
Do not weep , do not weep .
The Lord Mayor knocks .
And I am your Rosalind .
Tis clean out of the way .
No grave upon the earth shall clip in it A pair so famous .
There were none principal .
I do not like your faults .
I see , sir , you have found the goldsmith now .
And thither will I straight to visit him .
Gloucester's eyes ?
Goes the king hence today ?
Is it not Hero ?
Good morrow , Casca. , Caius Ligarius , Caesar was ne'er so much your enemy As that same ague which hath made you lean .
Let us to the great supper .
And mine , to eke out hers .
Soft and fair , Friar. , Which is Beatrice ?
Hail , King of Scotland !
Do not lie so near .
Your servant shall do so .
Coming from Sardis , on our former ensign Two mighty eagles fell , and there they perched , Gorging and feeding from our soldiers ' hands , Who to Philippi here consorted us .
What ish my nation ?
I warrant you , you shall find the ceremonies of the wars and the cares of it and the forms of it and the sobriety of it and the modesty of it to be otherwise .
Kind sister , thanks .
What else , fellow ?
Do you not jest ?
Marry , sir , we say we are none .
Let good Antonio look he keep his day , Or he shall pay for this .
We love him highly And shall continue our graces towards him .
Take you , as 'twere , some distant knowledge of him , As thus : "I know his father and his friends , And , in part , him." Do you mark this , Reynaldo ?
Come .
What shall we do , Enobarbus ?
Naught that I am , Not for their own demerits , but for mine , Fell slaughter on their souls .
Indeed she's a most fresh and delicate creature .
When you have spoken your speech , enter into that brake. , And so everyone according to his cue .
I humbly thank you for't .
For I have seen more years , I'm sure , than ye .
What's your name ?
Hear the ambassadors .
Will it never be morning ?
I warrant you .
What mar you then , sir ?
O my Christian ducats !
Fare you well .
What are these faces ?
Fare you well .
Thy grace shall have it .
Will you to Scone ?
Marry , that he had received a thousand ducats of Don John for accusing the Lady Hero wrongfully .
When I do name him , let it be thy part To praise him more than ever man did merit .
I have seen nothing .
I can tell what thou wouldst do .
What , with my tongue in your tail ?
Will your grace command me any service to the world's end ?
Tis pitiful , but yet Iago knows That she with Cassio hath the act of shame A thousand times committed .
Antony will use his affection where it is .
The less they deserve , the more merit is in your bounty .
O dear discretion , how his words are suited !
I was killed i ' th ' Capitol .
I humbly take my leave .
How comes it now , my husband , O , how comes it That thou art thus estranged from thyself ?
You look angerly .
Who brought it ?
God and your arms be praised , victorious friends !
Tis almost fairy time .
My being in Egypt , Caesar , what was 't to you ?
Dost thou think Alexander looked o ' this fashion i ' th ' earth ?
Here's packing , with a witness , to deceive us all !
Truly , sir , to wear out their shoes to get myself into more work .
Three thousand ducats , well .
I must attend the duke at dinner .
But what see I ?
He is not lolling on a lewd love bed , But on his knees at meditation ; Not dallying with a brace of courtesans , But meditating with two deep divines ; Not sleeping , to engross his idle body , But praying , to enrich his watchful soul .
He comes , my lord .
I have not breathed almost since I did see it .
We see how mortal an unkindness is to them .
Be not offended .
No , forbear .
But I pray you , who is his companion ?
Come down .
How goes it now ?
If thou ask me why , sufficeth my reasons are both good and weighty .
You slave , you cur !
He hath assembled Bocchus , the King of Libya ; Archelaus , Of Cappadocia ; Philadelphos , King Of Paphlagonia ; the Thracian king , Adallas ; King Manchus of Arabia ; King of Pont ; Herod of Jewry ; Mithridates , King Of Comagen ; Polemon and Amyntas , The Kings of Mede and Lycaonia , With a more larger list of scepters .
My talk to thee must be how Benedick Is sick in love with Beatrice .
Is it answered ?
You shall see anon how the murderer gets the love of Gonzago's wife .
Ha , ha , ha !
My affections Are then most humble .
There is one within , Besides the things that we have heard and seen , Recounts most horrid sights seen by the watch .
I am glad on 't .
Nod to him , elves , and do him courtesies .
Well then , it now appears you need my help .
For what is he they follow ?
O Pomfret , Pomfret !
The quality of mercy is not strained .
Not for the wide world .
There's husbandry in heaven ; Their candles are all out .
Draw together .
But now I was the lord Of this fair mansion , master of my servants , Queen o'er myself .
Richard except , those whom we fight against Had rather have us win than him they follow .
Then plainly to her tell my loving tale .
Since thou dost give me pains , Let me remember thee what thou hast promised , Which is not yet performed me .
Tis destiny unshunnable , like death .
Well met , honest gentleman .
And this way have you well expounded it .
Come , shall we hear this music ?
Courage .
Oh , pardon me , Signior Gremio , I would fain be doing .
But since he stands obdurate And that no lawful means can carry me Out of his envy's reach , I do oppose My patience to his fury , and am armed To suffer with a quietness of spirit The very tyranny and rage of his .
Thou dar'st as well be hanged .
Tomorrow shall you bear our full intent Back to our brother England .
Did he not rather Discredit my authority with yours , And make the wars alike against my stomach , Having alike your cause ?
Master , go on , and I will follow thee To the last gasp , with truth and loyalty .
Where's my knave , my fool ? , Go you , and call my fool hither .
Ay , but the mustard is too hot a little .
Thou dost belie her , and thou art a devil .
This lanthorn doth the horned moon present .
He is not yet arrived .
We have engaged ourselves too far .
Men shall deal unadvisedly sometimes , Which after-hours give leisure to repent .
How dost thou and thy master agree ?
I pray you do .
Ay , there's the villany .
Go , keep us company , And we shall make full satisfaction. , Thirty-three years have I but gone in travail Of you , my sons , and till this present hour My heavy burden ne'er delivered. , The Duke , my husband , and my children both , And you , the calendars of their nativity , Go to a gossips ' feast , and go with me .
Eros , thou yet behold'st me ?
Wife , children , servants , all that could be found .
He were a brave monster indeed , if they were set in his tail .
Why wither not the leaves that want their sap ?
Hear a little further And then I'll bring thee to the present business Which now 's upon 's , without the which this story Were most impertinent .
Bear'st thou her face in mind ?
Teach me , dear creature , how to think and speak .
For the meat , sir , it shall be covered .
And I have met a gentleman Hath promised me to help me to another , A fine musician to instruct our mistress .
There are no tricks in plain and simple faith .
Say , Voltemand , what from our brother Norway ?
Who is so gross That can not see this palpable device ?
Do we so .
Come to me , Tyrrel , soon at after-supper , When thou shalt tell the process of their death .
Read it instantly .
Oh , do but think You stand upon the rivage and behold A city on th ' inconstant billows dancing , For so appears this fleet majestical Holding due course to Harfleur .
Speak softly .
Things base and vile , holding no quantity , Love can transpose to form and dignity .
What rein can hold licentious wickedness When down the hill he holds his fierce career ?
But thus , I trust , you will not marry her .
I warrant something from Venice .
No marvel then , though he were ill affected .
Horn mad , thou villain !
Tut , I am in their bosoms , and I know Wherefore they do it .
And so in me , and so , I think , in all .
And when she speaks , is it not an alarum to love ?
Spake you of Caesar ?
Your loss is as yourself , great , and you bear it As answering to the weight .
Even so .
Turn thy complexion there , Patience , thou young and rose-lipped cherubin , , Ay , there , look grim as hell !
Show 's the way , sir .
Besides , our hands are hard .
Trust not to rotten planks .
Out of my sight !
Zounds , he dies !
But if thou diest before I come , thou art a mocker of my labor .
Tis like the howling of Irish wolves against the moon .
I know this is a joyful trouble to you , But yet 'tis one .
Godspeed , fair Helena !
Yea , and I will weep a while longer .
This is the fruits of rashness .
In God's name , speak .
Here comes another of the tribe .
I must attend on Caesar .
Question it , Horatio .
Well , thou dost best .
Which be the malefactors ?
I loved you not .
I do beseech your Grace pardon me , Who , earnest in the service of my God , Deferred the visitation of my friends .
No .
And so swear I .
Do you mark that , my lord ?
Why had I one ?
What , shall I find you here ?
This , and Saint George to boot , What think'st thou , Norfolk ?
Where is he ?
And by how much she strives to do him good She shall undo her credit with the Moor .
We will haste us .
Though that the queen on special cause is here , Her army is moved on .
How can it be ?
Why ,
Passion , I see , is catching , for mine eyes , Seeing those beads of sorrow stand in thine , Began to water .
So are those crisped snaky golden locks Which maketh such wanton gambols with the wind , Upon supposed fairness , often known To be the dowry of a second head , The skull that bred them in the sepulcher .
When it is paid , bring your true friend along .
Even since you left it .
Never fear that .
True , madam .
Thou art a fool .
You were sent for , and there is a kind of confession in your looks which your modesties have not craft enough to color .
O Caesar , read mine first , for mine's a suit That touches Caesar nearer .
Because my name is George .
I have brought you from Venice .
Hark , they roar .
Robin Starveling , the tailor ?
And he's gone .
Sword" is an oath , and oaths must have their course .
Why , he drinks you with facility your Dane dead drunk ; he sweats not to overthrow your Almain .
His Honor and myself are at the one , And at the other is my good friend Catesby , Where nothing can proceed that toucheth us Whereof I shall not have intelligence .
Though their injunction be to bar my doors And let this tyrannous night take hold upon you , Yet have I ventured to come seek you out And bring you where both fire and food is ready .
Women are made to bear , and so are you .
Here is the man .
Well then , if ever I thank any man , I'll thank you .
Wrong I mine enemies ?
But , soft !
What , must our mouths be cold ?
Katherine his daughter and with her , to dowry , Some petty and unprofitable dukedoms .
This is the door .
My lord , I will use them according to their desert .
The Lord protect him from that kingly title !
Come on and kiss me , Kate .
To Brutus ' , to Cassius ' , burn all .
How does the queen ?
Eight wild boars roasted whole at a breakfast , and but twelve persons there !
Is not the leaf turned down Where I left reading ?
Lo , now , lo !
Why ask you this ?
Help , ho !
What says my lord ?
Madam , withdraw : the Prince , the Count , Signor Benedick , Don John , and all the gallants of the town are come to fetch you to church .
Unaccommodated man is no more but such a poor , bare , forked animal as thou art. , Off , off , you lendings !
I thank thee , Ariel .
Bless thee from whirlwinds , star-blasting , and taking !
To express the like kindness , myself , that have been more kindly beholding to you than any , freely give unto you this young scholar
He is a gentleman of a good house , and for his ransom he will give you two hundred crowns .
Lend thine ear .
By no means , sir .
Our power is ready ; Our lack is nothing but our leave .
The red plague rid you For learning me your language !
Home , you idle creatures get you home !
The gain I seek is quiet in the match .
Caesar is touched .
I will play the swan .
Filth , thou liest !
He said mine eyes were black and my hair black And , now I am remembered , scorned at me .
Her mother hath many times told me so .
Send for the man and ask him .
The sister to my wife , this gentlewoman , Thy son by this hath married .
I will requite your loves .
Hush and be mute , Or else our spell is marred .
Come , Grey .
Virtue ?
Never alone Did the king sigh , but with a general groan .
She robs thee of thy name , And thou wilt show more bright and seem more virtuous When she is gone .
What's here ?
I will watch tonight .
See , who comes here ?
But it is no matter .
No , Kate ?
Thou hast a sister by the mother's side , Admired Octavia .
Egypt , thou knew'st too well My heart was to thy rudder tied by th' strings , And thou shouldst tow me after .
The words expressly are "a pound of flesh." Take then thy bond , take thou thy pound of flesh , But in the cutting it if thou dost shed One drop of Christian blood , thy lands and goods Are by the laws of Venice confiscate Unto the state of Venice .
We speak no treason , man .
Ay , sooth , so humbled That he hath left part of his grief with me To suffer with him .
O wonderful son that can so 'stonish a mother !
Tis certain , every man that dies ill , the ill upon his own head .
Follow me .
Yet his means are in supposition .
Captain Jamy is a marvelous falorous gentleman , that is certain , and of great expedition and knowledge in th ' aunchient wars , upon my particular knowledge of his directions .
Why , now , blow wind , swell billow , and swim bark !
Half-blooded fellow , yes .
No more of that .
And I for no woman .
Then there's life in 't .
But how hath she received his love ?
To who ?
Marry , heaven forbid !
Do you sing it , and I'll dance it .
The Duke does greet you , general , And he requires your haste-post-haste appearance , Even on the instant .
I afeard of him !
You have told me she hath received them and returned me expectations and comforts of sudden respect and acquaintance , but I find none .
The like is on her arm .
Indeed , indeed , sirs , but this troubles me .
We have consented to all terms of reason .
But are my brother's powers set forth ?
If there be any impediment , I pray you discover it .
A witty mother !
By your patience , I needs must rest me .
Why then , let fall Your horrible pleasure .
You shall never take her without her answer unless you take her without her tongue .
Descend , brother , I say .
And what say'st thou then to my love ?
His answer was , the people were not used To be spoke to but by the recorder .
No , I will not cast away my physic but on those that are sick .
Art thou so hasty ?
Set your heart at rest .
Nay , good lieutenant !
Give me leave To speak my mind , and I will through and through Cleanse the foul body of th ' infected world , If they will patiently receive my medicine .
But for which of my good parts did you first suffer love for me ?
Have you any further trade with us ?
That would I , were I of all kingdoms king .
Two of both kinds make up four .
Doth not my wit become me rarely ?
She speaks .
Nothing .
Mistress , both man and master is possessed .
O good old man , how well in thee appears The constant service of the antique world , When service sweat for duty , not for meed .
This wedding day Perhaps is but prolonged .
Here I stand , your slave , A poor , infirm , weak , and despised old man .
Hark thee , Clitus .
That is the way to make her scorn you still .
I can not bid you bid my daughter live , That were impossible , but , I pray you both , Possess the people in Messina here How innocent she died .
Be 't so .
Thou protector of this damned strumpet , Talk'st thou to me of "ifs" ?
I will discharge thee ere I go from thee .
Thy slander hath gone through and through her heart , And she lies buried with her ancestors , Oh , in a tomb where never scandal slept Save this of hers , framed by thy villainy .
Sir , there is especial commission come from Venice to depute Cassio in Othello's place .
I will deal in poison with thee , or in bastinado , or in steel .
It can not be .
Was this ambition ?
Ay , marry , sir , now it begins to work .
Strike , I say !
Your reason .
Those that will follow Cassius , go with him , And public reasons shall be rendered Of Caesar's death .
I have a device to make all well .
Murder ?
What says Lord Stanley ?
Is supper ready , the house trimmed , rushes strewed , cobwebs swept , the servingmen in their new fustian , their white stockings , and every officer his wedding garment on ?
You can not revel into dukedoms there .
Beat him enough .
The wiser , the waywarder .
O sinful thought !
Good signior , you shall more command with years Than with your weapons .
Your friends are up and buckle on their armor .
But let it rest. , Now , Litio , to you .
I am not in the giving vein today .
Not tonight , good Iago .
Pour in sow's blood , that hath eaten Her nine farrow ; grease that's sweaten From the murderer's gibbet throw Into the flame .
I know his eye doth homage otherwhere , Or else what lets it but he would be here ?
What's that to thee ?
Iras , long farewell .
Let me see now ,
The sweet and bitter fool Will presently appear , The one in motley here , The other found out there .
Give me a living reason she's disloyal .
The sum of all I can , I have disclosed .
Room , ho !
Until I know this sure uncertainty I'll entertain the offered fallacy .
Why do you stay so long , my lords of France ?
How shalt thou hope for mercy , rendering none ?
An oath , an oath , I have an oath in heaven .
Indeed , the French may lay twenty French crowns to one they will beat us , for they bear them on their shoulders .
Fie upon "But yet." "But yet" is as a jailer to bring forth Some monstrous malefactor .
O , quicken them with thine !
I know , sir , I am no flatterer .
Cousins , you know what you have to do. , O , I cry you mercy , friend .
Stand aside .
Fellow , come from the throng .
Crystal is muddy .
I thank thee , good Tubal .
My lord , you know I love you .
I tell thee , Litio , this is wonderful !
May 't please your highness sit .
I fear thee not .
Banquo , thy soul's flight , If it find heaven , must find it out tonight .
I remember thine eyes well enough .
Before the time I did Lysander see Seemed Athens as a paradise to me .
Catesby , fly to the duke .
Send the deed after me , And I will sign it .
A messenger from Caesar .
Dispatch. , O love , That thou couldst see my wars today , and knew'st The royal occupation !
All dead .
In thy foul throat thou liest .
Content .
Then does he say he lent me Some shipping , unrestored .
is your merry humor altered ?
She is too big , I hope , for me to compass .
Why , sir , what's your conceit in that ?
But thou with mildness entertain'st thy wooers , With gentle conference , soft and affable .
Farewell .
I now repent I told the pursuivant , As too triumphing , how mine enemies Today at Pomfret bloodily were butchered , And I myself secure in grace and favor .
So will it fare with Claudio .
A dire induction am I witness to , And will to France , hoping the consequence Will prove as bitter , black , and tragical .
And therefore is Love said to be a child , Because in choice he is so oft beguiled .
The wolves have preyed , and look , the gentle day , Before the wheels of Phoebus , round about Dapples the drowsy east with spots of grey .
It is both he and she : Your son and daughter .
Tis time to part .
They met so near with their lips that their breaths embraced together .
These fifteen years you have been in a dream Or , when you waked , so waked as if you slept .
You are pictures out of door , bells in your parlors , wild-cats in your kitchens , saints in your injuries , devils being offended , players in your housewifery , and housewives in your beds .
Twas a fault unwilling .
Barnardo has my place .
To do what , Signior ?
Sir , Mark Antony Will e'en but kiss Octavia , and we'll follow .
Wilt thou make a trust a transgression ?
And leave us , Publius , lest that the people , Rushing on us , should do your age some mischief .
O , serve me well , and teach yourselves that duty !
Then one of you will prove a shrunk panel and , like green timber , warp , warp .
I think he be transformed into a beast , For I can nowhere find him like a man .
He was but a fool that brought My answer back .
Why sweat they under burdens ?
Why , whose is it ?
Now from head to foot I am marble-constant .
I mean , sir , for his weapon .
Not a hair perished .
And come you now with "knocking at the gate" ?
My lord , I know not what the matter is , but to my judgment your highness is not entertained with that ceremonious affection as you were wont .
Let go , slave , or thou diest !
Leave you your power to draw , And I shall have no power to follow you .
Tis certain .
Within my tent his bones tonight shall lie Most like a soldier , ordered honorably .
Lord , how it looks about !
But this place is too cold for hell .
If from the field I shall return once more To kiss these lips , I will appear in blood .
Most royal sir , Fleance is 'scaped .
Marvelous sweet music !
Why , madam , have I offered love for this , To be so flouted in this royal presence ?
When I am alone , why then I am Tranio ; But in all places else , your master Lucentio .
Those his goodly eyes , That o'er the files and musters of the war Have glowed like plated Mars , now bend , now turn The office and devotion of their view Upon a tawny front .
What thou wouldst highly , That wouldst thou holily ; wouldst not play false , And yet wouldst wrongly win .
Look to your house , your daughter , and your bags !
He shall not live .
If Caesar had stabbed their mothers they would have done no less .
These couchings and these lowly courtesies Might fire the blood of ordinary men And turn preordinance and first decree Into the law of children .
I dare swear this is the right Vincentio .
Well , time is the old justice that examines all such offenders , and let time try .
The Moor replies That he you hurt is of great fame in Cyprus And great affinity , and that in wholesome wisdom He might not but refuse you .
But let that go .
O Iras , Charmian !
Thy mother's name is ominous to children .
Therefore I took your hands , but was indeed Swayed from the point by looking down on Caesar .
Meet presently at the palace .
Are you so hasty now ?
And now , good friends , As you are friends , scholars and soldiers , Give me one poor request .
Come , you are too severe a moraler .
Happy were England would this virtuous prince Take on his grave the sovereignty thereof .
Nay , I will give thee a kiss .
Tis for the dead , not for the quick .
And thence from Athens turn away our eyes To seek new friends and stranger companies .
What Adam dost thou mean ?
Tis hatched , and shall be so .
But not with such familiar instances Nor with such free and friendly conference As he hath used of old .
What if a man bring him a hundred pound or two to make merry withal ?
Nay , take my life and all .
Did you converse , sir , with this gentlewoman ?
Tell me but this , Have you not sometimes seen a handkerchief Spotted with strawberries in your wife's hand ?
A likely piece of work , that you should find it in your chamber , and not know who left it there !
He can not like her long .
You do advance your cunning more and more .
So all .
Service .
No .
Remember thee !
If thou speak'st false , Upon the next tree shall thou hang alive Till famine cling thee .
You have of late stood out against your brother , and he hath ta'en you newly into his grace , where it is impossible you should take true root but by the fair weather that you make yourself .
I have done the deed .
Where is the king ?
What's the matter ?
No , no , I am as ugly as a bear , For beasts that meet me run away for fear .
Take up my mistress ' gown to his master's use !
We shall obey , were she ten times our mother .
Something from Cyprus as I may divine .
Along with them They brought one Pinch , a hungry , lean-faced villain , A mere anatomy , a mountebank , A threadbare juggler , and a fortune-teller , A needy , hollow-eyed , sharp-looking wretch , A living dead man .
What is 't ?
I will kill thee a hundred and fifty ways .
But no metal can , No , not the hangman's axe , bear half the keenness Of thy sharp envy .
My bond to the Jew is forfeit .
O Brutus !
Now , Antony , our hopes are answered .
The king's son have I landed by himself , Whom I left cooling of the air with sighs In an odd angle of the isle , and sitting , His arms in this sad knot .
Come , come away .
He's a friend of the Duke Alencon's .
If you will watch his going thence ( which I will fashion to fall out between twelve and one ) you may take him at your pleasure .
He hath no daughters , sir .
Know'st thou the way to Dover ?
No more .
As thou'rt a man , Give me the cup .
Where did you die ?
Come , come , You'll never meet a more sufficient man .
Hugh Capet also , who usurped the crown Of Charles the duke of Lorraine , sole heir male Of the true line and stock of Charles the Great , To find his title with some shows of truth , Though in pure truth it was corrupt and naught , Conveyed himself as th ' heir to th ' Lady Lingare , Daughter to Charlemagne , who was the son To Lewis the Emperor , and Lewis the son Of Charles the Great .
You lack a man's heart .
O happy fair !
The king doth love you well .
I am to blame to be thus waited for .
The gods do this in shame of cowardice .
News , madam .
Flat burglary as ever was committed .
I will tell you .
Leave , gentle wax , and , manners , blame us not .
They are afoot .
He needs not .
If thou dost love me Show me thy thought .
The villain shall not 'scape .
Use me but as your spaniel , spurn me , strike me , Neglect me , lose me .
But life , being weary of these worldly bars , Never lacks power to dismiss itself .
I'll about And drive away the vulgar from the streets .
My lord , I shall reply amazedly , Half sleep , half waking .
They did so , to th ' amazement of mine eyes That looked upon 't .
Where's the cook ?
Oh , monstrous !
Tis the last service that I shall command you .
What you have charged me with , that have I done , And more , much more .
But this it is : our foot Upon the hills adjoining to the city Shall stay with us .
What's the matter ?
I know my hour is come .
How 'gree you now ?
O sir , you are too sure an augurer .
You must say "paragon." A "paramour" is , God bless us , a thing of naught .
Beseech you , father .
There was none such in the army of any sort .
Go with me .
Hail , most dear Caesar !
Look you , the worm is not to be trusted but in the keeping of wise people , for indeed there is no goodness in the worm .

Yet I have known those which have walked in their sleep who have died holily in their beds .
I have nothing with this answer , Hamlet .
I pray you , one of you question yond man , if he for gold will give us any food .
You may go to the devil's dam !
She will be pleased .
Neither good nor bad .
Where should I lose that handkerchief , Emilia ?
Treason has done his worst ; nor steel nor poison , Malice domestic , foreign levy , nothing Can touch him further .
I am glad of it .

Therefore bear up and board 'em. , Servant- monster , drink to me .
Petruchio , go thy ways ; the field is won .
Saddle my horses .
But there the Duke was given to understand That in a gondola were seen together Lorenzo and his amorous Jessica .
To this , add defiance , and tell him , for conclusion , he hath betrayed his followers , whose condemnation is pronounced." So far my king and master ; so much my office .
As I do live , my honored lord , 'tis true .
No , faith , not a jot .
Oh , couldst thou speak , That I might hear thee call great Caesar ass Unpolicied !
A gentle scroll .
To whom in all this presence speaks your Grace ?
It will make you melancholy , Monsieur Jaques .
Or neither ?
That which you are , my thoughts can not transpose .
Will you dispatch us here under this tree , or shall we go with you to your chapel ?
Marry , I'll teach you .
We'll wait upon your lordship .
Why , he is the Prince's jester , a very dull fool , only his gift is in devising impossible slanders .
Why , man ?
If his fitness speaks , mine is ready , now or whensoever , provided I be so able as now .
I'll not have it so .
I'll none now .
First , good Peter Quince , say what the play treats on , then read the names of the actors , and so grow to a point .
Come , Let's have one other gaudy night .
And what wilt thou do , beg when that is spent ?
I have , when you have heard what I can say .
How long hath she been thus ?
I do desire it with all my heart , and I hope it is no dishonest desire to desire to be a woman of the world .
What should the wars do with these jigging fools ?
Therefore , since brevity is the soul of wit And tediousness the limbs and outward flourishes , I will be brief : your noble son is mad .

Put your torches out .
Come , away .
My dear Othello !
Foul words is but foul wind , and foul wind is but foul breath , and foul breath is noisome .
Tomorrow We'll hear ourselves again .
I did send To you for gold to pay my legions , Which you denied me .
Sister , have comfort .
A Cornish name .
Some dungeon .
I pray you , sir , hold your hand .
Think upon Vaughan , and with guilty fear Let fall thy lance .
Or rather , do thy pleasure .
Revolving this will teach thee how to curse .
I like you lads .
But there's no bottom , none , In my voluptuousness .
Friendship is constant in all other things Save in the office and affairs of love .

I do not like the Tower , of any place. , Did Julius Caesar build that place , my lord ?
Make your vaunting true , And it shall please me well .
What's that , I pray ?
That's more than we know .
Believe me , sir , had I such venture forth , The better part of my affections would Be with my hopes abroad .
And , as you said ( and wisely was it said ) 'T is meet that some more audience than a mother , Since nature makes them partial , should o'erhear The speech , of vantage .
Yea , art thou there ?
There's money for thee .
As from your graves rise up , and walk like sprites , To countenance this horror !
As I learned , The night before there was no purpose in them Of this remove .
I pray you all , stand up .
I see , sir , you are eaten up with passion .
Well , say , sir .
Do me no foul play , friends .
Why in that rawness left you wife and child , Those precious motives , those strong knots of love , Without leave-taking ?
Madam , do you .
That's fouler .
Therefore I pray you That to our sister you do make return .
Speak , my fair , and fairly , I pray thee .
You mistake , sir , you mistake , sir .
But upon the fairest boughs , Or at every sentence end , Will I "Rosalinda" write , Teaching all that read to know The quintessence of every sprite Heaven would in little show .

I am informed thoroughly of the cause .
Calls your Worship ?
Save thee , Curan .
I will not shame myself to give you this .
Heavens thank you for 't !
Farewell , sweet masters both .
Oh , give us leave , great king , To view the field in safety and dispose Of their dead bodies .
Yea , Signior , and depart when you bid me .
My charms I'll break , their senses I'll restore , And they shall be themselves .
We will hear Caesar's will .
Your mistress bears well .
I have performed Your pleasure and my promise .

Grandam , one night as we did sit at supper , My uncle Rivers talked how I did grow More than my brother : "Ay , " quoth my uncle Gloucester , "Small herbs have grace ; great weeds do grow apace." And since , methinks I would not grow so fast Because sweet flowers are slow and weeds make haste .

Am I myself ?
That done , I will be walking on the works , Repair there to me .
Faith , like enough .
That is the chain , sir , which you had of me .

Most sincerely .
Stay here .
And Cassius too .

Why , Am I not i ' th ' right , old Jephthah ?
I muse why she's at liberty .
I saw him once .
Let me but bind it hard , within this hour It will be well .
I ' faith , he'll have a lusty widow now That shall be wooed and wedded in a day .
Now , unto thy bones good night !
The Duke's in council and your noble self , I am sure , is sent for .
I would not hear your enemy say so , Nor shall you do mine ear that violence , To make it truster of your own report Against yourself .
I will not trouble thee , my child .
Set you down this ,
I pray you , choose another subject .
At our synagogue , Tubal .
Tis even so .
The interim's mine .
Nothing that I respect , my gracious lord .
That's very true , my lord .
I had rather be a country servant-maid Than a great queen with this condition , To be so baited , scorned , and stormed at .
Why , so he doth , when he delivers you From this earth's thralldom to the joys of heaven .
That would hang us , every mother's son .
Sirs , take up the corse .
I denied you not .
How shall we then behold their natural tears ?
What was the second noise for ?
Tomorrow , and tomorrow , and tomorrow , Creeps in this petty pace from day to day To the last syllable of recorded time , And all our yesterdays have lighted fools The way to dusty death .
Could not this make thee know The hate I bear thee made me leave thee so ?
The strings , my lord , are false .
Well , officer , arrest him at my suit .
Finish , good lady .
Marry , this it is , sir .
I do now let loose my opinion , hold it no longer : this is no fish , but an islander that hath lately suffered by a thunderbolt .
Scorn and defiance , slight regard , contempt , And anything that may not misbecome The mighty sender , doth he prize you at .
Therefore away , to get our stuff aboard .
Would that fault were mine !
So he does indeed .
My lord ?
Do you know them ?
And that distilled by magic sleights Shall raise such artificial sprites As by the strength of their illusion Shall draw him on to his confusion .
I feared he did but trifle And meant to wreck thee .
Nay , come , let's go together .
He has almost supped .
There's hope in 't yet .
You speak this to fetch me in , my lord .
It is .
I am sure I am none such .
Alas , good gentleman !
I can not speak of this .
Upon what bargain do you give it me ?
Farewell .
Is it not strange , Canidius , That from Tarentum and Brundusium He could so quickly cut the Ionian sea And take in Toryne ? , You have heard on 't , sweet ?
Look , with what courteous action It waves you to a more removed ground .
Two thousand ducats by the year of land !
Do you not remember he saw a flea stick upon Bardolph's nose , and he said it was a black soul burning in hell ?
Nothing can be made out of nothing .
Is there a murderer here ?
Dost thou know me , fellow ?
I would have all well betwixt you .
I come to fetch you to the senate house .
Macbeth !
My lord , good morrow .
Lorenzo , I commit into your hands The husbandry and manage of my house Until my lord's return .
Give him tending .
Nay , we will all of us be there to fetch him .
If not , assure yourself I will seek satisfaction of you .
Good my lord , enter here .
Forever and forever farewell , Brutus .
Meantime , but think how I may do thee good , And be inheritor of thy desire .
And for my love I pray you wrong me not .
Tis mightiest in the mightiest .
Do they hold the same estimation they did when I was in the city ?
I must take out the work ?
The blow thou hadst Shall make thy peace for moving me to rage , And I will boot thee with what gift beside Thy modesty can beg .
Peace then !
Who was last with them ?
Hero thinks surely she will die , for she says she will die if he love her not , and she will die ere she make her love known , and she will die if he woo her rather than she will bate one breath of her accustomed crossness .
Ay , now am I in Arden , the more fool I .
This way , my lord .
Say , my spirit , How fares the king and 's followers ?
Farewell .
I am not Cinna the conspirator .
There is no terror , Cassius , in your threats , For I am armed so strong in honesty That they pass by me as the idle wind , Which I respect not .
A calendar , a calendar !
For certain she is dead , and by strange manner .
But being widow , and my Gloucester with her , May all the building in my fancy pluck Upon my hateful life .
Prepare you , generals .
Tis strange , strange .
And what's he then that says I play the villain ?
I urge this childhood proof Because what follows is pure innocence .
Could my good brother suffer you to do it , A man , a prince by him so benefited ?
Sovereign of Egypt , hail !
Speak , is 't out o ' th ' way ?
Not yet , my cousin .
The king and prince at prayers .
Nor I .
If so , my eyes are oftener washed than hers .
We pray you for your own sake to embrace your own safety and give over this attempt .
Quite dumb ?
If the balance of our lives had not one scale of reason to poise another of sensuality , the blood and baseness of our natures would conduct us to most prepost'rous conclusions .
Here , sir ! " You loggerheaded and unpolished grooms !
What , my dear Lady Disdain !
Call him hither to me , soldier .
Let him answer me. , Come , follow me , boy .
He may win , And what is music then ?
How many , as you guess ?
How now , friend Eros !
Let us our lives , our souls , our debts , our careful wives , our children , and our sins lay on the king !
True is it that we have seen better days And have with holy bell been knolled to church , And sat at good men's feasts and wiped our eyes Of drops that sacred pity hath engendered .
Good Lord !
I do not think so .
But what praise couldst thou bestow on a deserving woman indeed , one that in the authority of her merit did justly put on the vouch of very malice itself ?
My very hairs do mutiny , for the white Reprove the brown for rashness , and they them For fear and doting .
Did he receive you well ?
Take heed , sirrah , the whip .
She that , so young , could give out such a seeming , To seel her father's eyes up close as oak , He thought 'twas witchcraft .
And second father This lady makes him to me .
No , heavens forfend , I would not kill thy soul !
She bids you come to her .
Give me thy hand .
I cry you mercy , uncle. , By your Grace's pardon .
If you do love Rosalind so near the heart as your gesture cries it out , when your brother marries Aliena shall you marry her .
Tis double wrong to truant with your bed And let her read it in thy looks at board .
Your reason ?
Is he well ?
Masters , play here , I will content your pains .
Despair , and die !
Do so , and after two days I will discharge thee .
My Lord of Warwick and my brother Gloucester , Follow Fluellen closely at the heels .
I can not think it .
But as I think , for truly would I speak , And now do I bethink me , so it is , I came with Hermia hither .
Look , he recovers .
There may as well be amity and life 'Tween snow and fire , as treason and my love .
More , I prithee , more .
And I for Rosalind .
Is this well done ?
And yet I would not be thee , nuncle .
Therefore prepare thyself .
Or be alive again , And dare me to the desert with thy sword .
A good man's fortune may grow out at heels .
Pray you Be ever known to patience .
There is no love in you .
God keep you from them , and from such false friends .
For this present , I would not , so with love I might entreat you , Be any further moved .
I'll bring you to him straight .
What sayest thou now ?
She hath the stones upon her , and the ducats." Why , all the boys in Venice follow him , Crying , "His stones , his daughter , and his ducats ! "
Rub him about the temples .
A little water clears us of this deed .
O , belike his majesty hath some intent That you shall be new christened in the Tower .
I prithee , boy , run to the senate house .
I pray , weep not .
Fie upon 't , foh !
Now shall you see the other .
All comfort that the dark night can afford Be to thy person , noble father-in-law .
That's a perilous shot out of an elder gun , that a poor and private displeasure can do against a monarch .
What needs this iterance , woman ?
It is a kind of history .
Out upon it , old carrion !
Your friends at Pomfret , they do need the priest ; Your Honor hath no shriving work in hand .
These three world-sharers , these competitors , Are in thy vessel .
How can that be , when you have the voice of the king himself for your succession in Denmark ?
I thank my noble lord .
Never excuse , for when the players are all dead , there needs none to be blamed .
No , you unnatural hags ,
Night hangs upon mine eyes .
All things shall be well .
Ay , dread Queen .
Good master , take it not unkindly , pray , That I have been thus pleasant with you both .
Tomorrow , soldier , By sea and land I'll fight .
He did command me to call timely on him .
By and by .
Thyself shalt see the act .
That island of England breeds very valiant creatures .
For love I followed him .
Tis yours , and we , Your scutcheons and your signs of conquest , shall Hang in what place you please .
I pray you now receive them .
If then true lovers have been ever crossed , It stands as an edict in destiny .
No occupation .
Yea , just so much as you may take upon a knife's point and choke a daw withal .
Use it for my love some other way than swearing by it .
Norfolk , we must have knocks , ha , must we not ?
But make amends now .
We are their parents and original .
By heavens , the duke shall know how slack you have been .
She that would be your wife now ran from you .
Cicero one ?
Welcome , Iago .
Strives in his little world of man to outscorn The to-and-fro-conflicting wind and rain .
O most false love !
What if I strayed no further , but chose here ?
Of lusty earls : Grandpre and Roussi , Faulconbridge and Foix , Beaumont and Marle , Vaudemont and Lestrale .
Let us toward the king .
Twas I indeed thou promised'st to strike , And thou hast given me most bitter terms .
Safely stowed .
Believe me , sir , they butt together well .
We came hither to fight with you .
I will proclaim my name about the field .
Another general shout !
Come , draw the curtain , Nerissa .
She is persuaded I will marry her , out of her own love and flattery , not out of my promise .
So shall he waste his means , weary his soldiers , Doing himself offense , whilst we , lying still , Are full of rest , defense , and nimbleness .
As of a man faithful and honorable .
So we grew together , Like to a double cherry , seeming parted But yet an union in partition , Two lovely berries molded on one stem ;
Tis safer to be that which we destroy Than by destruction dwell in doubtful joy .
Abate the edge of traitors , gracious Lord , That would reduce these bloody days again , And make poor England weep in streams of blood !
You're sad , Signior Balthasar .
The English are embattled , you French peers .
Age can not wither her , nor custom stale Her infinite variety .
What , will you walk with me about the town And then go to my inn and dine with me ?
Madam ?
No blown ambition doth our arms incite , But love , dear love ! , and our aged father's right .
There's not a one of them but in his house I keep a servant fee'd .
Is 't possible you will away tonight ?
Alas , what danger will it be to us , Maids as we are , to travel forth so far ?
Here , take away this dish .
Tomorrow , Before the sun shall see 's , we'll spill the blood That has today escaped .
I like the work well .
No doubt but he hath got a quiet catch .
I here take my oath before this honorable assembly , she kicked the poor king her father .
We two , my lord , Will guard your person while you take your rest And watch your safety .
A pair of stocks , you rogue !
Pray you , be careful .
I urged you further , then you scratched your head And too impatiently stamped with your foot .
For what reason ?
I hear him .
Nay , I'll go with thee , cheek by jowl .
So , with two seeming bodies but one heart , Two of the first , like coats in heraldry , Due but to one and crowned with one crest .
This was the most unkindest cut of all .
I have heard Your grace hath ta'en great pains to qualify His rigorous course .
Well , if you were but an inch of fortune better than I , where would you choose it ?
Gentle cousin , Let us go thank him and encourage him .
Three and three , We'll hold a feast in great solemnity .
I am not well .
Shall they hoist me up And show me to the shouting varletry Of censuring Rome ?
Behold : it is the privilege of mine honors , My oath , and my profession .
They could be content To visit other places , and come down With fearful bravery , thinking by this face To fasten in our thoughts that they have courage .
I do not desire he should answer for me , and yet I determine to fight lustily for him .
Sound , trumpet !
And if tomorrow Our navy thrive , I have an absolute hope Our landmen will stand up .
I pray you , have a continent forbearance till the speed of his rage goes slower .
Brought you Caesar home ?
Yea , and the best person too .
Pray you , let's have no more fooling about it , but give me your blessing .
Tis not fit thus to obey him .
It is a letter from my brother that I have not all o'er-read .
How beauteous mankind is !
No , rather I will go to Benedick And counsel him to fight against his passion ; And truly I'll devise some honest slanders To stain my cousin with .
Let her be thine , for we Have no such daughter , nor shall ever see That face of hers again .
O , help him , you sweet heavens !
Dost thou think If I would stand against thee , would the reposal Of any trust , virtue , or worth in thee Make thy words faithed ?
Have patience , madam .
The story is extant , and writ in choice Italian .
Good morrow , neighbor , whither away so fast ?
You have me , have you not ?
But here's a parchment with the seal of Caesar .
Ay .
Rumble thy bellyful !
Shall I do that which all the Parthian darts , Though enemy , lost aim and could not ?
Avaunt , thou witch ! , Come , Dromio , let us go .
Mark Antony , here , take you Caesar's body .
Come on , sir .
Where is he now ?
Either heaven with lightning strike the murderer dead , Or earth gape open wide and eat him quick , As thou dost swallow up this good king's blood , Which his hell-governed arm hath butchered !
Will you pleasure me ?
What paper were you reading ?
No harm .
And I for Ganymede .
Heart , once be stronger than thy continent .
Marry , beshrew my hand If it should give your age such cause of fear .
Father , I am glad you are come .
And Benedick is not the unhopefulest husband that I know .
Scape being drunk for want of wine .
I take no pleasure In aught an eunuch has .
He did in some sort , indeed , handle women , but then he was rheumatic , and talked of the Whore of Babylon .
I would breed from hence occasions , and I shall , That I may speak .
With robbers ' hands my hospitable favors You should not ruffle thus .
How hast thou lost thy breath ?
If th ' other two be brained like us , the state totters .
Ha , Portia ?
Will it not be received , When we have marked with blood those sleepy two Of his own chamber and used their very daggers , That they have done 't ?
Proceed .
Fulvia thy wife is dead .
Then Edgar was abused .
I will withdraw To furnish me with some swift means of death For the fair devil .
Besides , I like you not .
How far'st thou , soldier ?
Have we devils here ?
They have said their prayers , and they stay for death .
Thus losers part .
You'll pay me the eight shillings I won of you at betting ?
Hear his speech but say thou nought .
But well and free , If thou so yield him , there is gold , and here My bluest veins to kiss , a hand that kings Have lipped , and trembled kissing .
To the tuition of God .
Say I , her sovereign , am her subject low .
Why , then , tomorrow I can not serve your turn for Rosalind ?
For heaven's sake , help me !
And here am I , and wood within this wood , Because I can not meet my Hermia .
Whither are you going ?
And yet it is not : it is but so-so .
Hath she forsook so many noble matches , Her father and her country , and her friends , To be called "whore" ?
Is that my prize ?
I am never merry when I hear sweet music .
I'll court his favors .
I stand for judgment .
Pray God , I say , I prove a needless coward !
First let us go to dinner .
A most unhappy one .
It would become me As well as it does you , and I should do it With much more ease , for my good will is to it And yours it is against .
To who , my lord ? , Who hath the office ?
And buried , gentle Tyrrel ?
I shall answer that better to the commonwealth than you can the getting up of the Negro's belly .
Do Poor Tom some charity , whom the foul fiend vexes .
Rumor it abroad That Anne my wife is very grievous sick .
He shall have merely justice and his bond .
Therefore I'll sleep again .
I will go on the slightest errand now to the Antipodes that you can devise to send me on .
I shall find time , Cassius , I shall find time .
When a wise man gives thee better counsel , give me mine again .
Prithee , keep up thy quillets .
He is justly served .
My liege , here is a villain and a traitor , that , look your Grace , has struck the glove which your Majesty is take out of the helmet of Alencon .
Not poppy nor mandragora Nor all the drowsy syrups of the world , Shall ever medicine thee to that sweet sleep Which thou owedst yesterday .
Madam , I will .
I speak in understanding .
Master , here's The gold you sent me for .
Let it be so .
Be choked with such another emphasis !
More to know Did never meddle with my thoughts .
Now must your conscience my acquaintance seal , And you must put me in your heart for friend , Sith you have heard , and with a knowing ear , That he which hath your noble father slain Pursued my life .
Mark Antony shall say I am not well , And for thy humor I will stay at home .
If I can recover him and keep him tame , I will not take too much for him .
The lieutenant is to be saved before the ancient .
Well have you heard , but something hard of hearing .
I saw him yesterday" , or "t ' other day , " Or then , or then , with such or such , "and , as you say , There was he gaming , there o'ertook in's rouse , There falling out at tennis , " or , perchance , "I saw him enter such a house of sale" , Your bait of falsehood takes this carp of truth .
Braved in mine own house with a skein of thread ?
You wronged yourself to write in such a case .
So well thy words become thee as thy wounds ; They smack of honor both .
Thanks , dear my lord .
But there is , sir , an eyrie of children , little eyases , that cry out on the top of question and are most tyrannically clapped for 't .
Is it his use ?
Thou know'st we work by wit and not by witchcraft , And wit depends on dilatory time .
No , by this heavenly light !
The readiest way to make the wench amends Is to become her husband and her father ; The which will I , not all so much for love As for another secret close intent By marrying her which I must reach unto .
The taming school ?
Ay .
I sent you money , sir , to be your bail By Dromio , but I think he brought it not .
My lord , I have .
Nay , pray be covered .
It is the cry of women , my good lord .
It touches you , my lord , as much as me .
I shall have glory by this losing day More than Octavius and Mark Antony By this vile conquest shall attain unto .
Here .
But I pray you , ergo , old man , ergo , I beseech you , talk you of young Master Launcelot ?
I'll be at charges for a looking glass And entertain a score or two of tailors To study fashions to adorn my body .
This fellow doth not stand upon points .
God 'ild you for your last company .
This found I on my tent this morning .
Do you amend it then .
I doubt it is no other but the main : His father's death and our o'erhasty marriage .
I will not .
I promise you your kindred hath made my eyes water ere now .
Good my lord , what is your cause of distemper ?
A third can not be matched unless the devil himself turn Jew .
Nature presently distilled Helen's cheek , but not her heart , Cleopatra's majesty , Atalanta's better part , Sad Lucretia's modesty .
Trust me , I am glad on 't .
What , Pindarus !
Shall , Antipholus , Even in the spring of love thy love-springs rot ?
I will not sup tonight .
Ay , madam .
And I have been all this day to avoid him .
Look in my face .
Let me ask you one word in private .
Where is he ?
When Nature hath made a fair creature , may she not by Fortune fall into the fire ?
There's two or three of us have seen strange sights .
Good Enobarbus !
My lord !
But nature should bring forth Of its own kind all foison , all abundance , To feed my innocent people .
Fear me not , man .
This health to Lepidus !
Yet poor old heart , he holp the heavens to rain .
I fear thou wilt once more come again for a ransom .
What simple thief brags of his own attaint ?
Who could be out , being before his beloved mistress ?
We'll bury him , and then , what's brave , what's noble , Let's do 't after the high Roman fashion And make death proud to take us .
Lady , shall I lie in your lap ?
Hymen from heaven brought her , Yea , brought her hither , That thou mightst join her hand with his Whose heart within his bosom is .
Nay , that's certain .
Hear me , my lord .
It is not well done , mark you now , to take the tales out of my mouth ere it is made and finished .
Thyself a queen , for me that was a queen , Outlive thy glory , like my wretched self .
Uncouple in the western valley .
Oh , on my soul , my cousin is belied !
Very many , men and women too .
Tis no matter .
Answer me directly .
Here do you keep a hundred knights and squires , Men so disordered , so debauched and bold That this our court , infected with their manners , Shows like a riotous inn .
Once more , adieu .
If he awake , From toe to crown he'll fill our skins with pinches , Make us strange stuff .
That's certain .
O , how we joy to see your wit restored !
I did hear The galloping of horse .
I guess at it .
Your worth is very dear in my regard .
Great happiness !
Come , in what key shall a man take you to go in the song ?
That our garments , being , as they were , drenched in the sea , hold notwithstanding their freshness and glosses , being rather new-dyed than stained with salt water .
Did you see Master Lorenzo ?
Who is it in the press that calls on me ?
Thieves !
Silence awhile. , Robin , take off this head. , Titania , music call , and strike more dead Than common sleep of all these five the sense .
Know you not he has ?
Ay , do you fear it ?
Why , thy godhead laid apart , Warr'st thou with a woman's heart ?
Well , all is one .
The French might have a good prey of us if he knew of it , for there is none to guard it but boys .
I do , truly , for thou swear'st to me thou art honest .
Farewell .
The starry welkin cover thou anon With drooping fog as black as Acheron , And lead these testy rivals so astray As one come not within another's way .
My curses on her !
Monstrous !
They are pitiful .
She false with Cassio !
Let's alone , And do the murder first .
Therefore , great King , We yield our town and lives to thy soft mercy .
Gallus , go you along .
How now , my dear Othello ?
The king's a bawcock , and a heart of gold , A lad of life , an imp of fame , Of parents good , of fist most valiant .
I have sent for these strawberries .
Put on your nightgown .
Mustardseed .
To the vales , And hold our best advantage .
Till then sit still , my soul .
He is as full of valor as of kindness , Princely in both .
What is the matter ?
Tis brief , my lord .
Have you not set Lysander , as in scorn , To follow me and praise my eyes and face ?
You break jests as braggarts do their blades , which , God be thanked , hurt not. , My lord , for your many courtesies I thank you .
Where America , the Indies ?
But yet It is our trick .
Who , I ?
But in this kind , wanting your father's voice , The other must be held the worthier .
So , so , so .
He did ask favor .
My good lords both , with all the heed I can .
To suckle fools and chronicle small beer .
An if I be , sir , is it any offense ?
I hold you but a subject of this war , Not as a brother .
Launcelot and I are out .
Out , tawny Tartar , out !
Do not rise yet .
Why , what effects of passion shows she ?
You men of Cyprus , let her have your knees .
And good monsieur , have a care the honey bag break not .
It is not for your health thus to commit Your weak condition to the raw , cold morning .
I will , my lord , with all convenient haste .
What hath quenched them hath given me fire .
I will weep for nothing , like Diana in the fountain , and I will do that when you are disposed to be merry .
Then learn this of me : to have is to have .
Nothing certainer .
Ay , if you dare do yourself a profit and a right .
They mean this night in Sardis to be quartered .
But how is it That this lives in thy mind ?
Till which encounter It is my business too .
Didst thou see any thing ?
Why , very well then .
How I have thought of this and of these times I shall recount hereafter .
I am debating of my present store , And by the near guess of my memory I can not instantly raise up the gross Of full three thousand ducats .
By the world , I think my wife be honest and think she is not .
That handkerchief Which I so loved and gave thee , thou gav'st To Cassio .
Then how can it be said I am alone When all the world is here to look on me ?
We are glad the Dauphin is so pleasant with us .
Many times , madam .
I'll teach you how to flow .
Come , no matter vor your foins .
It is my arm .
Hem them away .
A guiltless death I die .
Jove's lightning , the precursors O ' th ' dreadful thunderclaps , more momentary And sight-outrunning were not .
Thou shalt not die .
While grace is saying , hood mine eyes Thus with my hat , and sigh and say , "Amen" , Use all the observance of civility Like one well studied in a sad ostent To please his grandam , never trust me more .
He hath disgraced me and hindered me half a million , laughed at my losses , mocked at my gains , scorned my nation , thwarted my bargains , cooled my friends , heated mine enemies , and what's his reason ?
I will follow .
I am an ass ; else it could never be But I should know her as well as she knows me .
An I may hide my face , let me play Thisbe too !
Why then , your ambition makes it one .
Are you a god ?
I think so too .
My powers are crescent , and my auguring hope Says it will come to th' full .
At mine unworthiness , that dare not offer What I desire to give , and much less take What I shall die to want .
Your reason ?
I think the policy of that purpose made more in the marriage than the love of the parties .
How now ?
So the poor third is up , till death enlarge his confine .
They are beaten , sir , and our advantage serves For a fair victory .
I had most need of blessing , and "Amen" Stuck in my throat .
I leave an arrant knave with your Worship , which I beseech your Worship to correct yourself , for the example of others .
No epilogue , I pray you , for your play needs no excuse .
They are natural." For I believe they are portentous things Unto the climate that they point upon .
Go release them , Ariel .
Therefore , patiently and yielding .
So I will , my liege , as I live .
I hear it by the way ; but I will send .
An I had been a man of any occupation , if I would not have taken him at a word , I would I might go to hell among the rogues .
But for the seventh cause .
The passages of alleys , creeks , and narrow lands ; A hound that runs counter and yet draws dryfoot well , One that before the judgment carries poor souls to hell .
Methinks I hear Antony call .
There's the point .
The ladies , her attendants of her chamber Saw her abed , and in the morning early They found the bed untreasured of their mistress .
Think you to walk forth ?
I'll warrant she'll tax him home .
Signor , you are very near my brother in his love .
Let us go sit here upon the church bench till two , and then all to bed .
O day and night , but this is wondrous strange !
Ah , ha , my lord , this prince is not an Edward !
I wonder at it .
Come , I'll go in with you .
Approach the chamber , and destroy your sight With a new Gorgon .
What say you ?
He is welcome hither .
Live thou , I live .
Some of my shame , if you will know of me What man I am , and how , and why , and where This handkercher was stained .
A surgeon !
Oh , come apace , dispatch !
That chain will I bestow , Be it for nothing but to spite my wife , Upon mine hostess there .
I have well approved it , sir .
The wager ?
How fearful And dizzy 'tis to cast one's eyes so low !
Oh , she was heavenly true !
Or I have no observance .
Tis but a peevish boy , yet he talks well , But what care I for words ?
One of them rates All that is won and lost .
Oh , thou didst then ne'er love so heartily .
My master's a very Jew .
Dost thou forget From what a torment I did free thee ?
Tis not needed yet .
Here will I rest me till the break of day .
By mine honor I will , and when I break that oath , let me turn monster .
While one with moderate haste might tell a hundred .
Who can come in and say that I mean her , When such a one as she such is her neighbor ?
I can not tell .
Canidius , Our nineteen legions thou shalt hold by land , And our twelve thousand horse .
Fie upon thee !
No , I will go seek Some ditch wherein to die .
Be thou familiar but by no means vulgar .
Is there any ships put forth tonight ?
List a brief tale , And when 'tis told , oh , that my heart would burst !
Well then , confess and live .
Fly ?

To lend me arms and aid when I required them , The which you both denied .

Here's that shall drive some of them to a noncome .
A bird of my tongue is better than a beast of yours .
Now , Balthazar , As I have ever found thee honest true , So let me find thee still .

Eyes , do you see ?
I thank you , doctor .
I will laugh like a hyena , and that when thou art inclined to sleep .
Avaunt , you cullions !

What sayst thou to me now ?
In my mind's eye , Horatio .
Friends am I with you all and love you all Upon this hope : that you shall give me reasons Why and wherein Caesar was dangerous .
Not now , sweet Desdemona .
Five hundred poor I have in yearly pay , Who twice a day their withered hands hold up Toward heaven to pardon blood .
This is a very scurvy tune to sing at a man's funeral .
Come , Desdemona , I have but an hour Of love , of worldly matter and direction , To spend with thee .
And that were enough to hang us all .
Where may we set our horses ?
I think withal There would be hands uplifted in my right ; And here from gracious England have I offer Of goodly thousands .
Though it appear a little out of fashion , There is much care and valor in this Welshman .

Come , sir .
Remember'st thou any that have died on 't ?
As she is mine , I may dispose of her , Which shall be either to this gentleman Or to her death , according to our law Immediately provided in that case .
My resolution and my hands I'll trust , None about Caesar .
Your name , I pray you , friend ?
I humbly thank you .
You do extend These thoughts of horror further than you shall Find cause in Caesar .
Thus I let you go And give you to the gods .

If all the wine in my bottle will recover him , I will help his ague .
Yet he looks successfully .
What's the matter ?
Hark .
O Cicero , I have seen tempests when the scolding winds Have rived the knotty oaks , and I have seen Th ' ambitious ocean swell and rage and foam To be exalted with the threatening clouds , But never till tonight , never till now , Did I go through a tempest dropping fire .

Farewell , sweet playfellow .
And if thy poor devoted servant may But beg one favor at thy gracious hand , Thou dost confirm his happiness forever .
What's your will ?
Help !
But wherefore did you so much tempt the heavens ?
Madman and beggar too .
Zounds , who is there ?
An't please your Majesty , 'tis the gage of one that I should fight withal , if he be alive .
Thou hast taken against me a most just exception , but yet I protest I have dealt most directly in thy affair .
You may be rightly just , Whatever I shall think .
It's true , good lieutenant .
My mother .
Caesar's sister is called Octavia .
His words were , "Farewell , mistress." Nothing else .
You scarcely have the hearts to tell me so , And therefore can not have the hearts to do it .
Well , well , well .
Ill will never said well .
I shall do 't .
Nay , by Saint Jamy , I hold you a penny , A horse and a man Is more than one And yet not many .
But art not thou thyself giddy with the fashion too , that thou hast shifted out of thy tale into telling me of the fashion ?
You did know How much you were my conqueror , and that My sword , made weak by my affection , would Obey it on all cause .
I'll not endure it .

Fouler than heart can think thee , thou canst make No excuse current but to hang thyself .
Why , sir , cobble you .
Quickly send , Be brief in it , to th ' castle , for my writ Is on the life of Lear and on Cordelia .
Both your majesties Might , by the sovereign power you have of us , Put your dread pleasures more into command Than to entreaty .
And you , sir , for this chain arrested me .
I find not Myself disposed to sleep .
Are those my tents where I perceive the fire ?
Shall we hear from you , Catesby , ere we sleep ?
That's he that was Othello .
Therefore be out of hope , of question , of doubt .
If I owe you anything , I will pay you in cudgels .
Ay , but the clerk that never means to do it Unless he live until he be a man .
Are you our daughter ?
Why do people love you ?
I stand dishonored , that have gone about To link my dear friend to a common stale .
Brought to this town by that most famous warrior Duke Menaphon , your most renowned uncle .
Since he went from Egypt 'tis A space for farther travel .
There .
Ha !
O excellent motion !
Went he hence now ?
Where wilt thou lead me ?
Most like a gentleman .
Alack , alack !
Come , come , let us thither .
When are you married , madam ?
We shall further think on 't .
Away , then !
From helmet to the spur , all blood he was .
You could , for a need , study a speech of some dozen or sixteen lines which I would set down and insert in 't , could you not ?
If not , adieu .
And have you mercy too !
O Cassio , Cassio , Cassio !
Therefore thou sleep'st so sound .
All the better .
If it be so , It is a chance which does redeem all sorrows That ever I have felt .
I do not like her name .
I would have my bond .
O , grief hath changed me since you saw me last , And careful hours with time's deformed hand Have written strange defeatures in my face .
Well , good night .
Fly , therefore , noble Cassius , fly far off .
If he break the peace , he ought to enter into a quarrel with fear and trembling .
But here comes Antony. , Welcome , Mark Antony .
I am the duke That loved your father .
Let's follow , Gertrude .
When were you wont to use my sister thus ?
With no less religion than if thou wert indeed my Rosalind .
Come your ways .
I am a gentleman of a company .
I would sing my song without a burden .
Come , come .
Come , come , no longer will I be a fool , To put the finger in the eye and weep Whilst man and master laugh my woes to scorn .
Nay , that you shall not .
Princes have but their titles for their glories , An outward honor for an inward toil ,
Some of them will fall tomorrow , I hope .
Why didst thou send me forth , brave Cassius ?
Alack , alack !
Put money in thy purse .
Be quiet and depart .
Who lies i ' th ' second chamber ?
Who's born that day When I forget to send to Antony Shall die a beggar .
O royal Caesar !
There is no more but so .
Tis bootless to exclaim .
Damned as thou art , thou hast enchanted her !
What shall we hear of this ?
No , my lord , I saw nothing .
Then , good my liege , mistake me not so much To think my poverty is treacherous .
I heard myself proclaimed , And by the happy hollow of a tree Escaped the hunt .
There's another garment for 't .
Why , farewell , Portia .
Thy bed , lust-stained , shall with lust's blood be spotted .
No .
Stay not to answer me , but get thee gone .
A dream itself is but a shadow .
This villain of mine comes under the prediction , there's son against father .
How now , interjections ?
Thisbe ?
The soul and body rive not more in parting Than greatness going off .
The worm of conscience still begnaw thy soul .
All men I hope live so .
Now shall my friend Petruchio do me grace , And offer me disguised in sober robes To old Baptista as a schoolmaster Well seen in music , to instruct Bianca , That so I may , by this device at least , Have leave and leisure to make love to her And , unsuspected , court her by herself .
This is no place , this house is but a butchery .
Most true .
What will I do , think'st thou ?
Put out the light , and then put out the light .
Such a one is a natural philosopher .
It is , my lord .
And most poor matters Point to rich ends .
And then give them great meals of beef and iron and steel , they will eat like wolves and fight like devils .
Tell him , when that our princely father York Blessed his three sons with his victorious arm , He little thought of this divided friendship .
And then the boy , his clerk , That took some pains in writing , he begged mine .
So-so" is good , very good , very excellent good .
Nay , faith , let me not play a woman .
Farewell , farewell .
And , gentle master , I received no gold .
There is a cliff , whose high and bending head Looks fearfully in the confined deep .
I love thee not , therefore pursue me not .
A thousand thousand !
Will you come to bed , my lord ?
If a man do not erect in this age his own tomb ere he dies , he shall live no longer in monument than the bell rings and the widow weeps .
Remember that you call on me today .
O villain , villain !
Th ' abuse of greatness is when it disjoins Remorse from power .
All the world desires her .
I do desire no more .
Then God be blessed , it is the blessed sun .
Trail'st thou the puissant pike ?
I can tell your Majesty , the duke is a prave man .
Kate like the hazel-twig Is straight and slender and as brown in hue As hazel nuts , and sweeter than the kernels .
Will you lead , lords ?
If they make you not then the better answer , you may say they are not the men you took them for .
Who's that ?
Gertrude , do not drink .
So you may put a man in your belly .
Bid him therefore consider of his ransom , which must proportion the losses we have borne , the subjects we have lost , the disgrace we have digested , which , in weight to reanswer , his pettiness would bow under .
Nor will you not tell me who you are ?
We'll set thee to school to an ant to teach thee there's no laboring i ' th ' winter .
I am called .
I have done .
You are a fishmonger .
No , make it two more .
I fear he will prove the weeping philosopher when he grows old , being so full of unmannerly sadness in his youth .
I grant him bloody , Luxurious , avaricious , false , deceitful , Sudden , malicious , smacking of every sin That has a name .
Age , thou art shamed !
Nay , if an oily palm be not a fruitful prognostication , I can not scratch mine ear. , Prithee , tell her but a workaday fortune .
In cases of defense 'tis best to weigh The enemy more mighty than he seems .
How fares your grace ?
I pray you , look upon her .
How answer you for yourselves ?
I must love you and sue to know you better .
Excellent .
Thou'dst thank me but a little for my counsel ; And yet I'll promise thee she shall be rich , And very rich .
Sir , my good friend , I'll change that name with you .
Prithee , who is 't that thou mean'st ?
Farewell content !
Oh , thy vile lady !
A hundred marks , my Kate does put her down .
O Goneril , You are not worth the dust which the rude wind Blows in your face .
I would my father looked but with my eyes .
Hold then my sword and turn away thy face While I do run upon it .
Where's Dolabella , To second Proculeius ?
Think'st thou I jest ?
Your fortunes are alike .
Oh , by no means .
I serve the king , On whose employment I was sent to you .
Tedious it were to tell and harsh to hear .
I am the second son of old Sir Rowland , That bring these tidings to this fair assembly .
What man dost thou dig it for ?
By the pricking of my thumbs , Something wicked this way comes .
Why have you left the chamber ?
Tell me , if your art Can tell so much : shall Banquo's issue ever Reign in this kingdom ?
They are incensed .
Let them set on at once , for I perceive But cold demeanor in Octavius ' wing , And sudden push gives them the overthrow .
This is a man's invention , and his hand .
God give your Grace good rest .
Who meets us here ?
Woo't fast ?
Call not your stocks for me .
A sight most pitiful in the meanest wretch , Past speaking of in a king .
But , as he was ambitious , I slew him .
Give me your hands if we be friends , And Robin shall restore amends .
The life" ?
Very easily possible .
But one fiend at a time , I'll fight their legions o'er .
How but well , sir ?
I say gudday , Captain Fluellen .
Why , mistress , sure my master is horn mad .
In cash , most justly paid .
Comes not that blood as modest evidence To witness simple virtue ?
The tender prince Would fain have come with me to meet your Grace , But by his mother was perforce withheld .
By this , I think , the dial points at five .
If she be black , and thereto have a wit , She'll find a white that shall her blackness fit .
Tis mine and I will have it .
Nay , but I bar tonight .
Another way I have to man my haggard , To make her come and know her keeper's call .
And his unbookish jealousy must construe Poor Cassio's smiles , gestures , and light behavior Quite in the wrong. , How do you now , lieutenant ?
Rescue , my lord of Norfolk , rescue , rescue !
See" 't shalt thou never. , Fellows , hold the chair. , Upon these eyes of thine I'll set my foot .
Approach thou like the rugged Russian bear , The armed rhinoceros , or th ' Hyrcan tiger ; Take any shape but that , and my firm nerves Shall never tremble .
Oh !
What's that good for ?
Do not you love me ?
Here comes young Master Ganymede , my new mistress's brother .
Your brother Gloucester hates you .
Titinius , if thou lovest me , Mount thou my horse , and hide thy spurs in him Till he have brought thee up to yonder troops And here again , that I may rest assured Whether yond troops are friend or enemy .
That can I .
Why that's with watching , 'twill away again .
I'll be sworn , if thou be Launcelot , thou art mine own flesh and blood .
Within this hour I was his bondman sir , But he , I thank him , gnawed in two my cords .
This rudeness is a sauce to his good wit , Which gives men stomach to digest his words With better appetite .
Nothing , unless you render her again .
You may do your will , But he's a tried and valiant soldier .
You are not ignorant of what excellence Laertes is ,
Marry , my uncle Clarence ' angry ghost .
No , I went round to work , And my young mistress thus I did bespeak : "Lord Hamlet is a prince out of thy star .
I'll go find a shadow and sigh till he come .
Twill not be seen in him there .
But shall 't be shortly ?
This Lodovico is a proper man .
Even she : Leonato's Hero , your Hero , every man's Hero .
Even for that I thank you .
These are gracious drops .
You see how easily she may be surprised .
And then ?
He longs to eat the English .
Which is the villain ?
Are you not a strumpet ?
By thee ; and this thou didst return from him : That he did buffet thee and , in his blows , Denied my house for his , me for his wife .
Farewell .
Doth this news hold of good King Edward's death ?
Banquo !
Then be thou jocund .
Tis time we twain Did show ourselves i' th' field , and to that end Assemble we immediate council .
It would make a man mad as a buck to be so bought and sold .
Well roared , Lion !
What say you , Hermia ?
Art thou there , Diomed ?
I grant you .
But how did you desire it should be made ?
Keep peace , upon your lives .
Go with me to it , and I'll show it you ; and by the way you shall tell me where in the forest you live .
My name is Roderigo .
One ?
You mock me , madam .
For this time I will leave you .
If the matter of this paper be certain , you have mighty business in hand .
Down , therefore , and beg mercy of the Duke .
Say , uncle Gloucester , if our brother come , Where shall we sojourn till our coronation ?
Will you be married , motley ?
Why , 'tis not possible .
Give him this deed , And let him sign it .
You shall not choose but drink before you go .
Will you give thanks , sweet Kate , or else shall I ? , What's this ?
This sight would make him do a desperate turn , Yea , curse his better angel from his side And fall to reprobation .
Go you and maintain talk with the duke , that my charity be not of him perceived .
killed a cat ?
Come , let me wipe thy face .
You may be pleased to catch at mine intent By what did here befall me .
Brother , my lord the duke , Stand to and do as we .
In such a night as this !
Our foster nurse of nature is repose , The which he lacks , that to provoke in him Are many simples operative , whose power Will close the eye of anguish .
Now , Eros .
No more , no more .
Let pride , which she calls plainness , marry her .
Art thou his friend ?
Humbly , sir , I thank you .
Now heaven help him !
Now , Charmian !
Ay , so I thought .
The reason that I gather he is mad , Besides this present instance of his rage , Is a mad tale he told today at dinner Of his own doors being shut against his entrance .
I held the sword and he did run on it .
If consequence do but approve my dream My boat sails freely , both with wind and stream .
Do but now promise , Kate , you will endeavor for your French part of such a boy ; and for my English moiety take the word of a king and a bachelor .
He loves me well , and I have given him reasons .
But Antonio is certainly undone .
We'll bring him to his house with shouts and clamors .
Upon my life , by some device or other The villain is o'erraught of all my money .
I will be flesh and blood , For there was never yet philosopher That could endure the toothache patiently , However they have writ the style of gods And made a push at chance and sufferance .
I think I can discover him , if you please To get good guard and go along with me .
Thy shape invisible retain thou still .
What , are you answered yet ?
The motions of his spirit are dull as night , And his affections dark as Erebus .
All the conspirators save only he Did that they did in envy of great Caesar .
Firm and irrevocable is my doom Which I have passed upon her .
I had been happy if the general camp , Pioneers and all , had tasted her sweet body , So I had nothing known .
O most courageous day !
Seek !
Good friend , " quoth he , "Say the firm Roman to great Egypt sends This treasure of an oyster , at whose foot , To mend the petty present , I will piece Her opulent throne with kingdoms .
It is the best horse of Europe .
Unto the dignity and height of fortune , The high imperial type of this earth's glory .
Not know my voice !
So fare you well till we shall meet again .
Pardon me .
I told him that your father was at Venice , And that you looked for him this day in Padua .
Stand from the hearse .
His highness is not well .
This is kind I offer .
Now I am alone .
Who's there ?
Ay , my lord .
Now all the youth of England are on fire , And silken dalliance in the wardrobe lies .
All hell shall stir for this .
If I see anything tonight why I should not marry her , tomorrow in the congregation , where I should wed , there will I shame her .
The gods forbid !
So fare you well at once , for Brutus ' tongue Hath almost ended his life's history .
Those that do teach young babes Do it with gentle means and easy tasks .
Tis so strange That , though the truth of it stands off as gross As black and white , my eye will scarcely see it .
Shall we give o'er and drown ?
Yet thou liest in the bleak air .
But , hold thee , take this garland on thy brow .
Yet , if you be out , sir , I can mend you .
All may be well ; but if God sort it so , 'T is more than we deserve or I expect .
Foul , wrinkled witch , what mak'st thou in my sight ?
Signor Antonio , many a time and oft In the Rialto you have rated me About my moneys and my usances .
Better once than never , for never too late .
Aye , sir .
No more than from my soul I mourn for yours .
I know not what you mean by that , but I am sure Caesar fell down .
And her sister By her is poisoned .
Yes , sooth , and so do you .
O young and noble Cato , art thou down ?
Go fetch it , sister .
Hear me for my cause , and be silent that you may hear .
You strike my people , and your disordered rabble Make servants of their betters .
Fare you well .
My liege , your highness now may do me good .
Twill bring you gain or perish on the seas .
He came to me , and I delivered it .
Dost thou affect her , Claudio ?
Read it , Mark Antony !
Signor Benedick !
I hope this reason stands for my excuse .
But who comes here ?
Thou know'st the first time that we smell the air We wawl and cry .
True , noble prince .
I mean in singing .
Masters , the duke is coming from the temple , and there is two or three lords and ladies more married .
His name , my lord , is Tyrrel .
Poor Turlygod ! " "Poor Tom ! " , That's something yet .
Ha !
You touched my vein at first .
Here , Peter Quince .
A very even way , but no such friend .
Even so .
I have not dined today .
Neither .
Go bring the rabble , O'er whom I give thee power , here to this place .
Not once , nor twice , but twenty times you have .
Come , Menas .
It is , and wants but nomination .
My lord , I take my leave .
Let me still take away the harms I fear , Not fear still to be taken .
Did I not meet thy friends ?
Then walk we forth , even to the marketplace , And waving our red weapons o'er our heads Let's all cry , "Peace , freedom , and liberty ! " Stoop , then , and wash .
Hark , hark !
Great thing of us forgot ! , Speak , Edmund , where's the king ?
The gods confound thee !
Conceit upon her father .
I do entreat your grace to pardon me .
I prithee , recount some of them .
Haste me to know 't , that I , with wings as swift As meditation or the thoughts of love , May sweep to my revenge .
Nothing , Messala .
No marrying 'mong his subjects ?
He that sweetest rose will find Must find love's prick , and Rosalind .
I'll follow you .
Keep me in temper .
The Queen , my lord , the Queen .
I tax not you , you elements , with unkindness .
Prepare we for our marriage ; on which day , My Lord of Burgundy , we'll take your oath , And all the peers ' , for surety of our leagues .
Let me say "Amen" betimes , lest the devil cross my prayer , for here he comes in the likeness of a Jew .
The ways are dangerous .
The king is not to answer it .
My parts , my title , and my perfect soul Shall manifest me rightly .
Ay , if a woman live to be a man .
I loved Ophelia .
Good Ursula , wake my cousin Beatrice and desire her to rise .
I will ask him for my place again , he shall tell me I am a drunkard .
But truly , for mine own part , if I were as tedious as a king , I could find it in my heart to bestow it all of your worship .
Art thou thus boldened , man , by thy distress Or else a rude despiser of good manners , That in civility thou seem'st so empty ?
Hearts , tongues , figures , scribes , bards , poets , can not Think , speak , cast , write , sing , number , hoo ! , His love to Antony .
Know'st thou Fluellen ?
My Lord High Constable , the English lie within fifteen hundred paces of your tents .
I give him curses , yet he gives me love .
How tartly that gentleman looks !
I cry your worships ' mercy , heartily. , I beseech your worship's name .
But you , O you , So perfect and so peerless , are created Of every creature's best .
Call you me "fair" ?
Why , Fool ?
Plantagenet .
Why should he follow ?
O , spare my guiltless wife and my poor children ! , Keeper , I prithee sit by me awhile .
Why , man , they did make love to this employment .
If you do fight in safeguard of your wives , Your wives shall welcome home the conquerors .
They were traitors !
I am sent before to make a fire , and they are coming after to warm them .
So please your Lordship to accept our duty .
But this reasoning is not in the fashion to choose me a husband .
Had I a glass , I would .
I think it lacks of twelve .
Why , thou say'st true .
It sounds no more , and sure , it waits upon Some god o ' th ' island .
We now are near his cell .
Go , leave me .
Why , by making him uncapable of Othello's place : knocking out his brains .
You had musty victual , and he hath holp to eat it .
You have said now .
Those that are good manners at the court are as ridiculous in the country as the behavior of the country is most mockable at the court .

Let it suffice thee that I trust thee not .
Yes , I am .
Here's to thy health .
What's her name ?
Caesar , I shall .
That he hath used thee .
And what hope is that , I pray thee ?
Then we are rid of Litio .
You are a royal one , and we obey you .
Upon them !
Well , you are to call at all the alehouses and bid those that are drunk get them to bed .
Your sister is the better soldier .
I arrest thee of high treason , by the name of Richard , Earl of Cambridge .
I , as I may , that which I would I can not , , With best advantage will deceive the time , And aid thee in this doubtful shock of arms .
Good faith , and when I met this holy man , The men you talk of came into my mind .
You must translate .
I commend my duty to your lordship .
That is some good .

Had he done so ?
There attend my coming .

Which he will put on us as pigeons feed their young .
Did he ask for me ?
For if such actions may have passage free , Bond-slaves and pagans shall our statesmen be .
Oh my fair warrior !
My banquet is to close our stomachs up , After our great good cheer .
But if that I am I , then well I know Your weeping sister is no wife of mine , Nor to her bed no homage do I owe .
What concern they ?
No , monster , not I .
A friend .
It is not for you .
His company must do his minions grace , Whilst I at home starve for a merry look .
Hath Leonato any son , my lord ?
Well then , I know thee .
Will you stay awhile ?
A husband ?
He is most in the company of the right noble Claudio .
I am armed and well prepared. , Give me your hand , Bassanio .
What you would have I'll stay to know at your abandoned cave .
Ah , Rosencrantz !
Yet what can it when one can not repent ?
Fire and brimstone !
Let each man render me his bloody hand .
No evil lost is wailed when it is gone .
He would not ?
Lepidus is high-colored .
Now , where's my wife ?
To feed were best at home ; From thence , the sauce to meat is ceremony ; Meeting were bare without it .
Her husband , knave .
He's now in Florence .
We are blessed in the change .
I'll slit the villain's nose that would have sent me to the jail .
O madam , my old heart is cracked , it's cracked .
Within these three days let me hear thee say That Cassio's not alive .
My name is Pistol called .
Is 't come to this ?
O , then by day Where wilt thou find a cavern dark enough To mask thy monstrous visage ?
I thank your Honor .
The king hath granted every article , His daughter first , and , in sequel , all , According to their firm proposed natures .
They say he cried out of sack .
I understand a fury in your words , But not the words .
I found him here as melancholy as a lodge in a warren .
And come with naked swords .
Here in these confines slyly have I lurked To watch the waning of mine enemies .
Tis proper I obey him , but not now .
I will go before , sir. , Mistress , look out at window , for all this .
Come , "The croaking raven doth bellow for revenge , "
Why , ay .
When valor preys on reason , It eats the sword it fights with .
I think she'll sooner prove a soldier .
Why , so didst thou .
Sir , in my heart there was a kind of fighting That would not let me sleep .
Caesar , I go .
Your eyes drop millstones , when fools ' eyes drop tears .
Nay , let them go , a couple of quiet ones .
Will you mock at an ancient tradition begun upon an honorable respect and worn as a memorable trophy of predeceased valor , and dare not avouch in your deeds any of your words ?
I will condole in some measure. , To the rest. , Yet my chief humor is for a tyrant .
Tucket Once more I come to know of thee , King Harry , If for thy ransom thou wilt now compound , Before thy most assured overthrow .
By providence divine .
Fool , of thyself speak well .
And then the justice , In fair round belly with good capon lined , With eyes severe and beard of formal cut , Full of wise saws and modern instances ; And so he plays his part .
Ambition should be made of sterner stuff .
I mean , the matter that you read , my lord .
Shut doors after you .
Think on Lord Hastings .
Give me your blessing .
He received them Of him that brought them .
Marry , on Hero , the daughter and heir of Leonato .
Urge neither charity nor shame to me .
Here is more news .
God and the rope-maker bear me witness That I was sent for nothing but a rope .
Do so .
Say that I did all this for love of her .
Arise , you shall not kneel .
A most high miracle !
She is a royal princess .
Ay , and a subtle , as he most learnedly delivered .
O , come in , equivocator .
Ah , this thou shouldst have done And not have spoke on 't !
Oh , If you but knew how you the purpose cherish Whiles thus you mock it !
You are thought here to be the most senseless and fit man for the constable of the watch ; therefore bear you the lantern .
I myself could make A chough of as deep chat .
I assure my good liege , I hold my duty as I hold my soul , Both to my God and to my gracious king .
First kiss me , Kate , and we will .
Oh , villainous !
What means this jest ?
I must eat my dinner .
Here is the money .
There , sir , stop .
Tell me this , I pray : Where have you left the money that I gave you ?
I will run , fiend .
Most veritable , therefore look to 't well .
I think he be angry indeed .
Welcome .
Tis noble Kent , your friend .
We will .
There's no offense , my lord .
I am glad to see you well. , Horatio ?
And when he saw my best alarumed spirits , Bold in the quarrel's right , roused to the encounter , Or whether ghasted by the noise I made , Full suddenly he fled .
He'll say 'twas done cowardly , when he wakes .
I cry thee mercy , then , for I did think That thou hadst called me all these bitter names .
There is more sense in that than in reputation .
Well , I am glad that all things sort so well .
I have said .
Our duties , and the pledge .
He's gone , but his wife's killed .
He is the brooch indeed And gem of all the nation .
Is yonder the man ?
How comes this trick upon him ?
This is old .
I know not which is which .
Sweet lord , if your lordship were at leisure , I should impart a thing to you from His Majesty .
These late eclipses in the sun and moon portend no good to us .
And so he fell .
If you do free your children from the sword , Your children's children quits it in your age .
Then so much have I heard .
Ay , sir .
Then would to Heaven that I had never seen 't !
I would not see 't .
I do not well understand that .
Behind the arras I'll convey myself To hear the process .
I would I had been there .
Safe , Antony .
Antonio , I am married to a wife Which is as dear to me as life itself .
Quick , quick !
Thus says my king : "Say thou to Harry of England , though we seemed dead , we did but sleep .
The duke's to blame in this .
But here's a villain that would face me down He met me on the mart , and that I beat him And charged him with a thousand marks in gold , And that I did deny my wife and house. , Thou drunkard , thou , what didst thou mean by this ?
Friends , come hither .
Welcome , my lord .
Repair thy wit , good youth , or it will fall To cureless ruin .
He might have chid me so , for , in good faith , I am a child to chiding .
Ay , sir , it is too true , God help the while .
And here my mistress .
What , art thou afraid ?
Twas I that killed her .
Do you consent we shall acquaint him with it , As needful in our loves , fitting our duty ?
Come , more , another stanzo .
I pant for life .
Bar Harry England , that sweeps through our land With pennons painted in the blood of Harfleur .
But thy vile race , Though thou didst learn , had that in 't which good natures Could not abide to be with .
Come , my spade .
Ay , marry , why was he sent into England ?
Go to , go to .
Gentlemen both , we will not wake your patience .
A friendly eye could never see such faults .
Hast thou , spirit , Performed to point the tempest that I bade thee ?
I will be hanged , if some eternal villain , Some busy and insinuating rogue , Some cogging , cozening slave , to get some office , Have not devised this slander .
Get you to bed on th ' instant , I will be returned Forthwith .
A quarrel , but nothing wherefore .
Yes , one place else , if you will hear me name it .
Hark !
You shall have time to wrangle in when you have nothing else to do .
The sun doth gild our armor .
So quick bright things come to confusion .
Within my sword's length set him ; if he 'scape , Heaven forgive him too .
I pray you , father , being weak , seem so .
I would not be the villain that thou think'st For the whole space that's in the tyrant's grasp , And the rich East to boot .
The Duke in council ?
Speak .
I'll bear thy blame And take thy office from thee , on my peril .
If thou pleasest not , I yield thee up my life .
If not , elsewhere they meet with charity .
Where is he ?
Master young gentleman , I pray you , which is the way to Master Jew's ?
We must have your doublet and hose plucked over your head and show the world what the bird hath done to her own nest .
Within these two months , that's a month before This bond expires , I do expect return Of thrice three times the value of this bond .
Good Enobarbus , make yourself my guest Whilst you abide here .
Come they of noble family ?
See , see , our honored hostess !
A piece of ice .
The old man's daughter told us all .
We'll burn the house of Brutus .
My heart is ten times lighter than my looks .
Set it down .
And a true lover of the holy Church .
Would she had never given you leave to come !
I'll venture so much of my hawk or hound , But twenty times so much upon my wife .
If any ship put out , then straight away .
Such as she says my lord did say I was .
A howling monster , a drunken monster .
You must not look so sour .
Well , 'tis not so , my Lord High Constable .
Oh , well-a-day , Lady !
You have done well by water .
We'll mutiny .
Only for this , I pray you , pardon me .
O sir , fly this place .
When this burns , 'Twill weep for having wearied you .
Hold you content .
Ay , if your self's remembrance wrong yourself .
How now , my lord ?
Oh , she is Ten times more gentle than her father's crabbed , And he's composed of harshness .
It waves me forth again .
His spirits hear me And yet I needs must curse .
It is an accustomed action with her to seem thus washing her hands .
I can no more .
And I do think she's thirty .
So .
No , no , forsooth , I dare not for my life .
Give me thy hand .
Will they pursue the quality no longer than they can sing ?
At the duke's oak we meet .
I am ashamed I did yield to them .
O !
Sir , sir , be patient .
Now , as I am a Christian , answer me In what safe place you have bestowed my money , Or I shall break that merry sconce of yours That stands on tricks when I am undisposed .
Why , know'st thou any harm's intended towards him ?
I have broke with her father and his goodwill obtained .
What ceremony else ?
We will be satisfied !
False-boding woman , end thy frantic curse , Lest to thy harm thou move our patience .
I'll rather dwell in my necessity .
I know no ways to mince it in love , but directly to say , "I love you." Then if you urge me farther than to say , "Do you , in faith ? " I wear out my suit .
You cataracts and hurricanoes , spout Till you have drenched our steeples , drowned the cocks !
If I could add a lie unto a fault I would deny it .
What is your name ?
I am one , sir , that comes to tell you your daughter and the Moor are now making the beast with two backs .
But it is true , without any slips of prolixity or crossing the plain highway of talk , that the good Antonio , the honest Antonio , oh , that I had a title good enough to keep his name company ! , Come , the full stop .
For me , three thousand ducats .
Come now , what masques , what dances shall we have To wear away this long age of three hours Between our after-supper and bedtime ?
Signor Antonio ?
I am even The natural fool of fortune .
If you come slack of former services , You shall do well .
Most shallow man .
They would have me as familiar with men's pockets as their gloves or their handkerchers , which makes much against my manhood , if I should take from another's pocket to put into mine , for it is plain pocketing up of wrongs .
So is the dearest o ' th ' loss .
The King of Naples , being an enemy To me inveterate , hearkens my brother's suit , Which was that he , in lieu o ' th ' premises Of homage and I know not how much tribute , Should presently extirpate me and mine Out of the dukedom , and confer fair Milan With all the honors on my brother .
We will be married o ' Sunday .
News , lads , Our wars are done !
I know not what to say .
A good swift simile , but something currish .
What other bond Than secret Romans that have spoke the word And will not palter ?
Hark , how these instruments summon to supper .
The tempest in my mind Doth from my senses take all feeling else Save what beats there , filial ingratitude .
Let it not , Brutus .
Nay , good my lord , this courtesy is not of the right breed .
Because , look you , you do not love it , nor your affections and your appetites and your digestions does not agree with it , I would desire you to eat it .
There's five to one .
Make the doors upon a woman's wit , and it will out at the casement .
The fool will stay .
I do remember in this shepherd boy Some lively touches of my daughter's favor .
I'll know his humor when he knows his time .
Do so , good Messala .
They shall be apprehended by and by .
Certainly my conscience will serve me to run from this Jew , my master .
I charge you , get you home .
Quail , crush , conclude , and quell !
No .
It is not possible .
We should profane the service of the dead To sing a requiem and such rest to her As to peace-parted souls .
My soul shall thine keep company to heaven .
I thank thee , good Sir John , with all my heart .
Truly , young gentlemen , though there was no great matter in the ditty , yet the note was very untunable .
Let her not say 'tis I that keep you here .
Hark .
My cousin tells him in his ear that he is in her heart .
Know , my hearts , I hope well of tomorrow , and will lead you Where rather I'll expect victorious life Than death and honor .
And for Cassio , let me be his undertaker .
Here , noble lord .
Fare you well , my lord .
How many things by season seasoned are To their right praise and true perfection !
Come hither , good Volumnius .
Why , if thou never wast at court , thou never saw'st good manners ; if thou never saw'st good manners , then thy manners must be wicked , and wickedness is sin , and sin is damnation .
Into my grave .
What , have you writ that letter to my sister ?
I think that thou art just and think thou art not .
Thy evil spirit , Brutus .
Hie you to horse .
All three of them are desperate .
Till he come home again , I would forbear .
The ancient saying is no heresy .
Master , knock the door hard .
It's suppertime , my lord .
But while thou livest , keep a good tongue in thy head .
Sweet Moon , I thank thee for thy sunny beams .
We'll not run , Monsieur Monster .
None , but your beauty .
Where , my lord ?
O Cassius , if you could But win the noble Brutus to our party , Be you content .
Return with her ?
He tells me , my dear Gertrude , he hath found The head and source of all your son's distemper .
Dear Celia , I show more mirth than I am mistress of , and would you yet I were merrier ?
To plainness honor's bound When majesty falls to folly .
I took no more pains for those thanks than you take pains to thank me .
Tis but an hour ago since it was nine , And after one hour more 'twill be eleven .
Peace , you were best .
Let her be round with him , And I'll be placed , so please you , in the ear Of all their conference .
No hope that way is Another way so high a hope that even Ambition can not pierce a wink beyond , But doubt discovery there .
Some dear friend dead , else nothing in the world Could turn so much the constitution Of any constant man .
He should , for that , commit your godfathers .
Bring him , dead or living , Within this twelvemonth or turn thou no more To seek a living in our territory .
If I say sooth , I must report they were As cannons overcharged with double cracks , So they doubly redoubled strokes upon the foe .
And yet my sky shall not want .
I will reward thee Once for thy sprightly comfort and tenfold For thy good valor .
Know , sir , that I am called Hortensio .
I did very well note him .
I am not merry , but I do beguile The thing I am by seeming otherwise .
This is the very painting of your fear .
What should this mean ?
Ill luck , ill luck ?
Who will go with me ?
What he hath lost , noble Macbeth hath won .
Pray , have you not a daughter Called Katherina , fair and virtuous ?
And he that hath commanded is our king .
Go bid the priests do present sacrifice And bring me their opinions of success .
Bear with my weakness .
Upon my soul , a lie , a wicked lie .
What sayest thou , Biondello ?
Now have I done a good day's work .
Why ?
Let us be jocund .
Ay me !
We will have more of this tomorrow .
Royal Lear , Whom I have ever honored as my king , Loved as my father , as my master followed , As my great patron thought on in my prayers , The bow is bent and drawn .
I had rather be married to a death's-head with a bone in his mouth than to either of these .
And brief , good mother , for I am in haste .
When he is gone I would on great occasion speak with you .
Ah , Tranio , what a cruel father's he !
Wast thou not charged at peril , Wherefore to Dover ? , Let him first answer that .
More will I do , Though all that I can do is nothing worth , Since that my penitence comes after all , Imploring pardon .
The rarer action is In virtue than in vengeance .
Tis death to me to be at enmity ; I hate it , and desire all good men's love .
Therein our letters do not well agree .
My dearest love , Duncan comes here tonight .
If I be waspish , best beware my sting .
Thou hast forspoke my being in these wars And sayst it is not fit .
Thy father hath his life .
Thus may we gather honey from the weed And make a moral of the devil himself .
O , train me not , sweet mermaid , with thy note To drown me in thy sister's flood of tears .
Is now become a god , and Cassius is A wretched creature and must bend his body If Caesar carelessly but nod on him .
I hope so , Lepidus .
Tomorrow morning come you to my house , And since you could not be my son-in-law , Be yet my nephew .
First he denied you had in him no right .
How dost thou , Benedick , the married man ?
Saint Valentine is past .
I had a Richard too , and thou did'st kill him ; I had a Rutland too ; thou holp'st to kill him .
I have made no fault .
How doth the prince ?
It shall be to your good , for my father's house and all the revenue that was old Sir Rowland's will I estate upon you , and here live and die a shepherd .
Go with me To bless this twain that they may prosperous be , And honored in their issue .
Twas he informed against him , And quit the house on purpose that their punishment Might have the freer course .
He is coming .
Even so ?
The former Hero !
His forward voice now is to speak well of his friend .
If you will not , come when you are next prepared for .
What , my lord ?
And of the heat of the ginger .
Dear general , I never gave you cause .
And sometime lurk I in a gossip's bowl In very likeness of a roasted crab , And when she drinks , against her lips I bob And on her withered dewlap pour the ale .
Pluck up thy spirits .
She has deceived her father , and may thee .
Let go my hand .
I gave him no order .
O , make them joyful .
This is more strange Than such a murder is .
Ah , good Demetrius , wilt thou give him me ?
Give me mine armor .
Honest Iago Hath ta'en order for 't .
Statilius showed the torchlight but , my lord , He came not back .
But what's your will ?
Which is he that killed the deer ?
I have much to do But to go hang my head all at one side And sing it like poor Barbary .

Boy !
Most certain .
To eat us hungerly , and when they are full , They belch us .
Who did strike out the light ?
As a walled town is more worthier than a village , so is the forehead of a married man more honorable than the bare brow of a bachelor .
What noise is this ? , Not dead ?
When he returns from hunting , I will not speak with him .
Corinth first .
Our preparation stands In expectation of them .
Let his shames quickly Drive him to Rome .
Good madam , hear me .
You are deceived .
sits. , I did never think that lady would have loved any man .
And that which spites me more than all these wants , He does it under name of perfect love , As who should say , if I should sleep or eat , 'Twere deadly sickness or else present death .
I will say so .
Thou liest .
I speak not this that you should bear a good opinion of my knowledge , insomuch I say I know you are .
Do not fret yourself too much in the action , monsieur .
I dare say you love him not so ill to wish him here alone , howsoever you speak this to feel other men's minds .
From me he got it .
He sings at grave- making .
I do not know dat .
Or is your gold and silver ewes and rams ?
And for the Jew's bond which he hath of me , Let it not enter in your mind of love .
Tyranny is dead !
You heard her say herself it was not I .
Now sir , this granted , as it is a most pregnant and unforced position , who stands so eminent in the degree of this fortune as Cassio does ?
Dido and her Aeneas shall want troops , And all the haunt be ours. , Come , Eros , Eros !
I pray you , rise .
Where is Lucentio ?
Nay , I have done .
Therefore exhale .
Nay , certainly , I have heard the Ptolemies' pyramises are very goodly things .
Therefore speak softly .
Why have you stol'n upon us thus ?
I am alone the villain of the earth , And feel I am so most .
My lord , this would not be believed in Venice , Though I should swear I saw 't .
Will she go now to bed ?
Let fall thy blade on vulnerable crests ; I bear a charmed life , which must not yield To one of woman born .
My charge was but to fetch you from the mart Home to your house , the Phoenix , sir , to dinner .
Is your name Shylock ?
Advise your fellows so .
Thy love ?
Under this conjuration , speak , my lord , For we will hear , note , and believe in heart That what you speak is in your conscience washed As pure as sin with baptism .
I'll drink for you .
Out upon her !
I am a gentleman of blood and breeding , And from some knowledge and assurance offer This office to you .
What is my offense ?
When I think , I must speak .
The murmuring surge That on th ' unnumbered idle pebbles chafes Can not be heard so high .
Then , gentle brother , get you in again .
The villain is much lighter-heeled than I. I followed fast , but faster he did fly , That fallen am I in dark uneven way ,
Ay , my good lord .
Your plainness and your shortness please me well .
Why should she write to Edmund ?
Thou seest the world , Volumnius , how it goes .
Turn thee back , And tell thy king I do not seek him now But could be willing to march on to Calais Without impeachment , for , to say the sooth , Though 'tis no wisdom to confess so much Unto an enemy of craft and vantage , My people are with sickness much enfeebled , My numbers lessened , and those few I have Almost no better than so many French , Who when they were in health , I tell thee , herald , I thought upon one pair of English legs Did march three Frenchmen .
A certain aim he took At a fair vestal throned by the west , And loosed his love shaft smartly from his bow As it should pierce a hundred thousand hearts .
And did you leave him in this contemplation ?
If sanctimony and a frail vow betwixt an erring barbarian and supersubtle Venetian be not too hard for my wits and all the tribe of hell , thou shalt enjoy her .
Then bring me to their sights .
Before the time be out ?
Hamlet , thou art slain .
For God's sake , hold your hands .
I have full cause of weeping , but this heart Shall break into a hundred thousand flaws , Or ere I'll weep. , O Fool , I shall go mad !
But say , sir , is it dinnertime ?
And what's to come of my despised time Is naught but bitterness .
Each new morn New widows howl , new orphans cry , new sorrows Strike heaven on the face , that it resounds As if it felt with Scotland and yelled out Like syllable of dolor .
It is not lost , but what and if it were ?
No , my lord , unless I might have another for working days .
Go , Eros , send his treasure after .
So art thou to revenge when thou shalt hear .
You kill me to deny it .
Why , your lieutenant , Cassio .
Sitting on a bank , Weeping again the king my father's wrack , This music crept by me upon the waters , Allaying both their fury and my passion With its sweet air .
Your mind may change .
We should have else desired your good advice , Which still hath been both grave and prosperous , In this day's council , but we'll take tomorrow .
Did 't not wake you ?
For I will make him tell the tale anew Where , how , how oft , how long ago , and when He hath , and is again to cope your wife .
I should first tell thee how the Prince , Claudio and my master , planted and placed and possessed by my master Don John , saw afar off in the orchard this amiable encounter .
My bones would rest , That have but labored to attain this hour .
Let's lack no discipline , make no delay , For , lords , tomorrow is a busy day .
I have had four quarrels , and like to have fought one .
Thou worms ' meat in respect of a good piece of flesh , indeed .
You must not , sir , mistake my niece .
You said the enemy would not come down But keep the hills and upper regions .
Who steals my purse steals trash .
Not very well , but I have met him oft , And he hath bought the cottage and the bounds That the old carlot once was master of .
Madam , how like you this play ?
I thought so then , I'll kill myself for grief .
I will not sleep , my lord , till I have delivered your letter .
Did heaven look on , And would not take their part ?
Some villain hath done me wrong .
But yet , alas , stood I within his grace , I would prefer him to a better place .
Humh !
In my chamber window lies a book .
I partly feel thee .
I swear 'tis better to be much abused Than but to know 't a little .
Tis a good dullness , And give it way .
It were a delicate stratagem to shoe A troop of horse with felt .
When I have plucked thy rose I can not give it vital growth again , It must needs wither .
I care not .
It were a better death than die with mocks , Which is as bad as die with tickling .
He kills her in her own humor .
I to the world am like a drop of water That in the ocean seeks another drop , Who , falling there to find his fellow forth , Unseen , inquisitive , confounds himself .
You shall advise me in all for Cleopatra .
Well , again .
I would my horse had the speed of your tongue and so good a continuer .
You , Nick Bottom , are set down for Pyramus .
That , sir , which I will not report after her .
There will she hide her To listen our propose .
I have them ready .
Wine loved I deeply , dice dearly , and in woman outparamoured the Turk .
For them all together , which maintained so politic a state of evil that they will not admit any good part to intermingle with them .
In Kent , my liege , the Guilfords are in arms , And every hour more competitors Flock to the rebels , and their power grows strong .
Keep thou the left .
Is it not like the king ?
That ever holds .
Ay me !
As proper men as ever trod upon neat's leather have gone upon my handiwork .
I'll devil-porter it no further .
Let me see .
How is 't with you , my most fair Bianca ?
Will you not tell me who told you so ?
O , sir , the conceit is deeper than you think for .
But oh , poor Gloucester , Lost he his other eye ?
Mend your speech a little , Lest you may mar your fortunes .
I can not make you what amends I would ; Therefore accept such kindness as I can .
Sir , they are spoken , and these things are true .
Besides , I ha ' not since put up my sword , Against the Capitol I met a lion , Who glared upon me and went surly by , Without annoying me .
Is this the Prince ?
Would he not be a comfort to our travel ?
Not so , neither .
And how cam'st thou hither ?
Welcome , Publius .
Thanks for that .
Adieu , noble Agrippa .
Come , my lord , and in our flight Tell me how it came this night That I sleeping here was found With these mortals on the ground .
At land , thou know'st How much we do o'ercount thee .
Behold how like a maid she blushes here !
But soft !
Unless he have a fancy to this foolery , as it appears he hath , he is no fool for fancy , as you would have it appear he is .
The boy was the very staff of my age , my very prop .
We do not know .
Besides , old Gremio is heark'ning still , And happily we might be interrupted .
Now I begin : Imprimis , we came down a foul hill , my master riding behind my mistress , Both of one horse ?
We defy augury .
Ay , are you thereabouts ?
Are they so followed ?
Of it own color too .
Nor I neither , by this heavenly light .
Now , Catesby , what says his grace ?
Now sit we close about this taper here And call in question our necessities .
And here will rest me .
Tell him I'll knock his leek about his pate Upon Saint Davy's day .
What do you mean ?
In both my eyes he doubly sees himself , In each eye , one .
Speak no more of him ; you'll be whipped for taxation one of these days .
Art rich ?
By my troth , my lord , I can not tell what to think of it , but that she loves him with an enraged affection , it is past the infinite of thought .
No more .
The time 'twixt six and now Must by us both be spent most preciously .
Make good room .
Therefore prepare you .
What foul play had we that we came from thence ?
And what of all this ?
I know that we shall have him well to friend .
Not for Cadwallader and all his goats .
No more , I pray thee .
It might , my lord .
We must starve our sight From lovers ' food till morrow deep midnight .
Therefore our everlasting farewell take .
Youth to itself rebels , though none else near .
Hoppedance cries in Tom's belly for two white herring .
Fall not a tear , I say .
Then must the Jew be merciful .
I shall .
Will not King Richard let me speak with him ?
Weapons , arms ?
Nay , get thee gone .
Pronounce .
I'll yield him thee asleep , Where thou mayst knock a nail into his head .
That can not be , since I am still possessed Of those effects for which I did the murder : My crown , mine own ambition , and my queen .
Are you his brother ?
I pray you , sir , take patience .
Caesar , I bring thee word Menecrates and Menas , famous pirates , Make the sea serve them , which they ear and wound With keels of every kind .
Stay till I have read the letter .
This broken joint between you and her husband entreat her to splinter , and , my fortunes against any lay worth naming , this crack of your love shall grow stronger than it was before .
My lord ?
That's my brave lord !
I am very proud , revengeful , ambitious , with more offences at my beck than I have thoughts to put them in , imagination to give them shape , or time to act them in .
Your gentleness shall force More than your force move us to gentleness .
For shame , put on your gown .
Why seek'st thou me ?
Yonder sure they are coming .
Where is thy master , Dromio ?
Woo't tear thyself ?
And cries aloud , "Tarry , my cousin Suffolk .
Is my lord well , that he doth speak so wide ?
Hath homely age th ' alluring beauty took From my poor cheek ?
My noble lord , What dost thou say , Iago ?
It is the blessed sun .
Now all is well .
We shall be the more marketable. , Bonjour , Monsieur Le Beau .
You , Roderigo !
She's busy , and she can not come ! " Is that an answer ?
Indeed , they say the senators tomorrow Mean to establish Caesar as a king , And he shall wear his crown by sea and land In every place save here in Italy .
Soft stillness and the night Become the touches of sweet harmony .
When shall we come to th ' top of that same hill ?
He's in his fit now and does not talk after the wisest .
Ha !
Bring her to try wi ' th ' main course .
Ah , Luciana , did he tempt thee so ?
You must away tonight .
He is welcome too .
What , I say ?
I could find in my heart to beat him , But that the poor monster's in drink .
To thine and Albany's issue Be this perpetual. , What says our second daughter , Our dearest Regan , wife of Cornwall ?
Speak to me what thou art .
I'll be thy second .
Silver .
Madam , I had rather seal my lips Than to my peril speak that which is not .
He said the truth .
Where is the fellow ?
What would my potent master ?
Truly , a peck of provender .
Many hot inroads They make in Italy , the borders maritime Lack blood to think on 't , and flush youth revolt .
Then , in the name of God and all these rights , Advance your standards .
Madam , undress you and come now to bed .
I know not , Menas , How lesser enmities may give way to greater .
Why , go to then .
Where's thy conscience now ?
Welcome , good Robin .
Was 't you that did so oft contrive to kill him ?
That's mercy , but too much security .
Had our general Been what he knew himself , it had gone well .
Well , well , well .
Show me which way .
Post back with speed , and tell him what hath chanced .
So let high-sighted tyranny range on Till each man drop by lottery .
No .
He's coming hither , now , i ' th ' night , i ' th ' haste , And Regan with him .
Time shall unfold what plighted cunning hides , Who covers faults at last with shame derides .
Tomorrow will we be married .
Sweet Phoebe , do not scorn me .
Is 't possible ?
The flat transgression of a schoolboy who , being overjoyed with finding a birds ' nest , shows it his companion , and he steals it .
No , truly , but in friendly recompense .
Never king of England Had nobles richer , and more loyal subjects , Whose hearts have left their bodies here in England And lie pavilioned in the fields of France .
You shall hear more by midnight .
Most heathenish and most gross !
Hound or spaniel , brach or him , Bobtail tyke or trundle-tail , Tom will make them weep and wail .
What infinite heart's ease Must kings neglect that private men enjoy ?
But ere we could arrive the point proposed , Caesar cried , "Help me , Cassius , or I sink ! " I , as Aeneas , our great ancestor , Did from the flames of Troy upon his shoulder The old Anchises bear , so from the waves of Tiber Did I the tired Caesar .
Nor stony tower , nor walls of beaten brass , Nor airless dungeon , nor strong links of iron Can be retentive to the strength of spirit .
Horatio , thou art e'en as just a man As e'er my conversation coped withal .
What mean you , madam ?
He , for his father's sake , so loves the prince That he will not be won to aught against him .
Wouldst thou have that Which thou esteem'st the ornament of life , And live a coward in thine own esteem , Letting "I dare not" wait upon "I would , " Like the poor cat i ' th ' adage ?
I am very glad to see you .
A parlous boy !
I'll run from thee and hide me in the brakes , And leave thee to the mercy of wild beasts .
In Syracusa was I born , and wed Unto a woman happy but for me , And by me , had not our hap been bad .
Wast ever in court , shepherd ?
I here do give thee that with all my heart Which , but thou hast already , with all my heart I would keep from thee .
I will , my lord .
Truly then I fear you are damned both by father and mother .
I will not have to do with you .
Oh , that we now had here But one ten thousand of those men in England That do no work today .
On Tuesday noon , or night , or Wednesday morn .
Soft !
And bid her come hither .
How's the day ?
Who knows if Donalbain be with his brother ?
And so , adieu .
Signior Baptista , you are happily met. , Sir , this is the gentleman I told you of .
We have not made good preparation .
Be lion-mettled , proud , and take no care Who chafes , who frets , or where conspirers are .
And smelt so ?
Come , thou mortal wretch , With thy sharp teeth this knot intrinsicate Of life at once untie .
You are dull , Casca , and those sparks of life That should be in a Roman you do want , Or else you use not .
Breathe Merriman , the poor cur is embossed , And couple Clowder with the deep-mouthed brach .
Learn of the wise and perpend : civet is of a baser birth than tar , the very uncleanly flux of a cat .
Shall I keep your hogs and eat husks with them ?
Tis now the very witching time of night , When churchyards yawn and hell itself breathes out Contagion to this world .
Then burst his mighty heart , And , in his mantle muffling up his face , Even at the base of Pompey's statue , Which all the while ran blood , great Caesar fell .
O , that thou wert not , poor distressed soul !
She for an Edward weeps , and so do I ; I for a Clarence weep ; so doth not she .
The gates of mercy shall be all shut up , And the fleshed soldier , rough and hard of heart , In liberty of bloody hand , shall range With conscience wide as hell , mowing like grass Your fresh fair virgins and your flow'ring infants .
Come , one for me .
I greet thy love Not with vain thanks but with acceptance bounteous , And will upon the instant put thee to 't .
Some to Ligarius ' .
Come , come , do you think I do not know you by your excellent wit ?
And be not easily won to our requests .
Good my lord , You have been a boggler ever .
To take the widow Exasperates , makes mad her sister Goneril , And hardly shall I carry out my side , Her husband being alive .
A good direction , warlike sovereign .
Sir , I shall study deserving .
Something , sure , of state , Either from Venice , or some unhatched practice Made demonstrable here in Cyprus to him , Hath puddled his clear spirit , and in such cases Men's natures wrangle with inferior things , Though great ones are their object .
My lord , you shall o'errule my mind for once. , Come on , Lord Hastings , will you go with me ?
Why is this reasoned ?
Murder most foul , as in the best it is .
And liegemen to the Dane .
O Ratcliffe , I have dreamed a fearful dream !
My liege and madam , to expostulate What majesty should be , what duty is , Why day is day , night night , and time is time , Were nothing but to waste night , day , and time .
Seyton !
We will ourselves provide .
Decius , go tell them Caesar will not come .
Why then , you are in love .
I will , lady .
But a harsh hearing when women are froward .
And to that end , sir , I will welcome you .
Prithee , peace .
Fare you well .
Now , by this hand , I swear , I scorn the term , Nor shall my Nell keep lodgers .
Tonight I'll mourn with Hero .
Infect her beauty , You fen-sucked fogs drawn by the powerful sun , To fall and blister !
But , sir , here comes your boy .
Thanks to your majesty .
Comes Caesar to the Capitol tomorrow ?
I would I had your bond , for I perceive A weak bond holds you .
But after many ceremonies done , He calls for wine .
Trow you whither I am going ?
Wherefore rejoice ?
Be 't as our gods will have 't .
Let him approach .
O my dear Orlando , how it grieves me to see thee wear thy heart in a scarf .
Sound , music ! , Come , my queen , take hands with me , And rock the ground whereon these sleepers be .
Sirrah , naked fellow , Poor Tom's a-cold .
Tis dangerous when the baser nature comes Between the pass and fell incensed points Of mighty opposites .
Ay , my good lord .
But what trade art thou ?
Now , the next day Was our sea fight , and what to this was sequent Thou know'st already .
For this slave , If there be any cunning cruelty That can torment him much and hold him long , It shall be his .
I arrest thee of high treason , by the name of Thomas Grey , knight , of Northumberland .
His name !
He will , an if he live to be a man .
If I could pray to move , prayers would move me .
No .
I know that voice .
Go not my horse the better , I must become a borrower of the night For a dark hour or twain .
And she is mine , and all my right of her I do estate unto Demetrius .
How should that be ?
It was not brought me , my lord .
Betrayed I am .
Spake you with him ?
Your accent is something finer than you could purchase in so removed a dwelling .
I'll rest .
The letters that he speaks of May be my friends .
He brushes his hat o ' mornings .
No , and swears she never will .
Your daughter spent in Genoa , as I heard , in one night fourscore ducats .
Nay , but swear 't .
But she is none .
Well , Jessica , go in .
A hit , a very palpable hit .
Why , what should be the fear ?
If you be gentlemen , Do me this right : hear me with patience .
Here's the manner of 't : I' th' marketplace , on a tribunal silvered , Cleopatra and himself in chairs of gold Were publicly enthroned .
If thy greatness will Revenge it on him , for I know thou darest , But this thing dare not , That's most certain .
What ho , the Emperor's guard !
False face must hide what the false heart doth know .
O time's extremity , Hast thou so crack'd and splitted my poor tongue In seven short years that here my only son Knows not my feeble key of untuned cares ?
But that thy strange mutations make us hate thee , Life would not yield to age .
A southwest blow on ye And blister you all o'er !
I have been worth the whistle .
We are resolved , my lord .
Pardon not that .
A mighty strength they carry .
So will it , madam till I lie with you .
Myself have letters of the selfsame tenor .
Time calls upon 's .
I one , my lord .
Upon such sacrifices , my Cordelia , The gods themselves throw incense .
Most noble sir , arise .
What thou wouldst do Is done unto thy hand .
And I'll be wise hereafter And seek for grace .
God keep your Ladyship still in that mind , so some gentle- man or other shall 'scape a predestinate scratched face .
Confess and love" Had been the very sum of my confession .
Lead me to my chamber .
Thou art a strange fellow .
Oh , it offends me to the soul to hear a robustious periwig-pated fellow tear a passion to tatters , to very rags , to split the ears of the groundlings , who for the most part are capable of nothing but inexplicable dumb-shows and noise .
Come , sweet Audrey .
My purposes do draw me much about .
By so much the more shall I tomorrow be at the height of heart-heaviness , by how much I shall think my brother happy in having what he wishes for .
What's this ?
Peace , peace !
By and by .
He shall not go to prison .
I swear to thee , youth , by the white hand of Rosalind , I am that he , that unfortunate he .
The sight is dismal , And our affairs from England come too late .
I can not speak your England .
I'll leave thee Now like a man of steel .
Save means to live .
Nay , for a need , thus far come near my person : Tell them when that my mother went with child Of that insatiate Edward , noble York My princely father then had wars in France , And , by true computation of the time , Found that the issue was not his begot , Which well appeared in his lineaments , Being nothing like the noble duke my father .
What , not to pray ?
Beat me ?
I am in your debt for your last exercise .
My noble father , I do perceive here a divided duty .
He will keep that good name still .
For all the rest , They'll take suggestion as a cat laps milk .
Still be 't yours .
Some tardy cripple bear the countermand , That came too lag to see him buried .
She has spoke what she should not , I am sure of that .
What , An advocate for an imposter ?
But why , why , why ?
If any , speak , for him have I offended .
Come , shall we fall to work ?
Help , help , help !
Ay .
The powers of the kingdom approach apace .
Swear by my sword Never to speak of this that you have heard .
Think you I am no stronger than my sex , Being so fathered and so husbanded ?
What sense had I in her stol'n hours of lust ?
Not to kill him , having a warrant , but to be damned for killing him , from the which no warrant can defend me .
Oh , yet I do repent me of my fury , That I did kill them .
Not we .
A poor unfortunate beggar .
Yet thou didst kill my children .
O , let me think on Hastings and be gone To Brecknock , while my fearful head is on !
Oh , coward that I am , to live so long To see my best friend ta'en before my face !
I pray you , let me look upon the bond .
But I can tell why a snail has a house .
My lord , my lord , I will not hear you .
I have this present evening from my sister Been well informed of them , and with such cautions That if they come to sojourn at my house I'll not be there .
Ay , past all surgery .
And thought they Margaret was Hero ?
This doth betoken The corse they follow did with desperate hand Fordo its own life .
My charity is outrage , life my shame , And in that shame still live my sorrows ' rage .
Go with me and see What I can show in this .
Therefore know I have earned of Don John a thousand ducats .
How fares your majesty ?
If you choose that , then I am yours withal .
I am half afeard Thou wilt say anon he is some kin to thee , Thou spend'st such high-day wit in praising him. , Come , come , Nerissa , for I long to see Quick Cupid's post that comes so mannerly .
All this is so , but what of this , my lord ?
Why , then , I care not for thee .
Ay , his breast .
I know it well , sir .
Is there division 'twixt my lord and Cassio ?
Speak .
I thank it .
What is thy name ?
I'll go arm myself .
Yea , but so I am apt to do myself wrong .
I am feared in field and town .
Phoebe , with all my heart .
Oh , how I long to have some chat with her !
In such a night To shut me out !
I'll tell thee , Aliena , I can not be out of the sight of Orlando .
Knock , knock , knock !
No messenger but thine , and all alone Tonight we'll wander through the streets and note The qualities of people .
Nay , we will slink away in supper time , Disguise us at my lodging , and return , All in an hour .
What shall I know of thee ?
And I remember the wooing of a peascod instead of her , from whom I took two cods and , giving her them again , said with weeping tears , "Wear these for my sake." We that are true lovers run into strange capers .
Free from the bondage you are in , Messala .
Give me mine angle .
Now , I prithee , daughter , do not make me mad .
I met this man with my glove in his cap , and I have been as good as my word .
How satisfied , my lord ?
Who is 't that cried ?
How fondly dost thou reason !
Peace , fool .
Mistress , that you know .
Where is Antony ?
Out of their saddles into the dirt , and thereby hangs a tale .
You , constable , are to present the Prince's own person .
I will to Egypt .
On .
No , no , we will hold it as a dream till it appear itself .
Caesar hath sent , Too slow a messenger .
Go , get thee gone , I say .
I will be heard .
Tis very true .
What three things does drink especially provoke ?
O wherefore , Nature , didst thou lions frame ?
Farewell , good Signior Love .
It seems that you scorn me .
Down , and swear .
When went there by an age , since the great flood , But it was famed with more than with one man ?
Your servants ever Have theirs , themselves , and what is theirs in compt , To make their audit at your highness ' pleasure , Still to return your own .
Mean you to enjoy him then ?
Why then , lead on .
Th' art an honest man .
The mobled queen" ?
Not I , my lord , by heaven .
But you , my honorable lords , may name the time , And in the duke's behalf I'll give my voice , Which I presume he'll take in gentle part .
Stay , you imperfect speakers , tell me more .
Look to the lady .
How now , daughter and cousin ?
We know each other's faces ; for our hearts , He knows no more of mine than I of yours , Or I of his , my lord , than you of mine. , Lord Hastings , you and he are near in love .
Ay , or drinking , fencing , swearing , Quarreling , drabbing , you may go so far .
The fiend is strong within him .
Thou torturest me , Tubal .
Take heed o ' th ' foul fiend .
But I must tell thee plainly , Claudio undergoes my challenge , and either I must shortly hear from him , or I will subscribe him a coward .
I am a king , my masters , know you that ?
But sure the bravery of his grief did put me Into a towering passion .
Pluck them asunder .
Let your epilogue alone .
And his kissing is as full of sanctity as the touch of holy bread .
The Duke himself , Or any of my brothers of the state , Can not but feel this wrong as 'twere their own .
I had rather be a toad And live upon the vapor of a dungeon Than keep a corner in the thing I love For others ' uses .
He fears , my lord , you mean no good to him .
So God sa ' me , 'tis shame to stand still .
What news ?
Welcome to Rome .
What do they in the north When they should serve their sovereign in the west ?
Had I as many sons as I have hairs , I would not wish them to a fairer death .
Good friend , be gone .
The matter ?
She's like a liar gone to burning hell .
Why , how now , Adam ?
Who comes here ?
I see thy age and dangers make thee dote .
Here on her breast There is a vent of blood , and something blown .
Tis like a demi-cannon .
Was ever man so 'rayed ?
Signior ?
If there were no more women but Fulvia , then had you indeed a cut , and the case to be lamented .
Foolish wench , To th ' most of men this is a Caliban And they to him are angels .
We'll have thee , as our rarer monsters are , Painted on a pole , and underwrit , "Here may you see the tyrant." I will not yield , To kiss the ground before young Malcolm's feet , And to be baited with the rabble's curse .
The Moor already changes with my poison .
Men that hazard all Do it in hope of fair advantages .
Dolabella !
Hide it in smiles and affability .
To which we all appeal .
So you shall .
She shall , Lucentio .
Sit you too .
For this , be sure , tonight thou shalt have cramps , Side-stitches that shall pen thy breath up .
That I disdain .
What would you with her , sir ?
No , no , they would not .
Why , but there's many a man hath more hair than wit .
Ay .
Brutus killed me .
Good morrow , both .
So will you wish on me when the rash mood is on .
Yet my heart Throbs to know one thing .
I have made strong proof of my constancy , Giving myself a voluntary wound Here in the thigh .
But I do prophesy the election lights On Fortinbras .
By this leek , I will most horribly revenge .
No ?
No .
Thou art armed , Gloucester .
What , dost thou scorn me for my gentle counsel , And soothe the devil that I warn thee from ?
Do you intend to stay with me tonight ?
The one , to save the money that he spends in tiring ; the other , that at dinner they should not drop in his porridge .
Or any of your faction ?
I heard it not .
Avoid , and leave him .
Bring him away .
For a little Follow , and do me service .
When I desire their leave that I might pity him , they took from me the use of mine own house , charged me on pain of their perpetual displeasure neither to speak of him , entreat for him , nor any way sustain him .
Heavens keep him from these beasts !
The nature of bad news infects the teller .
I feel this pinprick .
Do not you love me ?
You see me here , you gods , a poor old man , As full of grief as age , wretched in both .
Turn up on your right hand at the next turning , but at the next turning of all on your left .
Still did I tell him it was vile and bad .
Poor painted queen , vain flourish of my fortune , Why strew'st thou sugar on that bottled spider , Whose deadly web ensnareth thee about ?
Hoo !
An abominable monster !
I have myself resolved upon a course Which has no need of you .
To none but thee , no more but when to thee .
Your Majesty shall mock at me .
I will hear that play .
I know you could not lack , I am certain on 't , Very necessity of this thought , that I , Your partner in the cause 'gainst which he fought , Could not with graceful eyes attend those wars Which fronted mine own peace .
I can not hide what I am .
Should be" , should buzz !
Disloyal ?
Was my father a traitor , Mother ?
On a trice , so please you , Even in a dream were we divided from them And were brought moping hither .
What , you look merrily .
He can not prevail with me .
I would thou couldst stammer , that thou might'st pour this concealed man out of thy mouth as wine comes out of a narrow-mouthed bottle , either too much at once , or none at all .
O ill-starred wench , Pale as thy smock !
Why , then , some be of laughing , as , ah , ha , he !
Your man and you are marvelous merry , sir .
Yes , by Saint Patrick , but there is , Horatio , And much offense too .
You are early stirring .
O my son , my son !
You know sometimes he walks four hours together Here in the lobby .
What dost thou profess ?
Love ?
This fortification , gentlemen , shall we see 't ?
Poor heart , adieu .
Why , God will send more , if the man will be thankful .
That if you be honest and fair , your honesty should admit no discourse to your beauty .
There is so much that thou wilt kill me straight .
Will you have some more sauce to your leek ?
And died so ?
How dost thou ?
I am sure you both of you remember me .
To do this is within the compass of man's wit , and therefore I will attempt the doing it .
Away !
The old cock .
Nay , rather persuade him to hold his hands .
Why , you speak like an ancient and most quiet watchman , for I can not see how sleeping should offend .
Then never man was man true .
She is never sad but when she sleeps , and not ever sad then , for I have heard my daughter say she hath often dreamed of unhappiness and waked herself with laughing .
Have you no modesty , no maiden shame , No touch of bashfulness ?
Tis neither here nor there .
That's one of them .
Oh , most lame and impotent conclusion !
I will look him and privily relieve him .
She Is daughter to this famous Duke of Milan , Of whom so often I have heard renown But never saw before , of whom I have Received a second life .
One word , sir .
But do not look for further recompense Than thine own gladness that thou art employed .
That's as we list to grace him .
At last , a little shaking of mine arm And thrice his head thus waving up and down , He raised a sigh so piteous and profound As it did seem to shatter all his bulk And end his being .
What's the matter ?
I never did her any , to my knowledge .
I think this tale would win my daughter too .
If you will patiently dance in our round And see our moonlight revels , go with us .
Hear me , good brother , Under your pardon .
Is 't possible ?
Answer every man directly .
What might import my sister's letter to him ?
There was more foolery yet , if I could remember it .
Wouldst thou give 'em all ?
Wonder not till further warrant .
She gave it him , and he hath given it his whore .
And I will sing it in the latter end of a play before the duke .
Here's his dry hand up and down .
I know him to be valiant .
Thus bad begins and worse remains behind .
Oh , that I were a man for his sake !
Lord Hamlet , Heaven secure him !
This is the foul fiend Flibbertigibbet .
The good years shall devour them , flesh and fell , Ere they shall make us weep .
This the Dauphin speaks .
I will expect you .
Six or seven thousand is their utmost power .
What , are you hurt , lieutenant ?
Cousins , I hope the days are near at hand That chambers will be safe .
You shall mark Many a duteous and knee-crooking knave That ( doting on his own obsequious bondage ) Wears out his time much like his master's ass For naught but provender , and when he's old , cashiered .
And you shall speak In the same pulpit whereto I am going , After my speech is ended .
Tyrants themselves wept when it was reported .
Some innocents 'scape not the thunderbolt .
A velvet dish !
Yet Benedick was such another , and now is he become a man .
Why , what's the matter ?
There be some such , no question .
Thou think'st 'tis much that this contentious storm Invades us to the skin .
To both their deaths shalt thou be accessory .
Prithee , if thou lovest me , tell me .
I could not forget you , for I never saw you before in all my life .
And came I not at last to comfort you ?
How now , my noble friend ?
If ever thou come to me and say , after tomorrow , "This is my glove , " by this hand I will take thee a box on the ear .
Well , then , that's the humor of 't .
There lock yourself and send him word you are dead .
Here you may roast your goose .
Good madam , be not angry with the child .
You advise me well .
That by proscription and bills of outlawry , Octavius , Antony , and Lepidus Have put to death an hundred senators .
This is a sleepy tune .
But I confess , sir , that we were locked out .
Pray you , away .
No , not an oath .
Live a little , comfort a little , cheer thyself a little .
The beds i' th' East are soft , and thanks to you , That called me timelier than my purpose hither , For I have gained by 't .
As strange as the thing I know not .
And if it sort not well , you may conceal her , As best befits her wounded reputation , In some reclusive and religious life , Out of all eyes , tongues , minds , and injuries .
Woo't thou fight well ?
Nay , then , Well , well , th ' event .
And shall I couple hell ?
In her consists my happiness and thine .
I took him sleeping , that is finished too , And the Athenian woman by his side , That , when he waked , of force she must be eyed .
No port is free , no place That guard and most unusual vigilance Does not attend my taking .
There is , there is .
Twas a sweet marriage , and we prosper well in our return .
Shall 't be tonight at supper ?
Good morrow to thee .
I never heard So musical a discord , such sweet thunder .
Here comes the king , The queen , the courtiers , who is this they follow , And with such maimed rites ?
Hear it not , Duncan , for it is a knell That summons thee to heaven or to hell .
That ever I should call thee castaway !
The concavities of it is not sufficient , for , look you , th ' athversary , you may discuss unto the duke , look you , is digt himself four yard under the countermines .
Where is Lysander and fair Hermia ?
It hath been taught us from the primal state That he which is was wished until he were , And the ebbed man , ne'er loved till ne'er worth love , Comes deared by being lacked .
He knows not the stop .
Approach and speak .
She was a vixen when she went to school .
Is this the monument of Leonato ?
Fare thee well !
On Fortune's cap we are not the very button .
Upon what cause ?
Not i ' th ' stocks , fool .
Good morrow to your Worship .
Speak low if you speak love .
I myself .
Curse not thyself , fair creature ; thou art both .
Help , Charmian , help , Iras , help !
Hear the shrill whistle , which doth order give To sounds confused .
I am changed .
There is but one mind in all these men , and it is bent against Caesar .
I'll pull thee by the lesser legs .
Wilt thou be pleased to hearken once again to the suit I made to thee ?
O sun , thy uprise shall I see no more .
Slanders , sir .
I would be friends with you and have your love , Forget the shames that you have stained me with , Supply your present wants and take no doit Of usance for my moneys , and you'll not hear me !
Go forth , Agrippa , and begin the fight .
Old lord , I can not blame thee , Who am myself attached with weariness To th ' dulling of my spirits .
Oh , that exceeds , they say .
Come , my lord .
Here Catesby comes again .
This day , great duke , she shut the doors upon me While she with harlots feasted in my house .
Twas on a summer's evening in his tent , That day he overcame the Nervii .
Ay , with a twink .
This you should pity rather than despise .
For mine own part , no offence to the general nor any man of quality , I hope to be saved .
This courtesy , forbid thee , shall the duke Instantly know , and of that letter too .
Let us seek out some desolate shade and there Weep our sad bosoms empty .
I bespoke it not .
He's a traitor .
Such unconstant starts are we like to have from him as this of Kent's banishment .
My mistress and her sister stays for you .
Tis time that I were gone .
This avarice Sticks deeper , grows with more pernicious root Than summer-seeming lust , and it hath been The sword of our slain kings .
But till this afternoon his passion Ne'er brake into extremity of rage .
Get thee to bed .
I long with all my heart to see the prince .
If thou hadst feared to break an oath by Him , Th ' imperial metal circling now thy head Had graced the tender temples of my child , And both the princes had been breathing here , Which now , two tender bedfellows for dust , Thy broken faith hath made the prey for worms .
I not doubt He came alive to land .
I am sorry thou wilt leave my father so .
What , Grumio !
Grace grow where those drops fall !
There let him sink , and be the seas on him !
Certain , men should be what they seem .
By this sword , I will .
Say it is done , And I will love thee and prefer thee for it .
To thee a woman's services are due .
Look , here comes a walking fire .
Made you no more offense but what you speak of ?
More of this matter can not I report .
She says you have some goodly jest in hand .
Witness you That he is borne about invisible .
But I had rather fast from all four days Than drink so much in one .
Brutus , a word with you .
True !
If you have lost him , Why , I have lost him too .
To threaten me with death is most unlawful .
Look where she comes .
But how , but how ?
You are welcome to Elsinore .
We'll hear the will .
As a friend or an enemy ?
To what end , my lord ?
And here much Orlando .
One word more .
Whom should I knock ?
Mad call I it , for , to define true madness , What is 't but to be nothing else but mad ?
Better be with the dead , Whom we , to gain our peace , have sent to peace , Than on the torture of the mind to lie In restless ecstasy .
Gentlemen , rise .
Follow me not .
No more .
Chid I for that at frugal Nature's frame ?
Either be patient and entreat me fair , Or with the clamorous report of war Thus will I drown your exclamations .
Therefore be patient .
It shall be done .
You are he , you are he .
I ' faith , coz , 'tis he .
The one the other poisoned for my sake , And after slew herself .
Two hundred ducats .
Mine ear must pluck it thence .
Tom will throw his head at them. , Avaunt , you curs !
Two nights together had these gentlemen , Marcellus and Barnardo , on their watch , In the dead waste and middle of the night , Been thus encountered : a figure like your father , Armed at point exactly , cap-a-pie , Appears before them and with solemn march Goes slow and stately by them .
Brother John Bates , is not that the morning which breaks yonder ?
Talk not to me .
O monstrous world !
That will I , Pompey .
If she and I be pleased , what's that to you ?
Dispatch. , Enobarbus !
He lays it on .
trick up with new-tuned oaths ; and what a beard of the general's cut and a horrid suit of the camp will do among foaming bottles and ale-washed wits is wonderful to be thought on .
I pray thee , bear my former answer back .
What bastard doth not ?
Well , praised be the gods for thy foulness ; sluttishness may come hereafter .
I pray you tell me .
So befall my soul As this is false he burdens me withal .
As thou got'st Milan , I'll come by Naples .
How if fair and foolish ?
I am hers .
My sovereign lord , I do beseech your Highness To take our brother Clarence to your grace .
We would so , and then go a-batfowling .
On , on , you noblest English , Whose blood is fet from fathers of war-proof , Fathers that , like so many Alexanders , Have in these parts from morn till even fought And sheathed their swords for lack of argument .
Stood the state so ?
I know not that , when he knows what I know .
I stumbled when I saw .
When were you wont to be so full of songs , sirrah ?
Now entertain conjecture of a time When creeping murmur and the poring dark Fills the wide vessel of the universe .
I am a spirit of no common rate .
The moon is down .
For a taste : If a hart do lack a hind , Let him seek out Rosalind .
One from the Lord Stanley .
The heart is sorely charged .
I do suffer love indeed , for I love thee against my will .
Marry , at the very next turning turn of no hand , but turn down indirectly to the Jew's house .
Since my young lady's going into France , sir , the fool hath much pined away .
My quaint Ariel , Hark in thine ear .
It makes us , or it mars us .
Yes , they have .
He is composed and framed of treachery , And fled he is upon this villainy .
Who's that ?
I have two nights watched with you but can perceive no truth in your report .
Good my lord , give me thy favor still .
Therefore , fair Hermia , question your desires .
What shall become of this ?
Master , master !
Begone .
Your Honor's players , hearing your amendment , Are come to play a pleasant comedy , For so your doctors hold it very meet , Seeing too much sadness hath congealed your blood , And melancholy is the nurse of frenzy .
Answer me in one word .
Let's see .
I pardon that man's life .
Is 't far you ride ?
What hath he said ?
Give ear , sir , to my sister .
Then 'tis most like The sovereignty will fall upon Macbeth .
Conduct me to mine host .
You have little cause to say so .
Have you the chain about you ?
And thou , all-shaking thunder , Smite flat the thick rotundity o ' th ' world , Crack nature's molds , all germens spill at once That make ingrateful man !
Dost thou not suspect my place ?
He shall do this , or else I do recant The pardon that I late pronounced here .
Shall not be long but I'll be here again .
Go you and prepare Aliena , for look you , here comes my Rosalind .
Go with me , Silvius .
Well aimed of such a young one .
This may prove food to my displeasure .
Look , here she comes .
Where is he ?
Not a mouse stirring .
To bed , to bed .
Were I my father , coz , would I do this ?
I pray you , Let not my jealousies be your dishonors , But mine own safeties .
Out and alas , that was my lady's voice .
How now , my lord !
Gods and goddesses , All the whole synod of them !
Dat it is not be de fashion pour les ladies of France , I can not tell wat is To kiss .
Give me thy hand .
That will I , should I die the hour after .
Which of you trembles not that looks on me ?
Their mastiffs are of unmatchable courage .
Are there no stones in heaven But what serve for the thunder ? , Precious villain !
A most poor man made tame to fortune's blows , Who by the art of known and feeling sorrows Am pregnant to good pity .
These things sting His mind so venomously that burning shame Detains him from Cordelia .
What of that ?
Whither away ?
Poor venomous fool Be angry and dispatch .
I may not , madam .
I will tomorrow , And betimes I will , to the weird sisters .
Come .
If it be you that stir these daughters ' hearts Against their father , fool me not so much To bear it tamely .
Tubal , a wealthy Hebrew of my tribe , Will furnish me .
Mercy , mercy !
No jutty , frieze , Buttress , nor coign of vantage , but this bird Hath made his pendant bed and procreant cradle .
God save you , sir !
Here is the place , my lord .
Hath an argosy cast away coming from Tripolis .
Here comes the Prince and Claudio .
There's part of a power already footed .
My lord , I did , But answer made it none .
Mark me .
Show me , show me .
Ask me not what I know .
Where is the horse that doth untread again His tedious measures with the unbated fire That he did pace them first ?
He was a goodly king .
We have sworn , my lord , already .
I believe we must leave the killing out , when all is done .
One word more , honest neighbors .
Good Signior Angelo , you must excuse us all ; My wife is shrewish when I keep not hours .
If ever he go alone again , I'll never wrestle for prize more .
Not now to hear thee sing .
Hear me , good madam .
They will surely do us no harm .
When shall he come ?
Iago .
I saw 't not , thought it not , it harmed not me .
Dost thou say so ?
O you mighty gods , This world I do renounce , and in your sights Shake patiently my great affliction off .
Long live the king !
I am glad that my weak words Have struck but thus much show of fire from Brutus .
As the cony that you see dwell where she is kindled .
Not in deed , madam , for I can do nothing But what indeed is honest to be done .
Hortensio , have you told him all her faults ?
I do beseech your Grace to pardon me , and withal Forbear your conference with the noble duke .
Canst thou bring me to th ' party ?
Fury , Fury ! , There , Tyrant , there .
Lives , sir .
Great God of heaven , say amen to all !
Now he importunes him To tell it o'er .
May I know ?
Yield , cur .
Iago keeps his word .
Look I so pale , Lord Dorset , as the rest ?
Why dost thou use me thus ?
Let him not pass , But kill him rather .
With all my heart .
Come to me , that of this I may speak more .
I'll put it on .
Thou art The armorer of my heart .
Thou shalt Go back , I warrant thee !
No , madam , no .
Now , music , sound , and sing your solemn hymn .
Is your name Goneril ?
Yea , marry , dost thou hear , Balthasar ?
The deep of night is crept upon our talk , And nature must obey necessity , Which we will niggard with a little rest .
Hath she made her affection known to Benedick ?
Beware the ides of March .
A traveler .
Therefore the Dukes of Berri and of Brittany , Of Brabant and of Orleans , shall make forth , And you , Prince Dauphin , with all swift dispatch , To line and new-repair our towns of war With men of courage and with means defendant .
Your children shall be kings .
Stay , dog , for thou shalt hear me .
To be honest , as this world goes , is to be one man picked out of ten thousand .
Why Doth it not then our eyelids sink ?
I think thou art an ass .
Was 't you he rescued ?
No , It is thyself , mine own self's better part , Mine eye's clear eye , my dear heart's dearer heart , My food , my fortune , and my sweet hope's aim , My sole earth's heaven , and my heaven's claim .
I pray thee , overname them .
Now let it work .
So Guildenstern and Rosencrantz go to 't .
Yea , my lord .
Cure her of that .
Good or bad news , that thou com'st in so bluntly ?
Very gladly .
And for I know she taketh most delight In music , instruments , and poetry , Schoolmasters will I keep within my house , Fit to instruct her youth .
Ay , my lord .
And indeed it takes From our achievements , though performed at height , The pith and marrow of our attribute .
What's the matter ?
I prithee , pretty York , who told thee this ?
The greater cantle of the world is lost With very ignorance .
The noble duke my master , My worthy arch and patron , comes tonight .
Lord , how art thou changed !
I met the duke yesterday and had much question with him .
Look what is done can not be now amended .
Hark , now I hear them .
I shall laugh myself to death at this puppy-headed monster .
Dear , they durst not , So dear the love my people bore me , nor set A mark so bloody on the business , but With colors fairer painted their foul ends .
A damned death !
Com'st thou again for ransom ?
O brave new world , That has such people in 't !
I love your majesty According to my bond , no more nor less .
And you by land .
Over hill , over dale , Thorough bush , thorough brier , Over park , over pale , Thorough flood , thorough fire .
I prithee , who doth he trot withal ?
The greater therefore should our courage be .
Farewell , my lords .
If he be perjured , see you now , his reputation is as arrant a villain and a Jack Sauce as ever his black shoe trod upon God's ground and His earth , in my conscience , la .
I told him what I thought , and told no more Than what he found himself was apt and true .
Am I not stayed for , Cinna ?
Signior Hortensio , 'twixt such friends as we Few words suffice .
Kind gentlemen , let's go see poor Cassio dressed. , Come , mistress , you must tell 's another tale .
Thou must know , 'Tis not my profit that does lead mine honor ; Mine honor , it .
The mercy that was quick in us but late By your own counsel is suppressed and killed .
I have not heard the clock .
Stand back .
For the table , sir , it shall be served in .
But if you fail , without more speech , my lord , You must be gone from hence immediately .
If I find a hole in his coat , I will tell him my mind .
Tyrant , show thy face !
Why then , we are awake .
What work is here , Charmian ?
I would have her learn , my fair cousin , how perfectly I love her , and that is good English .
Tis a naughty night to swim in .
O heavens , that they were living both in Naples , The king and queen there !
God's will , I pray thee wish not one man more .
O mistress , villainy hath made mocks with love !
Oh , my fortunes have Corrupted honest men !
O Jupiter , how weary are my spirits !
Marry , your manhood , mew !
Call him hither , good Monsieur Le Beau .
Turn melancholy forth to funerals .
I think it was to see my mother's wedding .
I'll none of it .
What is he , Biondello ?
Are you answered ?
Thus says my king : an if your father's Highness Do not , in grant of all demands at large , Sweeten the bitter mock you sent his Majesty , He'll call you to so hot an answer of it That caves and womby vaultages of France Shall chide your trespass and return your mock In second accent of his ordinance .
What claim lays she to thee ?
I never looked for better at his hands After he once fell in with Mistress Shore .
What's your will ?
A most ridiculous monster , to make a wonder of a poor drunkard .
Tis Cinna .
Despise me If I do not .
When he stands where I am and sees you there .
I may sit in a corner and cry , "Heigh-ho for a husband ! " Lady Beatrice , I will get you one .
Bring the villain forth .
The revenges we are bound to take upon your traitorous father are not fit for your beholding .
I'll back to the duke of Gloucester and tell him so .
The fellow has good judgment .
Tis better as it is .
Now , Signior , what news ?
Satan , avoid !
Go , sirrah , take them to the buttery And give them friendly welcome every one .
Lady , you come hither to be married to this count ?
If we know him to be a thief , shall we not lay hands on him ?
Lives he , good uncle ?
We wait upon your Grace .
They never meet but there's a skirmish of wit between them .
I do love it better than laughing .
You'll heat my blood .
Your eyes do menace me .
Shut up your doors .
Thou villain , what sayest thou ?
Why , we have galls , and though we have some grace , Yet have we some revenge .
No .
In the corrupted currents of this world Offense's gilded hand may shove by justice , And oft 'tis seen the wicked prize itself Buys out the law .
Knock , knock !
I am not so well as I should be , but I'll ne'er out .
If what he might he is not , I would to heaven he were !
He wore his beaver up .
Good morrow , General .
I am sorry that I am deceived in him .
Dream on , dream on , of bloody deeds and death .
So let it be with Caesar .
Go comfort your cousin .
Look to 't , I charge you .
Sit down a while And let us once again assail your ears , That are so fortified against our story , What we have two nights seen .
Do not go forth today .
Let this be so .
Excellent good .
Tomorrow with your earliest Let me have speech with you. , Come , my dear love , The purchase made , the fruits are to ensue : That profit's yet to come 'tween me and you .
You come most carefully upon your hour .
This is Signor Antonio .
Have mind upon your health , tempt me no further .
I will none of your money .
He does well to commend it himself .
Speak , Pyramus. , Thisbe , stand forth .
My strange and self-abuse Is the initiate fear that wants hard use .
Be you constant in the accusation , and my cunning shall not shame me .
God-a-mercy , Grumio !
Had not that been as proper ?
Why , I am sure , if he forfeit thou wilt not take his flesh .
Let me report to him Your sweet dependency , and you shall find A conqueror that will pray in aid for kindness Where he for grace is kneeled to .
Do thou for him stand .
Let us deal justly .
Therefore prepare to die .
Nay , but the devil take mocking .
On the ground Sleep sound .
What soldiers , patch ?
But , were you wedded , you would bear some sway .
Are we all met ?
Ay , boy .
Will you go with me ?
You , mistress , all this coil is long of you .
Say not so , Agrippa .
What stay had we but Clarence ?
Oh , relation Too nice and yet too true !
Sir , he may live .
Why do you make such faces ?
Mine eyes do itch , Doth that bode weeping ?
Time travels in diverse paces with diverse persons .
That were the most if he should husband you .
I must discontinue your company .
No , Caesar shall not .
If she will stir hither , I shall seem to notify unto her .
But this eternal blazon must not be To ears of flesh and blood .
O mischief strangely thwarting !
All things that are , Are with more spirit chased than enjoyed .
Tell him , so please him come unto this place , He shall be satisfied and , by my honor , Depart untouched .
Naughty lady , These hairs which thou dost ravish from my chin Will quicken and accuse thee .
Now , what news on the Rialto ?
Then , my queen , in silence sad , Trip we after the night's shade .
Heaven preserve you !
I'll know thy thoughts .
Nay , then , good night our part .
That you shall surely find him , Lead to the Sagittary the raised search , And there will I be with him .
Oh , rare for Antony !
Alas , poor hurt fowl , now will he creep into sedges .
Ay , but these English are shrewdly out of beef .
And therefore will come .
There is some strange thing toward , Edmund .
Thus far can I praise him : he is of a noble strain , of approved valor , and confirmed honesty .
Do , if it will not stand .
Dost fall ?
There's money for your pains .
I go .
Was ever woman in this humor won ?
But beshrew my jealousy !
I gave you all , And in good time you gave it .
I do not like the office .
How now , what's the matter ?
Love looks not with the eyes but with the mind .
To the selfsame tune and words .
She , dying , as it must so be maintained , Upon the instant that she was accused , Shall be lamented , pitied and excused Of every hearer .
Didst thou not say he lied ?
How now ?
You may as well go about to turn the sun to ice with fanning in his face with a peacock's feather .
The day is yours .
But soft you , let me be .
Is Signior Lucentio within , sir ?
I am only sorry He had no other death's-man .
Yet I profess curing it by counsel .
For many miles about There's scarce a bush .
Good my sovereign , Take up the English short , and let them know Of what a monarchy you are the head .
Where is he ?
No , I will be the pattern of all patience .
Go with my brothers to my lords of England .
Why do you infect yourself with them ?
You do love my lord .
O noble Emperor , do not fight by sea !
For no kind of traffic Would I admit .
Mistress , how mean you that ?
I am not sorry neither .
Methinks I could not die anywhere so contented as in the king's company , his cause being just and his quarrel honorable .
For , by this light of heaven , I know not how I lost him .
With him ?
Now , as you are a Roman , tell me true .
Good husband , come home presently .
The dram of evil Doth all the noble substance of a doubt To his own scandal .
You have an excellent armor , but let my horse have his due .
Why , what is that to you ?
O thou foul thief , where hast thou stowed my daughter ?
Upon the talk of the poisoning ?
Here is his Majesty .
My lord , for aught I know .
Why , this ' a heavy chance 'twixt him and you , Your ancient , trusty , pleasant servant Grumio .
A grandam's name is little less in love Than is the doting title of a mother .
When you shall please to play the thieves for wives , I'll watch as long for you then .
Here comes Lorenzo .
The sight of lovers feedeth those in love .
You are unkind , Demetrius .
Will 't please you taste of what is here ?
Who is it that complains unto the king That I , forsooth , am stern and love them not ?
The arbitrament is like to be bloody .
Nay , an you be so tardy , come no more in my sight .
He is a craven and a villain else , an 't please your Majesty , in my conscience .
But lend it rather to thine enemy , Who , if he break , thou mayst with better face Exact the penalty .
Speak softly .
The venom clamors of a jealous woman Poisons more deadly than a mad dog's tooth .
Good now , hold thy tongue .
Will you hear the letter ?
We see yonder the beginning of the day , but I think we shall never see the end of it. , Who goes there ?
I protest , in the sincerity of love and honest kindness .
My Lord Bassanio , since you have found Antonio , We two will leave you .
Is not that he that lies upon the ground ?
Did my father strike my gentleman For chiding of his fool ?
Where be thy tenants and thy followers ?
I have been up this hour , awake all night .
If thou dost find him tractable to us , Encourage him and show him all our reasons .
I charge thee do so , as thou art my child .
You should for that have reprehended him .
What is this same ?
What promise , chuck ?
And now they do re-stem Their backward course , bearing with frank appearance Their purposes toward Cyprus .
All come to this ?
Why , the hot-blooded France that dowerless took Our youngest born , I could as well be brought To knee his throne , and , squirelike , pension beg To keep base life afoot .
Huntsman , I charge thee , tender well my hounds .
Nay then , I will not .
I set him there , sir , but his own disorders Deserved much less advancement .
Go , my dread lord , to your great-grandsire's tomb , From whom you claim .
Why , why is this ?
And 'tis great pity that the noble Moor Should hazard such a place as his own second With one of an ingraft infirmity .
My lord !
I will not disclose 'em .
Upon this hint I spake .
Beauty provoketh thieves sooner than gold .
I have a wife , whom I protest I love .
Wilt thou suffer them To make a rescue ?
And that were much he should , for he is given To sports , to wildness and much company .
I will hold friends with you , lady .
You shall have the mustard Or else you get no beef of Grumio .
That she brought me up , I likewise give her most humble thanks .
No , lad .
My noble girls !
E'en so , my lord .
Help me , help me !
My heart prays for him , though my tongue do curse .
How now , my pretty knave ?
I am sorry for her , as I have just cause , being her uncle and her guardian .
Cool it with a baboon's blood , Then the charm is firm and good .
Would you not have me honest ?
And now who knows But you , Lorenzo , whether I am yours ?
Call him in .
Very well , " "go to" !
How many months Do you desire ?
No Thisbe do I see .
Ay , Desdemona .
To cut the forfeiture from that bankrupt there .
God be wi ' you , princes all .
You have among you killed a sweet and innocent lady .
I did not see him since .
Where got'st thou that goose look ?
Good madam , stay a while .
I'll pheeze you , in faith .
Women's gentle brain Could not drop forth such giant-rude invention , Such Ethiop words , blacker in their effect Than in their countenance .
This purse of ducats I received from you , And Dromio my man did bring them me .
Remember me." I have sworn 't .
How lush and lusty the grass looks !
Pray God it be , sir .
Pray thee , sweet Mistress Margaret , deserve well at my hands by helping me to the speech of Beatrice .
Is it four o'clock ?
Tis he .
Tis certain then for Cyprus .
The trick of that voice I do well remember .
Caesar doth bear me hard , but he loves Brutus .
Adieu .
We therefore have great cause of thankfulness And shall forget the office of our hand Sooner than quittance of desert and merit According to the weight and worthiness .
Give you good morrow , sir .
What likelihood of his amendment , lords ?
I long To hear the story of your life , which must Take the ear strangely .
You would lift the moon out of her sphere if she would continue in it five weeks without changing .
I am but hurt .
I give them with this ring , Which when you part from , lose , or give away , Let it presage the ruin of your love
Come on , Nerissa , I have work in hand That you yet know not of .
The French ambassador upon that instant Craved audience .
Menas , I'll not on shore .
Is 't not Hortensio ?
Is Decius Brutus and Trebonius there ?
Pray you now , forget and forgive .
Fare you well .
I can not believe that in her .
Sir , my liege , Do not infest your mind with beating on The strangeness of this business .
If you saw yourself with your eyes or knew yourself with your judgment , the fear of your adventure would counsel you to a more equal enterprise .
Of princes in this number And nobles bearing banners , there lie dead One hundred twenty-six .
I am locked in one of them .
So much for him .
Oh , fie , fie , fie !
And is it thus ?
I am his brother , and I love him well .
Miranda. , O my father , I have broke your hest to say so !
Come , how wouldst thou praise me ?
If thou beest as poor for a subject as he's for a king , thou'rt poor enough .
Alack , my lord , that fault is none of yours .
To what base uses we may return , Horatio .
Ay , my good lord .
As I did stand my watch upon the hill , I looked toward Birnam , and anon methought The wood began to move .
Hence , and avoid my sight ! , So be my grave my peace as here I give Her father's heart from her. , Call France .
Neither rhyme nor reason can express how much .
A play there is , my lord , some ten words long , Which is as brief as I have known a play .
Spoke like an officer !
But yet I'll go in hate to feed upon The prodigal Christian. , Jessica , my girl , Look to my house .
Intend a kind of zeal both to the Prince and Claudio , as in love of your brother's honor , who hath made this match , and his friend's reputation , who is thus like to be cozened with the semblance of a maid , that you have discovered thus .
Warm , o ' my troth .
Enough .
They have their exits and their entrances , And one man in his time plays many parts , His acts being seven ages .
Tomorrow or next day they will be here .
Hence , make your best of it .
No , truly .
It lies in you .
To take 't again perforce , Monster ingratitude !
I deny it not .
Which dreams indeed are ambition , for the very substance of the ambitious is merely the shadow of a dream .
So to them both .
Truly , I would the gods had made thee poetical .
When you sued staying , Then was the time for words .
Why , as a woodcock to mine own springe , Osric .
But yet I'll make assurance double sure , And take a bond of fate .
Thou know'st not gold's effect .
But hush , no more .
O Lord , my lord , if they were but a week married , they would talk themselves mad .
A sibyl , that had numbered in the world The sun to course two hundred compasses , In her prophetic fury sewed the work .
What kind of god art thou , that suffer'st more Of mortal griefs than do thy worshippers ?
Are you not good ?
And is it physical To walk unbraced and suck up the humors Of the dank morning ?
Of what color ?
Villain , thou know'st not law of God nor man .
Nay , come , Kate , come .
Marry , th ' athversary was have possession of the pridge , but he is enforced to retire , and the duke of Exeter is master of the pridge .
No , pray thee , good Meg , I'll wear this .
Please 't your highness To grace us with your royal company ?
And how long is that , think you ?
Be collected .
Tarry a little .
Did he confess it ?
This my mean task Would be as heavy to me as odious , but The mistress which I serve quickens what's dead And makes my labors pleasures .
What should I say , sweet lady ?
What's the disease he means ?
Let our reciprocal vows be remembered .
The enemy increaseth every day .
Or if thou follow me , do not believe But I shall do thee mischief in the wood .
Something have you heard Of Hamlet's "transformation" , so call it Since nor th ' exterior nor the inward man Resembles that it was .
Good night , my lord .
Both sides are even .
Some dear cause Will in concealment wrap me up awhile .
What , art thou waking ?
Let her not walk i ' th ' sun .
Well moused , Lion !
Due for a chain your husband had of him .
The king , the king's to blame .
Do you withdraw yourself a little while ,
And so the lion vanished .
Is it upon record , or else reported Successively from age to age , he built it ?
Be factious for redress of all these griefs , And I will set this foot of mine as far As who goes farthest .
Well , I will hie , And so bestow these papers as you bade me .
We'll have thee to a couch Softer and sweeter than the lustful bed On purpose trimmed up for Semiramis .
If she find him not , To England send him or confine him where Your wisdom best shall think .
And I for Ganymede .
I would lose all , ay , sacrifice them all Here to this devil , to deliver you .
What answer , sir ?
Make it so known .
I pray the gods she may , with all my heart !
But my uncle-father and aunt-mother are deceived .
And she can weep , sir , weep .
We three are married , but you two are sped .
Farewell , my lord .
Tis two or three , my lord , that bring you word Macduff is fled to England .
Antonio and old Shylock , both stand forth .
That I have labored With all my wits , my pains , and strong endeavors , To bring your most imperial Majesties Unto this bar and royal interview , Your mightiness on both parts best can witness .
And yet for aught I see , they are as sick that surfeit with too much as they that starve with nothing .
I am doubtful that you have been conjunct And bosomed with her as far as we call hers .
Thou hast seen these signs .
If not , 'tis true this parting was well made .
These tidings will well comfort Cassius .
The hearts of old gave hands , But our new heraldry is hands , not hearts .
The Prince's fool !
Where is the gold I gave in charge to thee ?
Fairer than tongue can name thee , let me have Some patient leisure to excuse myself .
Another Hero !
As far , my lord , as will fill up the time 'Twixt this and supper .
I slept the next night well , fed well , was free and merry .
A trusty villain , sir , that very oft , When I am dull with care and melancholy , Lightens my humor with his merry jests .
Murder !
For even out of that will I cause these of Cyprus to mutiny , whose qualification shall come into no true taste again but by the displanting of Cassio .
He will not say so .
Nay , you must name his name , and half his face must be seen through the lion's neck .
Is this your speeding ?
For hear me , Hero , wooing , wedding , and repenting is as a Scotch jig , a measure , and a cinquepace .
And till she come , as truly as to heaven I do confess the vices of my blood So justly to your grave ears I'll present How I did thrive in this fair lady's love And she in mine .
Is the storm overblown ?
What's to be done ?
Pray , what do you think is his name ?
Pardon , sweet father .
You embrace your charge too willingly .
Therefore speak .
Well , then I shall see thee again ?
The dew is raw and cold .
I long to hear him call the drunkard "husband , " And how my men will stay themselves from laughter When they do homage to this simple peasant .
O Antony , O thou Arabian bird !
Marry , once before he won it of me with false dice .
I thought thou hadst been resolute .
Welcome , dear Rosencrantz and Guildenstern .
Never , O fault ! , revealed myself unto him Until some half-hour past , when I was armed .
Therefore confess thee freely of thy sin , For to deny each article with oath Can not remove nor choke the strong conception That I do groan withal .
What news ?
What news more ?
And hath given countenance to his speech , my lord , With almost all the holy vows of heaven .
It is a paltry cap , A custard-coffin , a bauble , a silken pie .
I must Once in a month recount what thou hast been , Which thou forget'st .
What , in our house ?
You see me , Lord Bassanio , where I stand Such as I am .
How malicious is my fortune , that I must repent to be just !
A sweeter and a Lovellier gentleman , Framed in the prodigality of nature , Young , valiant , wise , and , no doubt , right royal , The spacious world can not again afford .
Parted you in good terms ?
Spit , fire !
If your love do not persuade you to come , let not my letter." O love , dispatch all business and be gone !
They are .
Ingrateful fox , 'tis he .
More , I prithee , more .
Alas for both , both mine , Edward and Clarence !
And the queen too , and that presently .
Sure , it was the roar Of a whole herd of lions .
Are my deserts no better ?
I see you all are bent To set against me for your merriment .
Those that "Hobgoblin" call you , and "sweet Puck , " You do their work , and they shall have good luck .
Twas this flesh begot Those pelican daughters .
I shaked you , sir , and cried .
I will fetch him .
Why , in good time .
Then you do not love me ?
He raised the house with loud and coward cries .
Throw some of them at me .
Sweet friends , to bed .
He doth , for he did bid Antonius Send word to you he would be there tomorrow .
Something we will determine .
Tis a world to see , How tame , when men and women are alone , A meacock wretch can make the curstest shrew. , Give me thy hand , Kate .
I have fled myself , and have instructed cowards To run and show their shoulders .
What , says the married woman you may go ?
Some such squire he was That turned your wit the seamy side without And made you to suspect me with the Moor .
Nay , not sound , I pray you .
Come then and take the last warmth of my lips .
For there was never yet fair woman but she made mouths in a glass .
And so far am I glad it so did sort , As this their jangling I esteem a sport .
I do but beg a little changeling boy , To be my henchman .
You thought because he could not speak English in the native garb , he could not therefore handle an English cudgel .
Say it , Othello .
It is the devil .
Up , up , and see The great doom's image !
Tis not yet near day .
Come , Antonio .
Then patiently hear my impatience .
Farewell , everyone .
None but a holy hermit and her maid .
Draw up your powers .
What you know , you know .
Therefore with frank and with uncurbed plainness Tell us the Dauphin's mind .
Give welcome to my friend .
And in the morn and liquid dew of youth , Contagious blastments are most imminent .
Brutus and Caesar , what should be in that "Caesar" ?
But since the affairs of men rest still incertain , Let's reason with the worst that may befall .
So farewell to you both .
You shall have letters from me to my son In your behalf , to meet you on the way .
Peace , doting wizard , peace .
I could be well moved if I were as you .
I knew your father .
A whole one , I .
Peace !
Petruchio is my name , Antonio's son , A man well known throughout all Italy .
Hold you the watch tonight ?
For when mine hours Were nice and lucky , men did ransom lives Of me for jests ; but now I'll set my teeth And send to darkness all that stop me .
Stay , Jaques , stay .
Nothing , madam .
Good name in man and woman , dear my lord , Is the immediate jewel of their souls .
He is a very proper man .
Oh , out of that "no hope" What great hope have you !
By foul play , as thou sayst , were we heaved thence , But blessedly holp hither .
Hush !
Marry , sir , they have committed false report ; moreover , they have spoken untruths ; secondarily , they are slanders ; sixth and lastly , they have belied a lady ; thirdly , they have verified unjust things ; and , to conclude , they are lying knaves .
Thou didst drink The stale of horses and the gilded puddle Which beasts would cough at .
Why , there's no remedy .
Call the clotpoll back .
I have no hope That he's undrowned .
Well , And well am like to do , for I perceive , Four feasts are toward .
What bloody man is that ?
Who is it that can tell me who I am ?
Go , take it up unto thy master's use .
But , soft !
I dare , and do defy thee for a villain .
Tonight in Harfleur will we be your guest ; Tomorrow for the march are we addressed .
Whip him , fellows , Till like a boy , you see him cringe his face And whine aloud for mercy .
The greatest note of it is his melancholy .
Oh , that a lady of one man refused Should of another therefore be abused !
And ever will , though he do shake me off To beggarly divorcement , love him dearly , Comfort forswear me !
Poor and content is rich , and rich enough , But riches fineless is as poor as winter To him that ever fears he shall be poor .
Cassio knows you not .
Oh , are you come , Iago ?
My necessaries are embarked .
There's no clock in the forest .
I choose her for myself .
Not he that himself is not so , which is Mark Antony .
But I pray you commend my counterfeiting to him .
Tis the curse of service .
I have great comfort from this fellow .
When it is paid according to the tenor .
I noted her not , but I looked on her .
The glove which I have given him for a favor May haply purchase him a box o ' th ' ear .
Fie , what a slug is Hastings that he comes not To tell us whether they will come or no !
Nay , I hope .
Never , my lord .
I would I were at home .
Since Cassius first did whet me against Caesar , I have not slept .
The fold stands empty in the drowned field , And crows are fatted with the murrain flock .
With naught but truth .
I will send for him , and question him yourself .
Saving your merry humor , here's the note How much your chain weighs to the utmost carat , The fineness of the gold , and chargeful fashion , Which doth amount to three-odd ducats more Than I stand debted to this gentleman .
Why do you speak , too , "Why blame you me to love you ? " ?
Wilt thou know Th ' effect of what I wrote ?
By th ' clock 'tis day , And yet dark night strangles the travelling lamp .
The French is gone off , look you , and there is gallant and most prave passages .
What's he that speaks for Edmund , Earl of Gloucester ?
If they do this , As , if God please , they shall , my ransom then Will soon be levied .
But though thou art adjudged to the death , And passed sentence may not be recalled But to our honour's great disparagement , Yet will I favor thee in what I can .
I must be cruel only to be kind .
Though our lives , Your spirits shine through you .
I will , my lord .
His leg is but so-so , and yet 'tis well .
Good Norfolk , hie thee to thy charge .
thee aloud "England is thine , Ireland is thine , France is thine , and Harry Plantagenet is thine , " who , though I speak it before his face , if he be not fellow with the best king , thou shalt find the best king of good fellows .
Where the place ?
What though I killed her husband and her father ?
Tomorrow , if you please to speak with me , I will come home to you .
Wake her not .
Where is gentle Rivers , Vaughan , Grey ?
Oh , now , who will behold The royal captain of this ruined band
How now , Roderigo !
Thus it remains , and the remainder thus .
I'll fish for thee and get thee wood enough .
Alack , sir , I am sand-blind .
Ghastly looks Are at my service , like enforced smiles , And both are ready in their offices , At any time to grace my stratagems .
For , my good liege , she is so idly kinged , Her scepter so fantastically borne By a vain , giddy , shallow , humorous youth , That fear attends her not .
Spake you not these words plain : "Sirrah , knock me here , rap me here , knock me well , and knock me soundly" ?
There , gentle Hermia , may I marry thee .
Horrible sight !
My noble brother !
Iago beckons me .
Caesar .
He hath the falling sickness .
Ay , mistress , and Petruchio is the master , That teacheth tricks eleven and twenty long To tame a shrew and charm her chattering tongue .
Even as a flatt'ring dream or worthless fancy .
O Regan , Goneril , Your old kind father , whose frank heart gave all , Oh , that way madness lies .
I'll to my charge .
Your Highness bade me ask for it today .
Speak thou now .
May I never To this good purpose , that so fairly shows , Dream of impediment !
Well , let's away and say how much is done .
Sir , good success .
Is 't possible , my lord ?
The wager thou hast won , and I will add Unto their losses twenty thousand crowns , Another dowry to another daughter , For she is changed as she had never been .
Why , for that too .
Yet you are withered .
Thence we looked toward England And cited up a thousand fearful times , During the wars of York and Lancaster That had befall'n us .
We must not .
Shame , and eternal shame , nothing but shame !
Were you well served , you would be taught your duty .
Away !
We'll no more meet , no more see one another .
We'll wait upon your lordship .
Know me for Brutus !
Refuse not , mighty lord , this proffered love .
Good nuncle , in , and ask thy daughters blessing .
Then must we look from his age to receive not alone the imperfections of long-engrafted condition , but therewithal the unruly waywardness that infirm and choleric years bring with them .
Now I must To the young man send humble treaties , dodge And palter in the shifts of lowness , who With half the bulk o' th' world played as I pleased , Making and marring fortunes .
When these prodigies Do so conjointly meet , let not men say , "These are their reasons .
Who can blot that name With any just reproach ?
Bid him levy straight The greatest strength and power that he can make And meet me suddenly at Salisbury .
All this done Upon the gad ? , Edmund , how now ?
A second Daniel ! , A Daniel , Jew !
So should he look That seems to speak things strange .
Macbeth !
Is not that he ?
Who's there , in th ' other devil's name ?
The French have reinforced their scattered men .
What is she ?
That's the end .
Do you know him ?
Are you my wife and will not call me "husband" ?
What , a feast , a feast ?
Break an hour's promise in love ?
His taints and honors Waged equal with him .
Tis meet I should be used so , very meet .
With Cassio , mistress .
The poop was beaten gold , Purple the sails , and so perfumed that The winds were lovesick with them .
Let me see .
Within this half hour will he be asleep .
But these offers , Which serve not for his vantage , he shakes off , And so should you .
If she will return me my jewels I will give over my suit and repent my unlawful solicitation .
May it be done ?
I am glad thou canst speak no better English , for if thou couldst , thou wouldst find me such a plain king that thou wouldst think I had sold my farm to buy my crown .
I , sir , am Dromio .
No words .
But where's the money ?
Well .
Canst thou so daff me ?
The English power is near , led on by Malcolm , His uncle Siward and the good Macduff .
No more a soldier .
Of us must Pompey presently be sought , Or else he seeks out us .
Thou dost see I eat .
Censure me in your wisdom , and awake your senses that you may the better judge .
They are friends , Ratcliffe and Lovell .
Speak , Count , 'tis your cue .
As much unto my good Lord Chamberlain .
I will indeed no longer endure it , nor am I yet persuaded to put up in peace what already I have foolishly suffered .
I know he loves me well .
He , woman .
Sirrah , your father's dead .
He would make but a sport of it and torment the poor lady worse .
Come , bustle , bustle .
O gentle lady , 'T is not for you to hear what I can speak : The repetition , in a woman's ear , Would murder as it fell .
Dost thou lie so low ?
Cursed be thy stones for thus deceiving me !
Your reasons are too shallow and too quick .
Trip , Audrey , trip , Audrey. , I attend , I attend .
Your lordship speaks most infallibly of him .
You shall have some part of your will .
I will do 't , my lord .
Welcome , my lord .
Oh , this is it that makes your servants droop !
Upon that I kiss your hand , and I call you my queen .
We will spare for no wit , I warrant you .
For , of my heart , those charms , thine eyes , are blotted .
Have you a mind to sink ?
She shall not harm thee , Helena .
For a fish without a fin , there's a fowl without a feather. , Go , get thee gone .
Is it the fashion that discarded fathers Should have thus little mercy on their flesh ?
Here comes Oberon .
Tis done .
Here is more of us .
Then put up your pipes in your bag , for I'll away .
I must go with you to Belmont .
If thou didst it , thou art the nonpareil .
No king of England if not king of France .
What hast thou been ?
Here's that , I warrant you , will pay them all .
What , is this so ?
But I shall see The winged vengeance overtake such children .
The Lady Beatrice hath a quarrel to you .
O , that's the sword to it .
I am your own for ever .
I speak but brotherly of him , but should I anatomize him to thee as he is , I must blush and weep , and thou must look pale and wonder .
Monster , lay to your fingers .
My father loved Sir Rowland as his soul , And all the world was of my father's mind .
Give me some help .
They say this town is full of cozenage , As nimble jugglers that deceive the eye , Dark-working sorcerers that change the mind , Soul-killing witches that deform the body , Disguised cheaters , prating mountebanks , And many suchlike liberties of sin .
The duke of Exeter has very gallantly maintained the pridge .
Give mine the benefit of seigniory , And let my griefs frown on the upper hand .
He is simply the most active gentleman of France .
How goes the night , boy ?
Howl , howl , howl , howl !
Ha , art thou bedlam ?
Serve you , sir .
Better cheer may you have , but not with better heart .
It eats and sleeps and hath such senses As we have , such .
Bring me word how tall she is .
Do you see , gentlemen ?
My dagger , little cousin ?
If you shall send them word you will not come , Their minds may change .
It were too gross To rib her cerecloth in the obscure grave .
I gave him the stuff .
No , Cassius , no .
What you would work me to , I have some aim .
Murder !
Madam , I'll take my leave .
What is amiss ?
Nay , let me praise you while I have a stomach .
For my Lord Lackbeard there , he and I shall meet , and till then peace be with him .
Is Claudio thine enemy ?
He that keeps nor crust nor crumb , Weary of all , shall want some .
If the ill spirit have so fair a house , Good things will strive to dwell with 't .
Press near and second him .
And so of men .
What is the matter ?
I have ever held my cap off to thy fortunes .
The weary way hath made you melancholy .
Let me see his eyes , That , when I note another man like him , I may avoid him .
Nor anyone .
He needs as many , sir , as Caesar has , Or needs not us .
Prithee , peace .
Or , if you will , Come home to me , and I will wait for you .
Wilt thou have music ?
Sleep shall neither night nor day Hang upon his penthouse lid .
He is as disproportioned in his manners As in his shape. , Take with you your companions .
I never saw a better-fashioned gown , More quaint , more pleasing , nor more commendable .
Better it were they all came by his father , Or by the father there were none at all , For emulation who shall now be nearest Will touch us all too near if God prevent not .
Sir , grieve not you .
I never got him. , Hark , the duke's trumpets .
Farewell , kind Charmian .
By my troth , he'll yield the crow a pudding one of these days .
And there the snake throws her enameled skin , Weed wide enough to wrap a fairy in .
Tis very good .
Leave holloaing , man .
In which regard ,
Oh , what a world is this when what is comely Envenoms him that bears it !
None in the world , nor do I know the man .
You have it full , Benedick .
All things in common nature should produce Without sweat or endeavor .
I am scarce in breath , my lord .
The ship was under sail .
Pardon , dear father .
O noble Caesar !
A man may see how this world goes with no eyes .
But fare ye well .
Richard !
Make you a wholesome answer .
I pray you , master , tell me ?
Your Grace attended to their sugared words But looked not on the poison of their hearts .
Come , shall we about it ?
Give me thy hand .
Give me my armor .
Who offered him the crown ?
Do you smell a fault ?
Wilt thou have me ?
Here comes two of the banished duke's pages .
Nor what I have done by water .
Ay , Casca .
Be by , good madam , when we do awake him .
I have as much of this in art as you , But yet my nature could not bear it so .
It well appears .
There remain And fortify it strongly 'gainst the French .
Carry me to the jail ?
Good morrow , friends .
In truth , I know it is a sin to be a mocker , but he ! , why , he hath a horse better than the Neapolitan's , a better bad habit of frowning than the Count Palatine .
You are a fool .
Now to that name my courage prove my title !
Furthermore , I pray you show my youth old Shylock's house .
What a brazen-faced varlet art thou to deny thou knowest me !
Thou strik'st not me , 'tis Caesar thou defeat'st .
Wilt thou at Ninny's tomb meet me straightway ?
We did , my lord , weeping and commenting Upon the sobbing deer .
Sure it is hers .
Never , my lord .
For me , that I may surely keep mine oath , I will be married to a wealthy widow , Ere three days pass , which hath as long loved me As I have loved this proud disdainful haggard .
My love thou art , my love , I think .
Why , that the Moor first gave to Desdemona , That which so often you did bid me steal .
Good morrow , neighbor Baptista .
Speak , I'll go no further .
Swell , bosom , with thy fraught , For 'tis of aspics ' tongues !
Neither can be enjoyed If both remain alive .
That's a question .
Thou art as wise as thou art beautiful .
Therefore let's follow .
Should I have answered Caius Cassius so ?
Of thirty sail .
And my heart too .
Promise me life , and I'll confess the truth .
What says the silver with her virgin hue ?
How do you , madam ?
Hear Antony .
There are no tongues else for 's turn .
Or who pronounced The bitter sentence of poor Clarence ' death Before I be convict by course of law ?
A ring he hath of mine worth forty ducats , And for the same he promised me a chain .
If you like upon report The soil , the profit , and this kind of life , I will your very faithful feeder be And buy it with your gold right suddenly .
But had he such a chain of thee or no ?
I think so , Charmian .
Hark !
Why did he so ?
The Jew shall have all justice .
A carrion death , within whose empty eye There is a written scroll .
Tis as arrant a piece of knavery , mark you now , as can be offert , in your conscience now , is it not ?
So , so , so , so !
Speak , speak !
He is a sick man that would speak with you .
Why , what's the matter ?
Ely with Richmond troubles me more near Than Buckingham and his rash-levied strength .
Death and damnation !
I'll see thee hanged on Sunday first .
Nay , send in time !
Go you to him from me .
Where is that viper ?
Why , there then !
Well , honor is the subject of my story .
And she's obedient , as you say , obedient , Very obedient. , Proceed you in your tears. , Concerning this , sir , Oh , well-painted passion ! , I am commanded home. , Get you away , I'll send for you anon. , Sir , I obey the mandate And will return to Venice. , Hence , avaunt !
You may as well do anything most hard , As seek to soften that , than which what's harder ? , His Jewish heart .
Nearest his heart" , those are the very words .
Decius , well urged .
I'll attend her here And woo her with some spirit when she comes .
Name him .
Why , shall we turn to men ?
What was it you told me of today , that your niece Beatrice was in love with Signor Benedick ?
Those that are married already , all but one , shall live .
Swear by your double self , And there's an oath of credit !
You have trained me like a peasant , obscuring and hiding from me all gentlemanlike qualities .
Art of this house ?
I robbed his wound of it .
Where , where ?
Biondello , what of that ?
Wrong hath but wrong , and blame the due of blame .
Where art thou , proud Demetrius ?
Come on , i ' God's name , once more toward our father's .
And my trust , Like a good parent , did beget of him A falsehood in its contrary as great As my trust was , which had indeed no limit , A confidence sans bound .
This if she perform , She shall not sue unheard .
If you deny it , let the danger light Upon your charter and your city's freedom .
Ay , my commander .
Yes , a dozen , and as many to th ' vantage as would store the world they played for .
I am transformed , master , am I not ?
That thou shalt see the difference of our spirit , I pardon thee thy life before thou ask it .
Let it be so .
O true , good Catesby .
It seems he hath great care to please his wife .
Let us quit all And give our vineyards to a barbarous people .
Thy truth then be thy dower .
How say you , Cassio ?
If ever I live to see it , I will challenge it .
Even so .
What do you see ?
Peradventure , to make it the more gracious , I shall sing it at her death .
If you choose that wherein I am contained , Straight shall our nuptial rites be solemnized .
I think he will stand very strong with us .
I pray thee , good Horatio , wait upon him .
What are his words ?
Call forth Nathaniel , Joseph , Nicholas , Philip , Walter , Sugarsop , and the rest .
And in part him , but , " you may say , "not well .
Edward's unhappy sons do bid thee flourish .
And indeed , my lord , The wretched animal heaved forth such groans That their discharge did stretch his leathern coat Almost to bursting , and the big round tears Coursed one another down his innocent nose In piteous chase .
I knew a wench married in an afternoon as she went to the garden for parsley to stuff a rabbit , and so may you , sir .
You will have Gremio to keep you fair .
Draw , you rogue , or I'll so carbonado your shanks .
Therefore then , thou gaudy gold , Hard food for Midas , I will none of thee .
Bad is the world , and all will come to naught When such ill dealing must be seen in thought .
Casca , by your voice .
Grieved I I had but one ?
That now I will have , that's the humor of it .
Ready .
But 'tis strange .
Methoughts I saw a thousand fearful wracks , A thousand men that fishes gnawed upon , Wedges of gold , great anchors , heaps of pearl , Inestimable stones , unvalued jewels , All scattered in the bottom of the sea .
Ay me , it is my husband .
So do not I .
Master young man , you , I pray you , which is the way to Master Jew's ?
We'll feast each other ere we part , and let's Draw lots who shall begin .
The star is fall'n .
Seek it out .
Their malady convinces The great assay of art , but at his touch , Such sanctity hath heaven given his hand , They presently amend .
And you shall be satisfied .
No , my lord .
I saw the handkerchief .
Master , master , look about you .
I wrote to you When rioting in Alexandria .
O braggart vile and damned furious wight , The grave doth gape , and doting death is near .
Go put on thy defenses .
He shall in time be ready .
If any man doubt that , let him put me to my purgation .
If you did wear a beard upon your chin , I'd shake it on this quarrel .
Marry , before your ladyship , I grant , She puts her tongue a little in her heart And chides with thinking .
She can not love Nor take no shape nor project of affection She is so self-endeared .
Who comes here ?
What is thy news then ?
Prithee , listen well .
Yonder they lie , the poor old man their father making such pitiful dole over them that all the beholders take his part with weeping .
Take heed of Cassius .
We have scorched the snake , not killed it .
For both our sakes , I would that word were true .
Let me have your hand .
The broken rancor of your high-swoll'n hates , But lately splintered , knit , and joined together , Must gently be preserved , cherished , and kept .
Marry , here's grace and a codpiece , that's a wise man and a fool .
God restore you to health !
Run to the Capitol , and nothing else ?
A monster , a very monster in apparel , and not like a Christian footboy or a gentleman's lackey .
Claribel .
What does he say of Brutus ?
Look how thy servants do attend on thee , Each in his office ready at thy beck .
Who hath relieved you ?
A truant disposition , good my lord .
Knock , I say .
It seems not meet , nor wholesome to my place , To be producted ( as , if I stay , I shall ) Against the Moor .
And from henceforth When you are over-earnest with your Brutus , He'll think your mother chides and leave you so .
Most heartily I do beseech the court To give the judgment .
Adieu !
I hope he is , but yet let mothers doubt .
I'll do 't , but it dislikes me .
Who chooseth me must give and hazard all he hath." Must give , for what ?
Have at you now !
What wouldst thou do , old man ?
Hail , Caesar , and my lord !
I know the boy will well usurp the grace , Voice , gait , and action of a gentlewoman .
Then 'tis he : the rest That are within the note of expectation Already are i ' th ' court .
The pale companion is not for our pomp .
By this hand , I love thee .
I think thou art in mind , and so am I. Nay , master , both in mind and in my shape .
Support him by the arm .
A worthy pioneer !
Epicurism and lust Make it more like a tavern or a brothel Than a graced palace .
I thank you , sir .
The duke and senators of Venice greet you .
Sir John Falstaff .
Ay , good my lord .
What should I say to you ?
Decius Brutus loves thee not .
Your case is better .
I did not , gentle husband , lock thee forth .
Do you go back dismayed ?
Nor know I aught But that he's well and will be shortly here .
I know it is the moon .
The folly of this island .
Now know you , Casca , I have moved already Some certain of the noblest-minded Romans To undergo with me an enterprise Of honorable-dangerous consequence .
She In th' habiliments of the goddess Isis That day appeared , and oft before gave audience , As 'tis reported , so .
Madam , in Rome .
Welcome , my lord .
Your father got excellent husbands , if a maid could come by them .
Wilt thou rest damned ?
How is it else the "man i ' th ' moon" ?
Tomorrow is the joyful day , Audrey .
Delay not , Caesar .
It waves me still .
I am constant to my purpose .
And you , sir .
As ever you come of women , come in quickly to Sir John .
I will deserve your pains .
O villain , villain , smiling , damned villain !
You nimble lightnings , dart your blinding flames Into her scornful eyes !
But get thee back .
Will you two help to hasten them ?
O perjured woman , thou dost stone my heart , And mak'st me call what I intend to do A murder , which I thought a sacrifice !
None of these rogues and cowards But Ajax is their fool .
They are loves I bear to you .
What , up and down , carved like an apple tart ?
Nay , and most like .
The news is true , my lord .
Then make a ring about the corpse of Caesar , And let me show you him that made the will .
It may be his enemy is a gentleman of great sort , quite from the answer of his degree .
So thou , that hast no unkind mate to grieve thee , With urging helpless patience would relieve me ; But , if thou live to see like right bereft , This fool-begged patience in thee will be left .
And how besides thyself ?
But all the charms of love , Salt Cleopatra , soften thy wanned lip !
Look , Don Pedro is returned to seek you .
Amen .
Didst thou not hear somebody ?
More knocking .
What noise ?
O bitter consequence That Edward still should live "true noble prince" !
Come , sit on me .
Light , I say , light !
Bid Gloucester think of this , and he will weep .
Fare you well .
And an ill singer , my lord .
To be a well-favored man is the gift of fortune , but to write and read comes by nature .
Rather your eyes must with his judgment look .
Canst thou hold up thy heavy eyes awhile , And touch thy instrument a strain or two ?
She haunts me in every place .
So do I , my lord .
Then hear me , gracious sovereign , and you peers That owe yourselves , your lives , and services To this imperial throne .
That is another simple sin in you , to bring the ewes and the rams together and to offer to get your living by the copulation of cattle ; to be bawd to a bellwether and to betray a she-lamb of a twelvemonth to a crooked-pated old cuckoldly ram , out of all reasonable match .
I will incontinently drown myself .
I hear their drum .
Tis bitter cold , And I am sick at heart .
Y ' have ungently , Brutus , Stole from my bed .
Your vessels and your spells provide , Your charms and everything beside .
How dost thou , Guildenstern ?
Tom , away !
Are you a married man or a bachelor ?
What was th ' impediment that broke this off ?
That you did fear is done .
Nay , weep not , gentle Eros .
Ink and paper , Charmian .
Yes , Captain , but with this acknowledgement : That God fought for us .
If I had thee in Lipsbury pinfold , I would make thee care for me .
Best of comfort , And ever welcome to us .
What is thy will with her ?
The other half Comes to the privy coffer of the state , And the offender's life lies in the mercy Of the Duke only 'gainst all other voice .
Oh , a good wish upon you .
I have years on my back forty- eight .
I know he would not be a wolf But that he sees the Romans are but sheep .
My dear master , My captain , and my emperor , let me say , Before I strike this bloody stroke , farewell .
Your constancy Hath left you unattended .
I will have my revenge ere I depart his house .
Tut , she's a lamb , a dove , a fool to him !
It is my wretched fortune .
I can be patient .
My Lord Constable , the armor that I saw in your tent tonight , are those stars or suns upon it ?
That thing you speak of , I took it for a man .
Why , this is not Lear .
What else ?
Infer fair England's peace by this alliance .
I say my daughter is my flesh and blood .
Beshrew me , if I would do such a wrong For the whole world .
We'll leave you , Brutus .
What I should think of this I can not tell , But this I think : there's no man is so vain That would refuse so fair an offered chain .
O , cry your mercy , sir. , Tom's a-cold .
We shall find a time , Audrey .
Yet they are not joined .
A kind good night to all !
This is his sword .
O Lord , I must laugh .
But Oh , how bitter a thing it is to look into happiness through another man's eyes .
Sit i ' th ' middle .
Oh , a thousand thousand times , and then of so gentle a condition !
O thou weed , Who art so lovely fair and smell'st so sweet That the sense aches at thee , would thou hadst ne'er been born !
All is confirmed , my lord , which was reported .
Tis hard ; almost impossible .
By your patience , I may not suffer you to visit them .
Hail to your lordship .
It is to be all made of faith and service , And so am I for Phoebe .
Master Constable , you go not the way to examine .
Do not say so , Lysander .
What grows of it , no matter .
Thy woes will make them sharp and pierce like mine .
Swear by her foot , that she may tread out the oath .
Why are you virtuous ?
What's the matter ?
And then , sir , does he this , he does , What was I about to say ?
What , art thou come ? , On , gentlemen , away !
The concernancy , sir ?
Leave me , I say .
A king , perhaps , My lord , How chance the prophet could not at that time Have told me , I being by , that I should kill him ?
Is thy master coming ?
I pray you , give me leave to go from hence .
I pray thee , cease thy counsel , Which falls into mine ears as profitless As water in a sieve .
I came from Corinth , my most gracious lord .
Will you think so ?
My life , sir !
My fairy lord , this must be done with haste .
I do believe that these applauses are For some new honors that are heaped on Caesar .
Content with Hermia ?
O my lord , my lord , Forgive my fearful sails !
Sir , I am vexed .
Sometimes from her eyes I did receive fair speechless messages .
Men must not walk too late .
Two deep enemies , Foes to my rest , and my sweet sleep's disturbers , Are they that I would have thee deal upon .
Well , forward , forward !
Oh , that brave Caesar !
Come hither , sirrah .
Alas , good Cassio !
But there's a saying very old and true : "If that you will France win , Then with Scotland first begin." For once the eagle England being in prey , To her unguarded nest the weasel Scot Comes sneaking and so sucks her princely eggs , Playing the mouse in absence of the cat , To 'tame and havoc more than she can eat .
Twill be a storm .
Stay !
Let me not stay a jot for dinner .
Good cheer , Antonio !
If it will please Caesar To be so good to Caesar as to hear me , I shall beseech him to befriend himself .
And this , Metellus Cimber .
She hath good leave .
But here comes Antony .
Say "a day" without the "ever." No , no , Orlando , men are April when they woo , December when they wed. Maids are May when they are maids , but the sky changes when they are wives .
Bless thy five wits .
I am sure the duke Will never grant this forfeiture to hold .
Sleep a little .
What wound did ever heal but by degrees ?
I see a voice .
You whoreson malt-horse drudge !
The little dogs and all , Tray , Blanch , and Sweetheart , see , they bark at me .
What's the matter ?
Why , one that swears and lies .
Methinks your maw , like mine , should be your clock , And strike you home without a messenger .
Peter , didst ever see the like ?
But , by 'r Lady , he must build churches then , or else shall he suffer not thinking on , with the hobby-horse , whose epitaph is "For , oh , for , oh , the hobby-horse is forgot." What means this , my lord ?
Fortune is merry , And in this mood will give us anything .
Be not so .
I am Grumio's pledge .
Nay , but I know who loves him .
Yes , something you can deny for your own safety : you have been a great thief by sea .
That she's the chosen of Signior Hortensio .
Ay , and that thou and the proudest of you all shall find when he comes home .
Call the messenger .
I arrest thee of high treason , by the name of Henry , Lord Scroop of Masham .
I shall serve you , sir , Truly , however else .
So , of his gentleness , Knowing I loved my books , he furnished me From mine own library with volumes that I prize above my dukedom .
Only to despite them , I will endeavor anything .
They follow the king's pleasure .
To die , to sleep .
So he served the second , and so the third .
What's here ?
And what of him , Tranio ?
If our father would sleep till I waked him , you should enjoy half his revenue forever , and live the beloved of your brother , Edgar." Hum , conspiracy ?
As I !
Doth it ?
How can these things in me seem scorn to you , Bearing the badge of faith to prove them true ?
How now , sirrah !
If you have any pity , grace , or manners , You would not make me such an argument .
Be this the whetstone of your sword .
Are there balance here to weigh The flesh ?
They can not budge till your release .
So be gone .
Is in his retirement marvelous distempered .
Thou dost thy office fairly .
Oft have I heard of sanctuary men , But sanctuary children , ne'er till now .
Nay , you must forget that .
O vengeance !
The obscure bird Clamored the livelong night .
Come on .
Take but good note , and you shall see in him The triple pillar of the world transformed Into a strumpet's fool .
Here , madam .
Then is the world one .
But take a taste of my finding him , and relish it with good observance .
I had a wound here that was like a "T , " But now 'tis made an "H." They do retire .
And I know not what's spent in the search .
And I must be from thence !
How much I had to do to calm his rage !
And but my noble Moor Is true of mind and made of no such baseness As jealous creatures are , it were enough To put him to ill thinking .
And , sister , as the winds give benefit And convey is assistant , do not sleep , But let me hear from you .
If their purgation did consist in words , They are as innocent as grace itself .
But good lieutenant , is your general wived ?
God be with you all .
His very opinion in the letter !
It is not honesty in me to speak What I have seen and known .
I pray you , pardon me .
To be your fellow You may deny me , but I'll be your servant Whether you will or no .
Please , let me stay .
I can as well be hanged as tell the manner of it .
Antonio .
Prescribe not us our duty .
Say that she frown ; I'll say she looks as clear As morning roses newly washed with dew .
Where ?
I dreamt last night of the three weird sisters : To you they have showed some truth .
Provide your going ; Choose your own company and command what cost Your heart has mind to .
How now ?
Master , if you do , expect spoon meat ; or bespeak a long spoon .
With what , i ' th ' name of God ?
Your Grace does me as great honors as can be desired in the hearts of his subjects .
Good friends , go in and taste some wine with me .
Catesby , o'erlook the walls .
Was never widow had so dear a loss .
Be merciful , great duke , to men of mold .
Come , will you go with me ?
I will dispatch it straight .
Take it and do 't , and leave me for this time .
Say not so .
All eyes !
Peace , ho !
Caesar is turned to hear .
It did always seem so to us .
Peace .
Bid him bring his pen and inkhorn to the jail .
Mark , I say , instantly , and carry it so As I have set it down .
My comfort is that old age , that ill layer-up of beauty , can do no more spoil upon my face .
Thou hast .
I do not well know , my lord .
Those that have known the earth so full of faults .
Pronounce that sentence then on me , my liege .
If knife , drugs , serpents , have Edge , sting , or operation , I am safe .
Marry , for my part , I think the duke hath lost never a man , but one that is like to be executed for robbing a church , one Bardolph , if your Majesty know the man .
That's my sister .
There , drink that for me .
Lepidus flatters both , Of both is flattered , but he neither loves , Nor either cares for him .
Where are they ?
What dost thou mean ?
Sir boy , I'll whip you from your foining fence , Nay , as I am a gentleman , I will .
What , all my pretty chickens and their dam At one fell swoop ?
Well , get thee gone .
This must crave , An if this be at all , a most strange story .
Make it no wonder .
But how long shall that title "ever" last ?
He longs not for the dawning as we do .
Mere prattle without practice Is all his soldiership .
He faints ! , My lord , my lord !
You peers , continue this united league .
God and our innocence defend and guard us !
They have tied me to a stake .
I'll make him find him .
The next Caesarion smite , Till by degrees the memory of my womb , Together with my brave Egyptians all , By the discandying of this pelleted storm Lie graveless till the flies and gnats of Nile Have buried them for prey !
From me , whose love was of that dignity That it went hand in hand even with the vow I made to her in marriage , and to decline Upon a wretch whose natural gifts were poor To those of mine .
Sweet Bassanio , my ships have all miscarried .
Thou shouldst rather ask if it were possible any villainy should be so rich .
Know'st thou Gower ?
Nor send you out o ' th ' way ?
Yet , in reason , no man should possess him with any appearance of fear , lest he , by showing it , should dishearten his army .
For aught that I could ever read , Could ever hear by tale or history , The course of true love never did run smooth .
For he is , sure , i ' th ' island .
It is young Orlando , that tripped up the wrestler's heels and your heart both in an instant .
Why , the enemy is loud .
Tis thus : Who tells me true , though in his tale lie death , I hear him as he flattered .
He can report , As seemeth by his plight , of the revolt The newest state .
Thou art sure of me .
Whence is that knocking ?
O excellent device , and make a sop of him .
How many times shall Caesar bleed in sport , That now on Pompey's basis lies along No worthier than the dust !
O Charmian , I will never go from hence .
Lucius ! , Fast asleep ?
Marry , well remembered .
He had one yesterday .
I am tied to th ' stake , and I must stand the course .
Thy gown ?
On my knees I beg That you'll vouchsafe me raiment , bed , and food." Good sir , no more .
I thank you , valiant Cassio .
Therefore no more but to the matter .
Let floods o'erswell and fiends for food howl on !
Well met , well met , Master Antipholus .
When Caesar lived , he durst not thus have moved me .
Withdraw , my lord .
The music , ho !
Why , my young cousin ?
How came she by that light ?
Do you intend it ?
There's no time for a man to recover his hair that grows bald by nature .
I know you .
Hortensio , peace .
And thus it may be .
Thou art translated .
No place will please me so , no mean of death , As here by Caesar , and by you cut off , The choice and master spirits of this age .
Now , good my lord , lie here and rest awhile .
I would scarce trust myself , though I had sworn the contrary , if Hero would be my wife .
The phrase would be more germane to the matter if we could carry cannon by our sides .
They were suborned .
When holy and devout religious men Are at their beads , 'tis much to draw them thence , So sweet is zealous contemplation .
Who knows the Lord Protector's mind herein ?
Let him take thee And hoist thee up to the shouting plebeians !
If I do not love her , I am a Jew .
O God !
Thou most lying slave , Whom stripes may move , not kindness !
Ay , go your ways , go your ways .
The point envenomed too ! , Then , venom , to thy work .
Is this a dagger which I see before me , The handle toward my hand ?
Is thy union here ?
Bear free and patient thoughts .
Very good orators , when they are out , they will spit ; and for lovers lacking , God warn us , matter , the cleanliest shift is to kiss .
Then leave him out .
I'll not believe 't .
I will say nothing .
I will forestall their repair hither and say you are not fit .
Confirmed , confirmed !
Indeed ?
Cleopatra , Think you there was or might be such a man As this I dreamt of ?
Calls my lord ?
The messengers from our sister and the king .
But have I fall'n , or no ?
He plies the duke at morning and at night , And doth impeach the freedom of the state If they deny him justice .
Am I not wise ?
Perhaps some merchant hath invited him , And from the mart he's somewhere gone to dinner .
Where is thy husband now ?
Fare thee well .
Captain Macmorris , when there is more better opportunity to be required , look you , I will be so bold as to tell you I know the disciplines of war , and there is an end .
Is not that neighborly ?
Well be with you , gentlemen .
False to me ?
My father's bears more toward the marketplace .
Still live they , and forever let them last .
Where have you this ?
O noble fool !
As love is , my lord , before it loves .
Who comes here ?
No doubt the murd'rous knife was dull and blunt Till it was whetted on thy stone-hard heart , To revel in the entrails of my lambs .
Now , good sir , what are you ?
I love thee well in that thou lik'st it not .
Out , out , brief candle !
Alas , I sent you money to redeem you By Dromio here , who came in haste for it .
Away !
Who can not want the thought how monstrous It was for Malcolm and for Donalbain To kill their gracious father ?
Give him this money and these notes , Reynaldo .
If it assume my noble father's person , I'll speak to it , though Hell itself should gape And bid me hold my peace .
Lysander , speak again !
Never anger Made good guard for itself .
You know me by my habit .
God quit you in His mercy .
Kent , sir , the banished Kent , who in disguise Followed his enemy king and did him service Improper for a slave .
You have broken The article of your oath , which you shall never Have tongue to charge me with .
Yea , that she did .
Hand in hand with fairy grace Will we sing and bless this place .
A heavy sight !
They say he parted well and paid his score .
Get thee to a nunnery , go .
I know not .
I rest much bounden to you .
A piece of him .
Go you with me and I will use your skill. , Good cousin , have a care this busy time .
How have you known the miseries of your father ?
We should have met you By sea and land , supplying every stage With an augmented greeting .
Why then , resolve me whether you will or no .
Cleopatra Hath nodded him to her .
O , let me speak !
Doth not the gentleman Deserve as full as fortunate a bed As ever Beatrice shall couch upon ?
Affection !
Didst hear her speak ?
Fair sir , I pity her And wish , for her sake more than for mine own , My fortunes were more able to relieve her .
I must be gone .
Portia , forgive me this enforced wrong , And in the hearing of these many friends I swear to thee , even by thine own fair eyes Wherein I see myself , Mark you but that !
On thy love , I charge thee .
Well , well , put up your sword .
A Roman .
A fair name .
Your tale , sir , would cure deafness .
All take hands .
Tis exactly valued , Not petty things admitted .
Or image of that horror ?
Caesar , I shall .

Thou art a boil , A plague-sore or embossed carbuncle In my corrupted blood .
Oh , I am out of breath in this fond chase .
My door is lock'd .
Go back again and be new beaten home ?

Be not afeard .
Yes , marry , sir .
Yet she must die , else she'll betray more men .
Truly , she must be given , or the marriage is not lawful .

Therefore go .
Nay , I beseech you , sir , be not out with me .
Why are you grown so rude ?

I would she had bestowed this dotage on me .
Peace , fool .
It was about to speak when the cock crew .
And the creature run from the cur ?
How now , daughter ?
His father was called Philip of Macedon , as I take it .
Draw , you rascal .
Thus have you heard me severed from my bliss ; That by misfortunes was my life prolonged To tell sad stories of my own mishaps .
Where is the Master , Boatswain ?

Is 't possible ?
Tell Antony Brutus is ta'en .
How now , Lorenzo ?
And for mine own part , I durst not laugh for fear of opening my lips and receiving the bad air .
This day I breathed first .
There's meaning in thy snores .
Here's Decius Brutus .
Poor Tom's a-cold .
Go show your slaves how choleric you are And make your bondmen tremble .
He's gone .
We'll speak to them , and tonight I'll force The wine peep through their scars. , Come on , my Queen , There's sap in 't yet .
Here I am Antony , Yet can not hold this visible shape , my knave .
Before the eyes of both our armies here , Which should perceive nothing but love from us , Let us not wrangle .
He is well paid that is well satisfied .
The sun will not be seen today .
Flower of this purple dye , Hit with Cupid's archery , Sink in apple of his eye .

Why , he's a devil , a devil , a very fiend .
He did receive his letters and is coming .
I should have chid you for not bringing it , But , like a shrew , you first begin to brawl .
I might call him A thing divine , for nothing natural I ever saw so noble .
Shall we see this wrestling , cousin ?
As long as hell and Richard likes of it .
I marvel Cambio comes not all this while .
I am not of many words , but I thank you .
But he protests he loves you And needs no other suitor but his likings To take the safest occasion by the front To bring you in again .
Do it not with poison .
If I speak like myself in this , let him be whipped that first finds it so .
These things are beyond all use , And I do fear them .
In practice let us put it presently .
I do suspect I have done some offense That seems disgracious in the city's eye , And that you come to reprehend my ignorance .
I am satisfied .
It is a tale Told by an idiot , full of sound and fury , Signifying nothing .

Down from the waist they are centaurs , though women all above .
Look where he comes .
And I beseech you instantly to visit My too much changed son .
I should ev'n die with pity To see another thus .
I am glad to see you in this merry vein .
Didst thou not say he comes ?
Pray God , sir , your wife send you not a worse .
Think'st thou I'd make a life of jealousy , To follow still the changes of the moon With fresh suspicions ?

My lord it shall be done .
Our time does call upon 's .
It's nine o'clock .
Now , by Apollo , Now , by Apollo , King , Thou swear'st thy gods in vain .
Farewell , hostess .
But now , Baptista , to your younger daughter .
The last of all the Romans , fare thee well !
Oh , that the slave had forty thousand lives !
Macbeth .
Cleopatra , Why should I think you can be mine , and true , Though you in swearing shake the throned gods , Who have been false to Fulvia ?
Sweet Hero , now thy image doth appear In the rare semblance that I loved it first .
Cheerly , good Adam .
Truly , sir , in respect of a fine workman , I am but , as you would say , a cobbler .
You do mistake your business .
Smile you my speeches as I were a fool ?
Tis from your sister .

Therefore , my lords , omit no happy hour That may give furth'rance to our expedition ; For we have now no thought in us but France , Save those to God , that run before our business .
Farewell till then .
Therefore I pray you lead me to the caskets To try my fortune .
O horror , horror , horror !
Go , some of you , And bring these gentlemen where Hamlet is .
Proceed , Moon .
Or rather bottomless , that as fast as you pour affection in , it runs out .
And will she yet abase her eyes on me , That cropped the golden prime of this sweet prince And made her widow to a woeful bed ?
O notable strumpet !
And I for no woman .
And we'll wear out In a walled prison packs and sects of great ones That ebb and flow by the moon .
Here's France and Burgundy , my noble lord .
If we grow all to be pork-eaters , we shall not shortly have a rasher on the coals for money .

Good gentlemen , let me have leave to speak .
Sir , sir , sir ,
How now , my sweet Bianca !
Now quit you well. , Torches , torches !
Fare-well .
How came you thus recovered ?
Ay , with Cassio .
What sayst thou to him ?
Striving to better , oft we mar what's well .
It is a creature That dotes on Cassio , as 'tis the strumpet's plague To beguile many and be beguiled by one .
What's the matter That you unlace your reputation thus And spend your rich opinion for the name Of a night-brawler ?
And I do not doubt but to hear them say , "It is a sweet comedy." No more words .
Be it as you shall privately determine , Either for her stay or going .
Let me go .
My lord is often thus And hath been from his youth .
Or is the adder better than the eel Because his painted skin contents the eye ?
I'll help you to a horse .
Now , beshrew my father's ambition !
Hanging and wiving goes by destiny .
O fair Katherine , if you will love me soundly with your French heart , I will be glad to hear you confess it brokenly with your English tongue .
They steal hearts .
Let the doors be shut upon him , that he may play the fool no where but in 's own house .
Ay , you did wish that I would make her turn .
Our posts shall be swift and intelligent betwixt us. , Farewell , dear sister .
But did I never speak of all that time ?
So that if we will plant nettles or sow lettuce , set hyssop and weed up thyme , supply it with one gender of herbs or distract it with many , either to have it sterile with idleness , or manured with industry , why , the power and corrigible authority of this lies in our wills .
But manhood is melted into curtsies , valor into compliment , and men are only turned into tongue , and trim ones too .
Thou dost infect mine eyes .
O most pernicious woman !
But the great one that goes up the hill , let him draw thee after .
But art thou not advised , he took some care To get her cunning schoolmasters to instruct her ?
Near and on speedy foot .
Dissolve , thick cloud , and rain , that I may say The gods themselves do weep !
Things that are past are done , with me .
Hast thou forgot her ?
Stand , ho !
Farewell , therefore , Hero .
Since no man of aught he leaves knows , what is 't to leave betimes ?
You wrong me , Brutus .
I would not be mad .
Where virtue is , these are more virtuous .
With what addition ?
I will not stay tonight for all the town .
Cassio , my lord ?
I by bargain should Wear it myself .
A thousand thanks , Signior Gremio .
I fight against thee ?
Let the world see His nobleness well acted , which your death Will never let come forth .
How do you , pretty lady ?
I charge thee , hence , and do not haunt me thus .
That nothing do but meditate on blood , To swearing and stern looks , diffused attire , And everything that seems unnatural .
You speak not as you think .
Antonio , as I heard in Genoa , What , what , what ?
Good sentences , and well pronounced .
Spout , rain !
Do not approach Till thou dost hear me call .
Nor know I aught By me that's said or done amiss this night , Unless self-charity be sometimes a vice , And to defend ourselves it be a sin When violence assails us .
Then take him up and manage well the jest .
She must change for youth .
I shall return before your Lordship thence .
He's in Arthur's bosom , if ever man went to Arthur's bosom .
Fled this way , sir , when by no means he could , Pursue him , ho !
Weigh it but with the grossness of this age , You break not sanctuary in seizing him .
O ye gods , Render me worthy of this noble wife !
Yet this is your harmless fairy , monster .
I am afeard you make a wanton of me .
Let me have audience for a word or two .
Here lie I down and measure out my grave .
If it be found so , some will dear abide it .
I prithee , let thy wife attend on her , And bring them after in the best advantage .
If he be leaden , icy , cold , unwilling , Be thou so too , and so break off the talk , And give us notice of his inclination ; For we tomorrow hold divided councils , Wherein thyself shalt highly be employed .
There's a great abatement of kindness appears as well in the general dependants as in the duke himself also , and your daughter .
Good duke , receive thy daughter .
Then shall we find tomorrow they have only stomachs to eat and none to fight .
Pray now , rest yourself .
Seek him , Titinius , whilst I go to meet The noble Brutus , thrusting this report Into his ears .
Into a thousand that I have forgotten .
Here's our own hands against our hearts .
I will be here again , even with a thought .
Neighbors and friends , though bride and bridegroom wants For to supply the places at the table , You know there wants no junkets at the feast .
Our purposes God justly hath discovered , And I repent my fault more than my death , Which I beseech Your Highness to forgive , Although my body pay the price of it .
My lord , your nobles , jealous of your absence , Seek through your camp to find you .
I must have liberty Withal , as large a charter as the wind , To blow on whom I please , for so fools have .
If thou takest more Or less than a just pound , be it but so much As makes it light or heavy in the substance Or the division of the twentieth part Of one poor scruple , nay , if the scale do turn But in the estimation of a hair , Thou diest and all thy goods are confiscate .
My countrymen , Peace , silence !
Bring him silently .
Know of your youth .
Art thou afeard To be the same in thine own act and valor As thou art in desire ?
Faith , here's an English tailor come hither for stealing out of a French hose .
Therefore thou must be hanged at the state's charge .
This disturbed sky Is not to walk in .
Shall we go seek Benedick and tell him of her love ?
What news ?
Adieu , be vigitant , I beseech you .
God bless your Grace !
In Caesar's fleet Are those that often have 'gainst Pompey fought .
Therefore my son i ' th ' ooze is bedded , and I'll seek him deeper than e'er plummet sounded And with him there lie mudded .
Alack , alack , Edmund , I like not this unnatural dealing .
Barren my wit ?
Shall I say to you , "Let them be free !
We have seen the best of our time .
A better instance , I say .
I pray you , sir , my ring or else the chain .
That "sort" was well fished for .
I am your spaniel .
I meddle with no tradesman's matters nor women's matters , but withal I am indeed , sir , a surgeon to old shoes .
Your old smock brings forth a new petticoat , and indeed the tears live in an onion that should water this sorrow .
The more pity that fools may not speak wisely what wise men do foolishly .
Be large in mirth .
Go , girl .
I'll fetch my sister to get her goodwill .
Turn from me then that noble countenance Wherein the worship of the whole world lies .
Why , man , what is the matter ?
Than my Lord Hastings no man might be bolder .
He is very busy about it .
O treachery !
Arms , arms , sword , fire , corruption in the place !
I'll go with you .
And with my hand I seal my true heart's love .
Tell the clock there .
Soft , comes he not here ?
Sit thee down , Clitus .
Hold , sir , for God's sake !
Tis a pageant , To keep us in false gaze .
Mooncalf , speak once in thy life , if thou beest a good mooncalf .
Well this was Signor Benedick that said so .
I have drunk poison whiles he uttered it .
The wind sits in the shoulder of your sail And you are stayed for .
O , no , he loves me , and he holds me dear .
Well , I will undertake it .
Thou dost snore distinctly .
There shalt thou find my cousin Beatrice Proposing with the Prince and Claudio .
Will 't please your highness walk ?
No .
Into what dangers would you lead me , Cassius , That you would have me seek into myself For that which is not in me ?
I go , I go .
The Emperor calls Canidius .
His daughter and I will be king and queen , save our graces ! , and Trinculo and thyself shall be viceroys. , Dost thou like the plot , Trinculo ?
Believe none of us .
And you , fair sister .
How fares my lord ?
How shall we beguile The lazy time if not with some delight ?
O my daughter , Fled with a Christian !
Very well , my lord .
Therefore the winds , piping to us in vain , As in revenge , have sucked up from the sea Contagious fogs , which falling in the land Have every pelting river made so proud That they have overborne their continents .
Sir , she is mortal .
The round world Should have shook lions into civil streets And citizens to their dens .
Follow , I pray you .
He hath , my lord , of late made many tenders Of his affection to me .
He longs to see your head .
Arise , I say !
No , Caesar , we will answer on their charge .
At home , my lord .
Whip me , ye devils , From the possession of this heavenly sight !
Deny me this , And an eternal curse fall on you !
Therefore , good Emilia , Give me my nightly wearing , and adieu .
No , I am a Welshman .
How now , fellow ?
Thou told'st me Thou didst hold him in thy hate .
I may do that I shall be sorry for .
There is too great testimony in your complexion that it was a passion of earnest .
Why , he that cuts off twenty years of life Cuts off so many years of fearing death .
He speaks well .
What judgment shall I dread , doing no wrong ?
Thank you .
Call you this "gamut" ?
He hath an argosy bound to Tripolis , another to the Indies .
Once more , what news ?
Do , do .
I'll fight at sea .
Ay , that he did .
But if you have a stomach , to 't , i ' God's name : You shall have me assisting you in all .
O cursed , cursed slave !
Therefore beware my censure , and keep your promise .
Flatterers ? , Now , Brutus , thank yourself .
Open , locks , Whoever knocks .
An they will take it , so .
O brave monster !
And , for his passage , The soldiers ' music and the rites of war Speak loudly for him .
Come , we'll to sleep .
My breath and blood !
Cry mercy , lords and watchful gentlemen , That you have ta'en a tardy sluggard here .
The crows and choughs that wing the midway air Show scarce so gross as beetles .
On me , that halts and am misshapen thus ?
Come , I will bring thee to thy bridal chamber .
God rest you merry , sir .
Wherefore this ghastly looking ?
This was sometime a paradox , but now the time gives it proof .
She is protectress of her honor too .
Freedom !
What , is there such a place ?
Here's sport indeed !
I can not be a man with wishing , therefore I will die a woman with grieving .
Make forth .
That very time I saw ( but thou couldst not ) Flying between the cold moon and the Earth , Cupid all armed .
Good morrow to you .
Who chooseth me shall get as much as he deserves." I will assume desert. , Give me a key for this , And instantly unlock my fortunes here .
I forget , But these sweet thoughts do even refresh my labors , Most busiest when I do it .
I am not furnished with the present money .
Swoons rather , for so bad a prayer as his Was never yet for sleep .
My lord , you once did love me .
By my troth , a good song .
Woe to the hand that shed this costly blood !
O Fates , come , come , Cut thread and thrum .
Aunchient Pistol , I do partly understand your meaning .
If he please To give me conquered Egypt for my son , He gives me so much of mine own as I Will kneel to him with thanks .
I prithee , turn aside and weep for her .
Tush , tush , man , never fleer and jest at me .
Balm his foul head in warm distilled waters And burn sweet wood to make the lodging sweet .
My heart is thirsty for that noble pledge .
I have undone three tailors .
Nay , but how dearly he adores Mark Antony !
Why , what a king is this !
It is concluded .
Who could refrain , That had a heart to love , and in that heart Courage to make 's love known ?
I'll not expostulate with her , lest her body and beauty unprovide my mind again , This night , Iago !
In such a time as this it is not meet That every nice offense should bear his comment .
I make all use of it , for I use it only .
Take heed , Signior Baptista , lest you be cony-catched in this business .
Octavius , then take him to follow thee , That did the latest service to my master .
A greater gift ?
Be your tears wet ?
Give me your hand .
Alas , why gnaw you so your nether lip ?
Good Enobarbus , 'tis a worthy deed , And shall become you well , to entreat your captain To soft and gentle speech .
Yea , from the table of my memory I'll wipe away all trivial fond records , All saws of books , all forms , all pressures past That youth and observation copied there , And thy commandment all alone shall live Within the book and volume of my brain , Unmixed with baser matter .
Come , come , you froward and unable worms !
Hortensio , hark .
Why , you gave no gold to me !
Run away , I pray you !
At nine i ' th ' morning here we'll meet again .
What a night's this !
You shall do small respect , show too bold malice Against the grace and person of my master , Stocking his messenger .
You should hear reason .
Now art thou my lieutenant .
Thou art to die .
What if my house be troubled with a rat And I be pleased to give ten thousand ducats To have it baned ?
Her hair , what color ?
Were he not warmed with ale , This were a bed but cold to sleep so soundly .
I am he that is so love-shaked .
But come , your Bergomask .
No , my good lord .
No , it begins again .
What dost thou with thy best apparel on ?
You can not feed capons so .
Repose you there , while I to this hard house , More harder than the stones whereof 'tis raised , Which even but now , demanding after you , Denied me to come in , return , and force Their scanted courtesy .
To her , widow !
I see two husbands , or mine eyes deceive me .
The king his master needs must take it ill , That he , so slightly valued in his messenger , Should have him thus restrained .
My Lord of Oxford , you , Sir William Brandon , And you , Sir Walter Herbert , stay with me .
Never come such division 'tween our souls .
I am glad of your departure .
I'll call upon you straight .
Never till this day Saw I him touched with anger so distempered .
Thou knowest that the fashion of a doublet , or a hat , or a cloak , is nothing to a man .
My lord ?
I'll bring thee word Straight how 'tis like to go .
The Prince and Monsieur Love !
Has he never before sounded you in this business ?
Oh , my pardon !
O hated potion , hence !
Trinculo , if you trouble him any more in 's tale , by this hand , I will supplant some of your teeth .
Good night , good night .
So Chrish save me , I will cut off your head .
Ay , 'twas he that told me on her first .
I , sir ?
We must out and talk .
Alack , what trouble Was I then to you !
Go , prick thy face and over-red thy fear , Thou lily-livered boy .
As ignorant as dirt !
Thou hast served me with much faith .
Enjoy the honey-heavy dew of slumber .
And must they all be hanged that swear and lie ?
Lo , yonder , and Titinius mourning it .
All's but naught .
Your goods that lay at host , sir , in the Centaur .
If you have poison for me , I will drink it .
Why , she hath a face of her own .
I have brought him a present .
For the which I hear what they say of him .
Dispatch us with all speed , lest that our king Come here himself to question our delay , For he is footed in this land already .
If that thou be'st a devil , I can not kill thee .
Though far more cause , yet much less spirit to curse Abides in me .
Is she to be buried in Christian burial when she willfully seeks her own salvation ?
Come , wherefore should you be so pashful ?
I'll to my book , For yet ere supper-time must I perform Much business appertaining .
Oh , how I love thee !
Set on thy wife to observe .
And did not they Put on my brows this wreath of victory And bid me give it thee ?
A substitute shines brightly as a king Until a king be by , and then his state Empties itself , as doth an inland brook Into the main of waters .
How , in stripping it , You more invest it !
Who sued to me for him ?
Ay , sir .
Wondrous heavy .
And I for Rosalind .
God bless me from a challenge !
For Oberon is passing fell and wrath Because that she , as her attendant hath A lovely boy stolen from an Indian king .
Sit down and feed , and welcome to our table .
It is the prince of palfreys .
Why ever wast thou lovely in my eyes ?
Pray you , is he married to Cleopatra ?
What is he for a fool that betroths himself to unquietness ?
What's your highness' pleasure ?
No , none that thou hast wit enough to make .
When this advice is free I give and honest , Probal to thinking and indeed the course To win the Moor again ?
If the cat will after kind , So , be sure , will Rosalind .
Mine honor was not yielded , But conquered merely .
You forget yourself To hedge me in .
Bring it to that , The gold I give thee will I melt and pour Down thy ill-uttering throat .
These foolish drops do something drown my manly spirit .
Meantime we thank you for your well-took labor .
What black magician conjures up this fiend To stop devoted charitable deeds ?
Both of you Know Banquo was your enemy .
I am their mother .
Jailer , look to him .
If I were bound to divine of this unity , I would not prophesy so .
I scorn you not .
Speak , Agrippa .
Get me some poison , Iago , this night .
Yet bend not all the harm upon yourself .
Friends , Romans , countrymen , lend me your ears .
Why , give it to my wife , and fetch your money .
Well , I'll be revenged as I may .
Do you not hear me speak ?
Good Master Peaseblossom , I shall desire you of more acquaintance too. , Your name , I beseech you , sir ?
He misses not much .
Your eldest daughters have fordone themselves , And desperately are dead .
I know thee , Roderigo .
And your reports have set the murder on .
No medicine in the world can do thee good .
A contract of true love to celebrate , And some donation freely to estate On the blessed lovers .
I will owe thee an answer for that .
Nay , guiltiness Will speak , though tongues were out of use .
Let us to the field .
Tis such another fitchew .
I think the duke will not be spoke withal .
This contents .
Poor soul !
Would they were basilisks to strike thee dead .
Kent , on thy life , no more .
God be with you .
The fiend gives the more friendly counsel .
I have noted it well .
He hath some meaning in his mad attire .
Believe me , sir , It carries a brave form .
A horned man's a monster and a beast .
Most monsterlike be shown For poor'st diminutives , for dolts , and let Patient Octavia plow thy visage up With her prepared nails !
Now , Signior , where's the Count ?
I'll buckler thee against a million .
If thou account'st it shame , lay it on me , And therefore frolic !
I warrant thee .
The princes both make high account of you , I know they do , and I have well deserved it .
If more thou dost perceive , let me know more .
So let him land , And solemnly see him set on to London .
And your experience makes you sad .
Rebels it at these years ?
And so do I too , lieutenant .
A privilege never to see me more .
O dear father , It is thy business that I go about .
Come away .
Prithee , put up .
Have more than thou showest , Speak less than thou knowest , Lend less than thou owest , Ride more than thou goest , Learn more than thou trowest , Set less than thou throwest , Leave thy drink and thy whore And keep in-a-door , And thou shalt have more Than two tens to a score .
Judge me , you gods !
But while I say one prayer !
I never saw my father in my life .
Why , what you will .
And all for nothing , For Hecuba !
This is the air-drawn dagger which you said Led you to Duncan .
What should I do with him ?
Away !
Thanks , you the valiant of this warlike isle That so approve the Moor .
Well , sir , learn to jest in good time .
Now , banished Kent , If thou canst serve where thou dost stand condemned , So may it come thy master , whom thou lovest , Shall find thee full of labors .
Had I plantation of this isle , my lord , He'd sow 't with nettle seed .
Thou 'dst never fear the net nor lime , The pitfall nor the gin .
Come , thou tortoise !
This tune goes manly .
You are a councilor .
It is even so .
What was the last cry for ?
Come , Dromio , come , these jests are out of season .
Goneril with a white beard ?
Go to , you are too shrewd .
Give me , " quoth I .
Say , "the brave Antony." The valiant Caesar !
Oh , I have suffered With those that I saw suffer .
And therefore is he idle ?
I doubt some danger does approach you nearly .
And , being done , thus Wall away doth go .
Why ?
I passed , methought , the melancholy flood , With that sour ferryman which poets write of , Unto the kingdom of perpetual night .
Of Albany's and Cornwall's powers you heard not ?
Tell us the manner of it , gentle Casca .
Indeed , he is so .
She has robbed me of my sword .
If he were dead , what would betide on me ?
You have prevailed .
Thou art come to answer A stony adversary , an inhuman wretch Uncapable of pity , void and empty From any dram of mercy .
I hope , in no place so unsanctified Where such as thou mayst find him .
I dare assure thee that no enemy Shall ever take alive the noble Brutus .
Who shall stay you ?
Ariel , thy charge Exactly is performed .
Peace !
The ground indeed is tawny .
That it would please you leave these sad designs To him that hath more cause to be a mourner , And presently repair to Crosby House , Where , after I have solemnly interred At Chertsey monast'ry this noble king And wet his grave with my repentant tears , I will with all expedient duty see you .
I know I can not please you .
A plague upon you , murderers , traitors all !
Till then , enough .
Edmund I think is gone In pity of his misery to dispatch His nighted life ; moreover to descry The strength o ' th ' enemy .
And so fare thee well .
I am afeard there are few die well that die in a battle , for how can they charitably dispose of anything , when blood is their argument ?
He comes to kill my heart .
The Jove of power make me most weak , most weak , Your reconciler !
What manner of man ?
We will be witnesses .
What do you mean , my lord ?
Your cause of sorrow Must not be measured by his worth , for then It hath no end .
And , friends , disperse yourselves .
Fellows , let's be gone .
No , sir , God forbid , but ashamed to kiss .
No , Pompey , I have kept me from the cup .
I am bound to hear .
But was not this nigh shore ?
Let heaven and men and devils , let them all , All , all cry shame against me , yet I'll speak .
There !
My father charged you in his will to give me good education .
The power of Caesar , and His power unto Octavia .
Here , stand behind this bulk , straight will he come .
Behold , there stand the caskets , noble Prince .
In faith , she's too curst .
He sought my life , But lately , very late .
And I'll sleep .
That may be , for you bear a many superfluously , and 'twere more honor some were away .
What man is that ?
These are unsightly tricks .
He is indeed a horse , and all other jades you may call beasts .
Lysander , whereto tends all this ?
Nay , then , thou mock'st me .
Had my lips that power , Thus would I wear them out .
Goats and monkeys !
For you know , nuncle , The hedge-sparrow fed the cuckoo so long , That it's had it head bit off by it young .
Yet here's a spot .
Shall we clap into 't roundly , without hawking or spitting or saying we are hoarse , which are the only prologues to a bad voice ?
Let's ha ' 't , good Grumio .
A peevish schoolboy , worthless of such honor , Joined with a masker and a reveler !
See this dispatched with all the haste thou canst : Anon I'll give thee more instructions .
No , I protest , I know not the contents .
She is not well .
I did so , and take heed on 't , Make it a darling like your precious eye .
Gower is a good captain , and is good knowledge and literatured in the wars .
Heard you of nothing strange about the streets ?
And yesternight , at supper , You suddenly arose and walked about , Musing and sighing , with your arms across , And when I asked you what the matter was , You stared upon me with ungentle looks .
Hark !
Speak once again .
There's more depends on this than on the value .
Prithee , say on .
Nay , go not back .
Mark how the tyrant writes .
Yet he hath ever but slenderly known himself .
What sights , my lord ?
Truly , the tree yields bad fruit .
Thus I'll visit her .
What he hath uttered I have writ my sister .
I am not married , Caesar .
That song tonight Will not go from my mind .
Yes .
Then is he more beholding to you than I .
Farewell the neighing steed and the shrill trump , The spirit-stirring drum , th ' ear-piercing fife , The royal banner , and all quality , Pride , pomp , and circumstance of glorious war !
What , have you forgot me ?
For this reason , if you'll know : That she's the choice love of Signior Gremio .
One thing more rests , that thyself execute , to make one among these wooers .
So it should be , that none but Antony Should conquer Antony , but woe 'tis so !
Did I deserve no more than a fool's head ?
Write to me very shortly , And you shall understand from me her mind .
He shall live a man forbid .
I shall be saved by my husband .
Thither must I , and here I leave you , sir .
Why look you strange on me ?
Under Captain Gower , my liege .
So they are .
If she live long , And in the end meet the old course of death , Women will all turn monsters .
Burn !
Where art thou , Death ?
Your bedchamber .
Or else it stood upon the choice of friends , O hell , to choose love by another's eyes !
Sir , in fine , Seeing how loathly opposite I stood To his unnatural purpose , in fell motion , With his prepared sword he charges home My unprovided body , latched mine arm .
Lend thy hand And pluck my magic garment from me .
Art thou learned ?
Tis wonderful .
The herb I showed thee once .
Think yourself a baby That you have ta'en these tenders for true pay , Which are not sterling .
Thus I do escape the sorrow Of Antony's death .
This were kindness .
Enough to purchase what you have made known .
As you are old and reverend , should be wise .
Fled to his house amazed .
Is it possible that any villainy should be so dear ?
Take no offense that I would not offend you .
Though I die for it , as no less is threatened me , the king my old master must be relieved .
Farewell .
Like her ?
Madam , I heard her speak .
He gives you upon his knees a thousand thanks , and he esteems himself happy that he hath fall'n into the hands of one , as he thinks , the most brave , valorous , and thrice- worthy seigneur of England .
Let me shun that .
If he do fear God , he must necessarily keep peace .
Even such a husband Hast thou of me as she is for a wife .
Ay , springes to catch woodcocks .
Oh , brave Iago , honest and just , That hast such noble sense of thy friend's wrong !
If he be absent , bring his brother to me .
And , but for ceremony , such a wretch , Winding up days with toil and nights with sleep , Had the forehand and vantage of a king .
If thou didst ever thy dear father love , O God !
Besides , his cote , his flocks , and bounds of feed Are now on sale , and at our sheepcote now , By reason of his absence , there is nothing That you will feed on .
My cousin Westmoreland ?
I thank you .
Ram thou thy fruitful tidings in mine ears , That long time have been barren .
So that in these ten thousand they have lost , There are but sixteen hundred mercenaries .
Here comes the herald of the French , my liege .
Rather a ditch in Egypt Be gentle grave unto me .
What , are the brothers parted ?
I doubt not that , since we are well-persuaded We carry not a heart with us from hence That grows not in a fair consent with ours , Nor leave not one behind that doth not wish Success and conquest to attend on us .
There is no harm intended to your person , Nor to no Roman else .
What is your will ?
Oh , you and I have heard our fathers say , There was a Brutus once that would have brooked Th ' eternal devil to keep his state in Rome As easily as a king .
Ay , so please your Majesty .
Be wary , then .
Now let me see if I can conster it .
Most mighty duke , vouchsafe me speak a word .
Use Desdemona well .
Let her have your voice .
They are in the very wrath of love , and they will together .
Skipper , stand back .
Crowner's quest law .
And , you know , his means , If he improve them , may well stretch so far As to annoy us all ; which to prevent , Let Antony and Caesar fall together .
And of women .
Gentlemen , forward to the bridal dinner .
Here , madam : Conster them .
I'll have her , but I will not keep her long .
Win me and wear me !
I had as lief have a reed that will do me no service as a partisan I could not heave .
How canst thou urge God's dreadful law to us When thou hast broke it in such dear degree ?
Hop in his walks and gambol in his eyes .
Nay , more , if any born at Ephesus Be seen at any Syracusian marts and fairs ; Again , if any Syracusian born Come to the bay of Ephesus , he dies , His goods confiscate to the Duke's dispose , Unless a thousand marks be levied To quit the penalty and to ransom him .
And yet , to say the truth , reason and love keep little company together nowadays .
Anon , anon !
Would I were so too .
Then half Signor Benedick's tongue in Count John's mouth , and half Count John's melancholy in Signor Benedick's face , With a good leg and a good foot , uncle , and money enough in his purse , such a man would win any woman in the world , if he could get her goodwill .
But are you so much in love as your rhymes speak ?
Away !
He lies tonight within seven leagues of Rome .
Know him I shall , I am well sure of it .
The devil take order now !
Why , what canst thou tell , my boy ?
His countenance likes me not .
Clarence still breathes ; Edward still lives and reigns .
If ever thou wilt thrive , bury my body .
Why , art thou mad , old fellow ?
Inquire me out some mean poor gentleman , Whom I will marry straight to Clarence ' daughter .
This is nothing , Fool .
Have done thy charm , thou hateful , withered hag .
But 'tis not so .
O , unpleasing news !
No passage ?
Tell her I am arrested in the street , And that shall bail me .
I pray you , go Along with me .
All ?
Your son , my lord , has paid a soldier's debt .
Presently .
Call Philostrate .
Fair princess , you have lost much good sport .
Caesar , I shall .
My language !
God , the best maker of all marriages , Combine your hearts in one , your realms in one .
Yours by this hand .
If you grow foul with me , Pistol , I will scour you with my rapier , as I may , in fair terms .
My mistress with a monster is in love .
Is it two days ago since I tripped up thy heels and beat thee before the king ?
Othello ?
O , good my lord , tax not so bad a voice To slander music anymore than once .
Have you done yet ?
Down with him , thief !
Is it not as this mouth should tear this hand For lifting food to 't ?
Caesar , thou art revenged , Even with the sword that killed thee .
Tis very grievous to be thought upon .
Speak .
She can not be so much without true judgment , Having so swift and excellent a wit As she is prized to have , as to refuse So rare a gentleman as Signior Benedick .
No , faith , die by attorney .
My mistress here lies murdered in her bed , Oh , heavens forfend !
O inhuman dog !
Would all the world but he had quite forsworn !
Now am I Dromio , and his man , unbound .
I am content you shall entreat me stay , But yet not stay , entreat me how you can .
Let us not leave him out .
She hath spied him already with those sweet eyes .
Nay , do not pause ; for I did kill King Henry , But 'twas thy beauty that provoked me .
Peace , peace , Iras .
The son of Clarence have I pent up close , His daughter meanly have I matched in marriage , The sons of Edward sleep in Abraham's bosom , And Anne my wife hath bid this world goodnight .
Put color in thy cheek .
Why , then , we kill all our women .
You tell us the manner of the wrestling .
Was Milan thrust from Milan , that his issue Should become kings of Naples ?
O , he was gentle , mild , and virtuous .
We first address towards you , who with this king Hath rivaled for our daughter .
By what ?
All torment , trouble , wonder , and amazement Inhabits here .
Nay , I pray you let me go .
Nay , it is possible enough to judgment .
And I with him .
Poor lady , she'll run mad When she shall lack it .
Why is this "impawned , " as you call it ?
You have killed a sweet lady , and her death shall fall heavy on you .
Believe not so .
The more my wrong , the more his spite appears .
I'll halt after .
What , did Caesar swoon ?
Woo't fight ?
Let me go with you .
She's gone forever .
Oh , why rebuke you him that loves you so ?
Fetch me this herb , and be thou here again Ere the leviathan can swim a league .
Put on what weary negligence you please , You and your fellow servants .
So our leader's led , And we are women's men .
Good morrow , neighbor Gremio. , God save you , gentlemen !
Bid me farewell .
Good night then , Casca .
In happy time , Iago .
What comfortable hour canst thou name , That ever graced me in thy company ?
Do you see yonder cloud that's almost in shape of a camel ?
Report is changeable .
So am I purposed .
But it is no matter .
Bear them from hence .
It is very sultry , as 'twere , I can not tell how .
Most noble brother , you have done me wrong .
I had as lief thou didst break his neck as his finger .
It is to be all made of sighs and tears , And so am I for Phoebe .
Oh , defend me !
Let's meet him and receive him .
On him I lay what you would lay on me , The right and fortune of his happy stars , Which God defend that I should wring from him .
Again !
Nay , press not so upon me .
Though his bark can not be lost , Yet it shall be tempest-tossed .
How parted he with thee ?
It is the wittiest partition that ever I heard discourse , my lord .
That's not so good .
They will scarcely believe this without trial .
Fair Katherine , and most fair , Will you vouchsafe to teach a soldier terms Such as will enter at a lady's ear And plead his love suit to her gentle heart ?
As thou art to thyself .
Most mischievous foul sin in chiding sin , For thou thyself hast been a libertine , As sensual as the brutish sting itself , And all th ' embossed sores and headed evils That thou with license of free foot hast caught Wouldst thou disgorge into the general world .
Where lodges he ?
By my soul I swear There is no power in the tongue of man To alter me .
For I have neither wit nor words nor worth , Action nor utterance nor the power of speech , To stir men's blood .
A noble prisoner !
My father was no traitor .
A gallant curtal-axe upon my thigh , A boar-spear in my hand , and in my heart Lie there what hidden woman's fear there will , We'll have a swashing and a martial outside , As many other mannish cowards have That do outface it with their semblances .
Faith , sir , you need not fear .
And there is a forerunner come from a fifth , the Prince of Morocco , who brings word the prince his master will be here tonight .
Trinculo , keep a good tongue in your head .
I do hear the morning lark .
Himself in person there ?
Sir , his chests and treasure He has not with him .
They are his shards , and he
Her name is Portia , nothing undervalued To Cato's daughter , Brutus ' Portia .
It is a massy wheel Fixed on the summit of the highest mount , To whose huge spokes ten thousand lesser things Are mortised and adjoined , which , when it falls , Each small annexment , petty consequence , Attends the boisterous ruin .
If a Jew wrong a Christian , what is his humility ?
There lies the duke asleep , and there the keys .
Had you not come upon your cue , my lord , William Lord Hastings had pronounced your part , I mean your voice for crowning of the king .
I saw Bassanio and Antonio part .
And aroint thee , witch , aroint thee !
And if it stand , as you yourself still do , Within the eye of honor , be assured My purse , my person , my extremest means Lie all unlocked to your occasions .
Alack , sir , he is mad .
Good my lord , enter .
When I did make thee free , swor'st thou not then To do this when I bade thee ?
Perchance 'Twill walk again .
It was ourself thou didst abuse .
I would cure you if you would but call me Rosalind and come every day to my cote and woo me .
Unhappy that I am , I can not heave My heart into my mouth .
Can you inquire him out and be edified by report ?
Nay , but who is it ?
Alas , I am the mother of these griefs .
Which soon he granted , Being an obstruct 'tween his lust and him .
But what prevention ?
And did you see the handkerchief ?
The text is foolish .
How poor are they that have not patience !
Therefore let Benedick , like covered fire , Consume away in sighs , waste inwardly .
At such a time I'll loose my daughter to him .
O , she would laugh me Out of myself , press me to death with wit .
Be angry when you will , it shall have scope .
You stand .
Trouble us not .
The one is too like an image and says nothing , and the other too like my lady's eldest son , evermore tattling .
Alas , I rather hate myself For hateful deeds committed by myself .
She did indeed .
Never hung poison on a fouler toad .
Would not they speak ?
You will be whipped .
Not in love neither ?
The gods defend her ! , hear him hence awhile .
The whole butt , man .
Alas , she hath from France too long been chased , And all her husbandry doth lie on heaps , Corrupting in its own fertility .
Upon your sword Sit laurel victory , and smooth success Be strewed before your feet .
Twas full two years ere I could get a tooth .
The king hath note of all that they intend , By interception which they dream not of .
Now do I see 'tis true .
I reasoned with a Frenchman yesterday , Who told me , in the narrow seas that part The French and English , there miscarried A vessel of our country richly fraught .
I say , by sorcery he got this isle .
What men have you lost , Fluellen ?
But there's no goodness in thy face , if Antony Be free and healthful , so tart a favor To trumpet such good tidings !
For those that mingle reason with your passion Must be content to think you old , and so , But she knows what she does .
Here at the door .
Thou , my slave , As thou report'st thyself , wast then her servant .
Untimely storms make men expect a dearth .
I pray you , will you take him by the arm ?
Why , it stood by her .
Come , bird , come .
This sword but shown to Caesar , with this tidings , Shall enter me with him .
Because we come to do you service and you think we are ruffians , you'll have your daughter covered with a Barbary horse .
I shall attend you presently at your tent .
Front to front Bring thou this fiend of Scotland and myself .
Bring us the letter .
There is a litter ready .
Murder and treason !
Music , moody food Of us that trade in love .
Lady Beatrice , have you wept all this while ?
Well , I am not fair , and therefore I pray the gods make me honest .
But fare you well .
Captain Fluellen .
This to be true I do engage my life .
So please my lord the duke and all the court , To quit the fine for one half of his goods I am content , so he will let me have The other half in use to render it Upon his death unto the gentleman That lately stole his daughter .
I warrant it will .
Nothing , my lord .
That will be ere the set of sun .
Was not that Cassio parted from my wife ?
And me too , good Lord !
But we have reason to cool our raging motions , our carnal stings , our unbitted lusts .
What means this shouting ?
The king , His brother , and yours , abide all three distracted , And the remainder mourning over them , Brimful of sorrow and dismay .
Judge , O you gods , how dearly Caesar loved him !
What touches us ourself shall be last served .
All there is thine .
You shall not gauge me By what we do tonight .
I see , sir , you are liberal in offers .
Oh , that a man might know The end of this day's business ere it come !
No more , cousin .
The day is spent .
Hark , Tranio !
Oh , the world hath not a sweeter creature , she might lie by an emperor's side and command him tasks .
I have a venturous fairy that shall seek The squirrel's hoard and fetch thee new nuts .
Your power and your command is taken off And Cassio rules in Cyprus .
She will not come .
My wife killed too ?
He never did harm that I heard of .
Her name is Katherina Minola , Renowned in Padua for her scolding tongue .
Take your place .
Ay .
I will do so .
And so we will , provided that he win her .
Was ever man so weary ?
Everyone hears that That can distinguish sound .
Oh , sweet England !
Tis nine o'clock .
Smile heaven upon this fair conjunction , That long have frowned upon their enmity .
Me , a groat ?
Why , that's the way To fool their preparation and to conquer Their most absurd intents .
Sir , you say well , and well you do conceive .
Nothing extenuate , Nor set down aught in malice .
What was he , sad or merry ?
Alas , the storm is come again !
Horrible steep .
You shall read us the will , Caesar's will .
Tis to be doubted , madam .
And wilt thou have me ?
Alas , poor caitiff !
You sent me to the bay , sir , for a bark .
I would have daffed all other respects and made her half myself .
He speaks to me. , I am your master , Dromio .
There came divers of Antonio's creditors in my company to Venice that swear he can not choose but break .
No farther than the Tower , and , as I guess , Upon the like devotion as yourselves , To gratulate the gentle princes there .
I am maimed for ever .
Let me know .
His captain's heart , Which in the scuffles of great fights hath burst The buckles on his breast , reneges all temper And is become the bellows and the fan To cool a gypsy's lust .
He that is giddy thinks the world turns round" , I pray you , tell me what you meant by that .
A solemn air and the best comforter To an unsettled fancy cure thy brains , Now useless , boiled within thy skull. , There stand , For you are spell-stopped. , Mine eyes , ev'n sociable to the show of thine , Fall fellowly drops .
Why do you cross me in this exigent ?
Now could I drink hot blood And do such bitter business as the bitter day Would quake to look on .
Where is she now ? , What , will these hands ne'er be clean ? , No more o ' that , my lord , no more o ' that .
An the duke had not given him sixpence a day for playing Pyramus , I'll be hanged .
Sure he hath killed his wife .
Went they not quickly , I should die with laughing .
And thus she means , videlicet , Asleep , my love ?
How cheerest thou , Jessica ?
I would she were in heaven , so she could Entreat some power to change this currish Jew .
What , with Lysander ?
They call it Agincourt .
I can stay with Regan , I and my hundred knights .
You're fall'n into a princely hand .
I am one , my liege , Whom the vile blows and buffets of the world Have so incensed that I am reckless what I do to spite the world .
I marvel why I answered not again .
The iron tongue of midnight hath told twelve .
You shall have leave .
He is a proper man's picture , but alas , who can converse with a dumb show ?
Then shall I swear to Kate , and you to me , And may our oaths well kept and prosp'rous be .
From France there comes a power Into this scattered kingdom , who already , Wise in our negligence , have secret feet In some of our best ports and are at point To show their open banner .
The Lord in heaven bless thee , noble Harry !
Bring him with triumph home unto his house !
Do not torment me , prithee .
Have all his ventures failed ?
We must die , Messala .
My boon I make it that you know me not Till time and I think meet .
You say he dined at home ; the goldsmith here Denies that saying .
O earth , which this blood drink'st revenge his death !
Intelligence is given where you are hid .
I think he only loves the world for him .
Come , shall we go and kill us venison ?
Think and die .
O ye immortal gods !
I weigh it lightly , were it heavier .
One dead , or drunk ?
Now , my lord .
His life was gentle , and the elements So mixed in him that Nature might stand up And say to all the world , "This was a man." According to his virtue let us use him , With all respect and rites of burial .
Nor I .
Faith , e'en with losing his wits .
I am quickly ill , and well , So Antony loves .
Say she be mute and will not speak a word ; Then I'll commend her volubility , And say she uttereth piercing eloquence .
A lean cheek , which you have not ; a blue eye and sunken , which you have not ; an unquestionable spirit , which you have not ; a beard neglected , which you have not , but I pardon you for that , for simply your having in beard is a younger brother's revenue .
Wilt break my heart ?
Sir , you speak nobly .
O Iago !
He that has the two fair daughters , is 't he you mean ?
On , to the field !
I have a journey , sir , shortly to go .
There are some shrewd contents in yond same paper That steals the color from Bassanio's cheek .
Shall I entreat a word ?
Murder !
The players can not keep counsel .
Treachery !
But in your daughter's womb I bury them , Where , in that nest of spicery , they will breed Selves of themselves , to your recomforture .
But wherefore art not in thy shop today ?
But you and I And honest Casca , we have the falling sickness .
Tarry , Jew .
Who knows not that the gentle duke is dead ?
By our beards ( if we had them ) , thou art .
Believe me , lord , I think he can not choose .
He is all the mother's , from the top to toe .
Why , then , take no note of him , but let him go and presently call the rest of the watch together and thank God you are rid of a knave .
My hair doth stand an end to hear her curses .
Can it be possible that no man saw them ?
Rather make My country's high pyramides my gibbet And hang me up in chains !
I could never better stead thee than now .
Why should the poor be flattered ?
And let my liver rather heat with wine Than my heart cool with mortifying groans .
Speak , man .
Whither should I fly ?
Hence , horrible villain , or I'll spurn thine eyes Like balls before me !
Not that we love words better , as you do .
Well , sit we down , And let us hear Barnardo speak of this .
I am no villain .
If you knew my business , You would entreat me rather go than stay .
How goes it with my brave Mark Antony ?
Bruised pieces , go .
Ay , my good lord .
Good news , good news !
I have seen thee fight When I have envied thy behavior .
Vex not his prescience .
This is the silliest stuff that ever I heard .
Not till you have slept .
The wren goes to 't , and the small gilded fly does lecher in my sight .
Why , would not you ?
Is Antony or we in fault for this ?
That shall be by and by .
Stars , my lord .
I can not tell ; I think not .
I desire no more delight Than to be under sail and gone tonight .
How long have you been a sectary astronomical ?
He's married , madam .
Let's meet as little as we can .
There my Lysander and myself shall meet .
I will go seek him. , Cassio , walk hereabout .
The rest are princes , barons , lords , knights , squires , And gentlemen of blood and quality .
Your shoes is not so good .
So do I ever For had I cursed now , I had cursed myself .
It shall advantage more than do us wrong .
Presently away , For to strange sores strangely they strain the cure. , Come , lady , die to live .
What were I best to say ?
We do , my lord .
My name is Edgar , and thy father's son .
Good sister , let us dine and never fret .
Wherefore's this noise ?
No , great king .
Whoever bound him , I will loose his bonds And gain a husband by his liberty. , Speak , old Egeon , if thou be'st the man That hadst a wife once called Emilia , That bore thee at a burden two fair sons .
Here comes the man you mean .
With him I sent the queen , My reason all the same , and they are ready Tomorrow or at further space t ' appear Where you shall hold your session .
I tell you what you shall do .
O my dear lord , Nay , do not think I flatter .
No ?
Trouble yourselves no further .
With any strong or vehement importunity .
This is the man , this is Antonio , To whom I am so infinitely bound .
But such officers do the king best service in the end .
But I would be loath to fall into my dreams again .
If the matter were good , my lord , I durst swear it were his .
Oh , woe the day !
But I remember now I am in this earthly world , where to do harm Is often laudable , to do good sometime Accounted dangerous folly .
Had all his hairs been lives My great revenge had stomach for them all .
That same cowardly , giantlike ox-beef hath devoured many a gentleman of your house .
None .
Seek , seek for him , Lest his ungoverned rage dissolve the life That wants the means to lead it .
In this time of the night ?
Pray heaven it be State matters , as you think , and no conception Nor no jealous toy concerning you .
O coz , coz , coz , my pretty little coz , that thou didst know how many fathom deep I am in love .
It was great ignorance , Gloucester's eyes being out , To let him live .
If to have done the thing you gave in charge Beget your happiness , be happy then , For it is done .
Indeed , upon my sword , indeed .
Dromio , nor thou ?
I shall devise something .
For the Queen , I'll take her to my guard .
Adieu .
Ah , that good Kent , He said it would be thus , poor banished man .
Which of these is he ?
On me , whose all not equals Edward's moiety ?
To a nunnery , go .
O Cassius , Brutus gave the word too early , Who , having some advantage on Octavius , Took it too eagerly .
How shall I know thee again ?
He knows not yet of his honorable fortune .
Persever , counterfeit sad looks , Make mouths upon me when I turn my back , Wink each at other , hold the sweet jest up , This sport , well carried , shall be chronicled .
As he was valiant , I honor him .
And know it now : the senate have concluded To give this day a crown to mighty Caesar .
So frowned he once when , in an angry parle , He smote the sledded Polacks on the ice .
What is , my lord ?
Upon the stroke of ten .
By the mass , I was about to say something .
Forever and forever farewell , Cassius .
Enjoy thy plainness .
I go , my lord .
Let me shake thy hand .
But he , poor man , by your first order died , And that a winged Mercury did bear .
You shall not find , Though you be therein curious , the least cause For what you seem to fear .
All of us have cause To wail the dimming of our shining star , But none can help our harms by wailing them. , Madam , my mother , I do cry you mercy ; I did not see your Grace .
Sing it .
The duke my father loved his father dearly .
Neither my husband nor the slave returned That in such haste I sent to seek his master ?
If you pardon , we will mend .
Your Grace is too costly to wear every day .
Not today , O Lord , Oh , not today , think not upon the fault My father made in compassing the crown .
It is no matter .
Either thou , Macbeth , Or else my sword with an unbattered edge I sheathe again undeeded .
The queen your mother , in most great affliction of spirit , hath sent me to you .
A beggar , brother ?
If sight and shape be true , Why then , my love adieu .
What , have you lost your wits ?
I owe you much , and , like a willful youth , That which I owe is lost .
Sir , He is with Caesar .
Any bar , any cross , any impediment will be med'cinable to me .
Content .
Fed with the same food , hurt with the same weapons , subject to the same diseases , healed by the same means , warmed and cooled by the same winter and summer as a Christian is ?
Come like shadows ; so depart !
When think you that the sword goes up again ?
In the way of argument , look you , and friendly communication , partly to satisfy my opinion , and partly for the satisfaction , look you , of my mind , as touching the direction of the military discipline , that is the point .
Why should calamity be full of words ?
Moreover that we much did long to see you , The need we have to use you did provoke Our hasty sending .
Go fetch them hither .
He's a good fellow , I can tell you that .
But yet methinks it is very sultry and hot for my complexion .
Lucentio , gentle sir .
Who can arraign me for 't ?
Excellent , i ' faith , of the chameleon's dish .
He hath not touched you yet .
And when your honors mean to solemnize The bargain of your faith , I do beseech you Even at that time I may be married too .
Go to , charm your tongue .
All for your delight We are not here .
He does make our fire , Fetch in our wood , and serves in offices That profit us. , What , ho !
You know the character to be your brother's ?
For not alone The death of Fulvia , with more urgent touches , Do strongly speak to us , but the letters too Of many our contriving friends in Rome Petition us at home .
I would I had thy inches .
Lord of his fortunes he salutes thee , and Requires to live in Egypt ; which not granted , He lessens his requests , and to thee sues To let him breathe between the heavens and earth A private man in Athens .
My lord , my lord , I'll prove it on his body if he dare , Despite his nice fence and his active practice , His May of youth and bloom of lustihood .
Take it , God , For it is none but thine .
He that knows better how to tame a shrew , Now let him speak ; 'tis charity to show .
Sans fable , she herself reviled you there .
Did you send to him , sir ?
By Cheshu , I think he will plow up all if there is not better directions .
Where I have come , great clerks have purposed To greet me with premeditated welcomes , Where I have seen them shiver and look pale , Make periods in the midst of sentences , Throttle their practiced accent in their fears , And in conclusion dumbly have broke off , Not paying me a welcome .
Do not abuse me .
You know not Whether it was his wisdom or his fear .
Pray you , let's sit together .
I have not art to reckon my groans , but that I love thee best , oh , most best , believe it .
He that is robbed , not wanting what is stol'n , Let him not know't , and he's not robbed at all .
Swagger ?
Pray , do not mock me .
With duty and desire we follow you .
Love , and be friends as two such men should be .
Soft , no haste .
Fill , Lucius , till the wine o'erswell the cup .
I ' faith , sir , you shall never need to fear .
Hark , what noise is this ?
Ay , and I'll give them him without a fee .
No further , sir .
Lesser than Macbeth and greater .
Therefore you must needs play Pyramus .
Thus hath he lost sixpence a day during his life .
How is 't with me when every noise appals me ?
And what have kings that privates have not too , Save ceremony , save general ceremony ?
May a man do it ?
We must not now displease him .
So fare you well .
Stand from the body .
I must not say no .
You shall be more beloving than beloved .
The "why" is plain as way to parish church : He that a fool doth very wisely hit Doth very foolishly , although he smart , Not to seem senseless of the bob .
At your kind'st leisure .
If your master Would have a queen his beggar , you must tell him , That majesty , to keep decorum , must No less beg than a kingdom .
It is a business of some heat .
Sir , sir , that can not be .
No more of that .
What company is this ?
How foolish do your fears seem now , Calphurnia !
And I trow this is his house .
I have a widow aunt , a dowager Of great revenue , and she hath no child .
You are as well provided of both as any prince in the world .
Have I in conquest stretched mine arm so far To be afraid to tell graybeards the truth ?
Ay , and he'll tame her .
When our actions do not , Our fears do make us traitors .
Shall we not ?
What , I , my lord ?
Let him appear that's come from Antony .
Your father was ever virtuous , and holy men at their death have good inspirations .
Fears and scruples shake us .
Tut , I have the best armor of the world .
If the Prince be too important , tell him there is measure in everything , and so dance out the answer .
Is he not here ?
I long to know the truth hereof at large .
All men's faces are true , whatsome'er their hands are .
Why then , my cousin , Margaret , and Ursula Are much deceived , for they did swear you did .
Good meat , sir , is common ; that every churl affords .
Thou hast me , if thou hast me , at the worst , and thou shalt wear me , if thou wear me , better and better .
They are then excused , my lord , when they see not what they do .
Let th' Egyptians And the Phoenicians go a-ducking .
But you'll be secret ?
What means your grace ?
Mend" me , thou saucy fellow ?
Is this a holiday ?
Is that the chain you promised me today ?
Farewell , good Strato .
Pray thee , take pain To allay with some cold drops of modesty Thy skipping spirit , lest through thy wild behavior I be misconst'red in the place I go to , And lose my hopes .
As Caesar loved me , I weep for him .
There is no more to say ?
What doth she say , my lord of Buckingham ?
To me , sir ?
You have put him down , lady , you have put him down .
Remember our reward when the deed's done .
Let me not name it to you , you chaste stars , It is the cause .
I never sued to friend , nor enemy ; My tongue could never learn sweet smoothing word .
No , if without more words you will get you hence .
Good time of day unto my gracious lord .
Ay , good my lord .
How does Hamlet ?
Come on then .
Three proper young men of excellent growth and presence .
And he that will not follow Bourbon now , Let him go hence , and with his cap in hand Like a base pander hold the chamber door , Whilst by a slave , no gentler than my dog , His fairest daughter is contaminate .
Ay , my lord .
It is .
I hope your Majesty is pear me testimony and witness , and will avouchment that this is the glove of Alencon that your Majesty is give me , in your conscience now .
I dare be sworn for him he would not leave it Nor pluck it from his finger for the wealth That the world masters .
Honest , my lord ?
And now methinks I have a mind to it .
I will only be bold with Benedick for his company , for from the crown of his head to the sole of his foot he is all mirth .
If thou would have such a one , take me .
Are you acquainted with the difference That holds this present question in the court ?
I love you with so much of my heart that none is left to protest .
She is low-voiced .
The King will be gone from Southampton .
Know him ?
Merciful heaven !
Leonato , stand I here ?
But let us rear The higher our opinion , that our stirring Can from the lap of Egypt's widow pluck The ne'er lust-wearied Antony .
Speak .
The better that your Lordship please to ask .
Whither will you that I go To answer this your charge ?
Here comes the good Macduff .
All the East , Say thou , shall call her mistress." So he nodded , And soberly did mount an arm-gaunt steed , Who neighed so high that what I would have spoke Was beastly dumbed by him .
What private griefs they have , alas , I know not , That made them do it .
I can not tell .
Where should Othello go ? , Now , how dost thou look now ?
I'll sell all my land .
All-seeing heaven , what a world is this !
Bid him Report the feature of Octavia : her years , Her inclination .
These ears of mine , thou know'st did hear thee .
I thank you , sir .
As easy mayst thou the intrenchant air With thy keen sword impress as make me bleed .
Shall Kate be my wife ?
Would you buy her , that you enquire after her ?
O , what cause have I , Thine being but a moiety of my moan , To overgo thy woes and drown thy cries !
I prithee name the time , but let it not Exceed three days .
Are they good ?
Who , queasy with his insolence already , Will their good thoughts call from him .
Let go his arm .
Thou art Dromio , thou art my man , thou art thyself .
Had you been as wise as bold , Young in limbs , in judgment old , Your answer had not been inscrolled .
Hold you still .
Methinks it is like a weasel .
No .
By God's sonties , 'twill be a hard way to hit .
Were I a common laugher , or did use To stale with ordinary oaths my love To every new protester , if you know That I do fawn on men and hug them hard And , after , scandal them , or if you know That I profess myself in banqueting To all the rout , then hold me dangerous .
The things that threatened me Ne'er looked but on my back .
How came he mad ?
They are wise and honorable , And will , no doubt , with reasons answer you .
Ebbing men indeed Most often do so near the bottom run By their own fear or sloth .
I wish your Worship well .
In his tail .
If they suffer our departure , death's the word .
Farewell .
I will speak to this fellow. , Whose grave's this , sirrah ?
Go , rascals , go , and fetch my supper in .
And now I'll do 't .
Where's Seleucus ?
To his conveyance I assign my wife , With what else needful your good grace shall think To be sent after me .
First , if all obstacles were cut away And that my path were even to the crown As the ripe revenue and due of birth , Yet so much is my poverty of spirit , So mighty and so many my defects , That I would rather hide me from my greatness , Being a bark to brook no mighty sea , Than in my greatness covet to be hid And in the vapor of my glory smothered .

Strike not by land ; keep whole .
Thou stickest a dagger in me .
Would I were in an alehouse in London !
Lo , here's the chain .
Take thou the bill , give me thy mete- yard , and spare not me .
Most certain , sir .
I'll go farther off .
Sirs , I will practice on this drunken man .
Now Lord be thanked for my good amends !

Come .
At thy request , monster , I will do reason , any reason. , Come on , Trinculo , let us sing .
I have heard it over , And it is nothing , nothing in the world , Unless you can find sport in their intents , Extremely stretched and conned with cru 'l pain To do you service .
No , nor mine now .
Thou liest .
He goes forth gallantly .
Was 't not to this end That thou began'st to twist so fine a story ?
We are the makers of manners , Kate , and the liberty that follows our places stops the mouth of all find- faults , as I will do yours for upholding the nice fashion of your country in denying me a kiss .
I prithee , call him back .
None , my lord .
Is 't possible ?
Adultery ?
But , mistress , know yourself .
I remember .
I can see yet without spectacles , and I see no such matter .
This thou shalt answer .
Did Cicero say anything ?
Her name is Margery , indeed .

Sblood , but you'll not hear me !
Sure , 'tis not so .
Royal Egypt , Empress !
More shall they speak , for now I am bent to know , By the worst means , the worst .

A gentle riddance. , Draw the curtains , go. , Let all of his complexion choose me so .
Note if your lady strain his entertainment
We have , sir .
By th ' way we met My wife , her sister , and a rabble more Of vile confederates .
And sowing the kernels of it in the sea , bring forth more islands .
Lorenzo , and thy love .
Thou dost , and think'st it much to tread the ooze Of the salt deep , To run upon the sharp wind of the north , To do me business in the veins o ' th ' earth When it is baked with frost .
I can not blame her .
To horse , you gallant princes , straight to horse .
Yes , sir , but anger hath a privilege .
They must lie there .
Armed , brother ?
All with me's meet that I can fashion fit .
It were good that Benedick knew of it by some other , if she will not discover it .
With this , my lord , myself have naught to do .
How !
Here is a rural fellow That will not be denied your Highness' presence .
Dishonor not your mothers .
Is it for him you do envy me so ?
With all my heart , good youth .
But that I am forbid To tell the secrets of my prison house , I could a tale unfold whose lightest word Would harrow up thy soul , freeze thy young blood ,
Faith , I saw it not , but I felt it hot in her breath .
Well , peace be with you .
Give me that boy and I will go with thee .
And may , through all the world !
Who serv'st thou under ?
And I .
What if I had said I had seen him do you wrong ?
I give away myself for you and dote upon the exchange .
Fathered he is , and yet he's fatherless .
Where are these hearts ?
Here's snip and nip and cut and slish and slash , Like to a censer in a barber's shop .
Mistress , your father prays you leave your books And help to dress your sister's chamber up .
Signior Gremio , came you from the church ?
You know that I held Epicurus strong And his opinion .
I have a reasonable good ear in music .
And yet she'll kneel and pray , I have seen her do 't .
Well , I am sorry for your niece .
Petruchio , patience .
By Isis , I will give thee bloody teeth If thou with Caesar paragon again My man of men .
Gentlemen all , I do suspect this trash To be a party in this injury. , Patience awhile , good Cassio. , Come , come , Lend me a light .

But for the bloody napkin ?
Lord Edmund spake not with your lord at home ?
There are more things in heaven and earth , Horatio , Than are dreamt of in your philosophy .
The weakest kind of fruit Drops earliest to the ground , and so let me .
I will , my Hermia .
The meantime , lady , I'll raise the preparation of a war Shall stain your brother .
Do thy worst .
O limed soul that , struggling to be free , Art more engaged !
I have heard it said so .
They say Edgar , his banished son , is with the Earl of Kent in Germany .
For who would bear the whips and scorns of time , Th ' oppressor's wrong , the proud man's contumely , The pangs of despised love , the law's delay , The insolence of office , and the spurns That patient merit of th ' unworthy takes , When he himself might his quietus make With a bare bodkin ?
He begins at curfew and walks till the first cock .
Kent banished thus ?
I pray you .
Your overkindness doth wring tears from me .
Very vilely in the morning , when he is sober , and most vilely in the afternoon , when he is drunk .
Give order to my servants that they take No note at all of our being absent hence. , Nor you , Lorenzo. , Jessica , nor you .
Would you not swear , All you that see her , that she were a maid By these exterior shows ?
Be certain , nothing truer .
Then shall we be news-crammed .
Here , my lord .
I wish you well , and so I take my leave .
Twas you we laughed at .
Nay , I'll help too .
But come , my lord , let's away .
A pox o ' your bottle !
Bloody , bawdy villain !
Followed the old man forth .
That she may long live here , God say amen .
There is a kind of merry war betwixt Signor Benedick and her .
Come , for the third , Laertes .
Send out more horses .
No , no .
What should I answer you ?
Four nights will quickly dream away the time .
Stirred up by Dorset , Buckingham , and Morton , He makes for England , here to claim the crown .
Tis now but four o'clock .
None but friends .
No wonder , my lord .
So said , so done , is well .
Room !
I'll not deny him anything I have , No , not my body , nor my husband's bed .
Tis gone .
Call in the messengers .
I will bestow a breakfast to make you friends ; and we'll be all three sworn brothers to France .
Be witness to me , O thou blessed moon , When men revolted shall upon record Bear hateful memory , poor Enobarbus did Before thy face repent .
This is the very false gallop of verses .
The duke is humorous .
mutinies , in countries discord , in palaces treason , and the bond cracked 'twixt son and father .
How looked he ?
The basest horn of his hoof is more musical than the pipe of Hermes .
Seven days and nights ?
Why , how now , Stephano ?
For besides these beneficial news , it is the celebration of his nuptial .
Why prat'st thou to thyself and answer'st not ?
Come , father , I'll bestow you with a friend .
Ay , Celia , we stayed her for your sake .
A turn or two I'll walk To still my beating mind .
You come to me and you say , "Shylock , we would have moneys." You say so ! , You , that did void your rheum upon my beard And foot me as you spurn a stranger cur Over your threshold !
My face I'll grime with filth , Blanket my loins , elf all my hair in knots , And with presented nakedness outface The winds and persecutions of the sky .
Good people , enter and lay hold on him .
Poor man !
I should sin To think but nobly of my grandmother .
I know not how to pray your patience , Yet I must speak .
Oh yes , I saw sweet beauty in her face Such as the daughter of Agenor had , That made great Jove to humble him to her hand When with his knees he kissed the Cretan strand .
What is 't thou canst demand ?
What , I will be jovial .
Seek to know no more .
How say you , lady ?
You have done well , That men must lay their murders on your neck .
Dost thou hear ?
Bemonster not thy feature .
Why , so didst thou .
Well , what worst ?
If I dream not , thou art Emilia .
She replied It should be better he became her guest , Which she entreated .
He hath left them you And to your heirs forever , common pleasures , To walk abroad and recreate yourselves .
I know not where he lodges , and for me to devise a lodging and say he lies here , or he lies there , were to lie in mine own throat .
I have yet Room for six scotches more .
How hath your lordship brooked imprisonment ?
That death's unnatural that kills for loving .
Not I , believe me .
The spirit torments me .
The old man and his people Can not be well bestowed .
But do not go with it .
Is he gone ?
Oh , ay , Curtis , ay , and therefore fire , fire .
Good your highness , patience .
O , teach me how you look and with what art You sway the motion of Demetrius ' heart .
Welcome to Cyprus .
Good Lord , how bright and goodly shines the moon !
O proper stuff !
I will not be long from you .
So many miseries have crazed my voice That my woe-wearied tongue is still and mute .
Do not learn of him , Emilia , though he be thy husband .
Therefore , out of my love to you , I came hither to acquaint you withal , that either you might stay him from his intendment or brook such disgrace well as he shall run into , in that it is a thing of his own search and altogether against my will .
I pray you , pass with your best violence .
Well , I will do it , though I take thee in the king's company .
His grace speaks cheerfully .
The residue of your fortune Go to my cave and tell me. , Good old man , Thou art right welcome as thy master is .
Soft !
Not I , believe me .
There is more in it. , Cousin Ganymede .
Wherein , my friends , have I offended you ?
I'll follow it .
Fair daylight ?
And all the faith , the virtue of my heart , The object and the pleasure of mine eye , Is only Helena .
Legged like a man and his fins like arms !
If they will fight with us , bid them come down , Or void the field .
Madam , with all my heart .
It must be Nay , but hear you , Goodman Delver , Give me leave .
I will not .
O cruel !
Who's within ?
And is not the grease of a mutton as wholesome as the sweat of a man ?
If thou hast any sound or use of voice , Speak to me .
The business of the state does him offence , And he does chide with you .
But soft , but soft a while .
God be with my old master .
Thrice within this hour I saw him down , thrice up again and fighting .
At first And last , the hearty welcome .
My sickness grows upon me .
It was wont to hold me but while one tells twenty .
What , wilt thou flout me thus unto my face , Being forbid ?
Portia is dead .
Why , anything .
Nature in you stands on the very verge Of his confine .
Am I that name , Iago ?
But when we in our viciousness grow hard , Oh , misery on 't ! , the wise gods seel our eyes , In our own filth drop our clear judgments , make us Adore our errors , laugh at 's while we strut To our confusion .
Nothing but sit and sit , and eat and eat !
Therefore give out you are of Epidamnum , Lest that your goods too soon be confiscate .
Pish for thee , Iceland dog , Thou prick-eared cur of Iceland !
He seeks my life .
I do not understand .
Octavius , I have seen more days than you .
They have made him drink alms-drink .
And let him hold his fingers thus , and through that cranny shall Pyramus and Thisbe whisper .
Myself the man i ' th ' moon do seem to be , This is the greatest error of all the rest .
Lord , what though ?
What is the matter , husband ?
Or is he on his horse ?
If he be so resolved , I can o'ersway him .
God almighty , There is some soul of goodness in things evil , Would men observingly distill it out .
Let it be who it is .
What's he ?
Think'st thou that duty shall have dread to speak When power to flattery bows ?
Why , that is nothing .
I make not , but foresee .
There , take it , Prince .
Tell thou the tale !
Behold and see .
Yes , you have seen Cassio and she together .
My gracious sovereign , now in Devonshire , As I by friends am well advertised , Sir Edward Courtney and the haughty prelate , Bishop of Exeter , his elder brother , With many more confederates are in arms .
What is Thisbe ?
I know you by the waggling of your head .
I am an ass , indeed ; you may prove it by my long ears. , I have served him from the hour of my nativity to this instant , and have nothing at his hands for my service but blows .
How many fond fools serve mad jealousy !
With all my heart .
And let us swear our resolution .
May I with right and conscience make this claim ?
What from the cape can you discern at sea ?
Farewell , thou woeful welcomer of glory .
So I , being young , till now ripe not to reason .
Go fetch My best attires .
Could not a worm , an adder , do so much ?
I , thus neglecting worldly ends , all dedicated To closeness and the bettering of my mind With that which , but by being so retired , O'erprized all popular rate , in my false brother Awaked an evil nature .
Ay , in the catalogue ye go for men , As hounds and greyhounds , mongrels , spaniels , curs , Shoughs , water-rugs , and demi-wolves are clept All by the name of dogs .
Good signors both , when shall we laugh ?
And I another .
What's he That was not born of woman ?
I know you not .
Now , out of doubt Antipholus is mad ; Else would he never so demean himself .
My lord and lady , it is now our time , That have stood by and seen our wishes prosper , To cry , "Good joy , good joy , my lord and lady ! " My Lord Bassanio and my gentle lady , I wish you all the joy that you can wish , For I am sure you can wish none from me .
O , yes , my lord , but very idle words .
Now , if these men have defeated the law and outrun native punishment , though they can outstrip men , they have no wings to fly from God .
But by immortal providence , she's mine .
We shall , my liege .
Well , all's one for that .
Methinks you are too much of late i ' th ' frown .
Angels and ministers of grace defend us !
Well contented .
I would I were senseless , sir , that I might not feel your blows .
Oh , curse of marriage That we can call these delicate creatures ours And not their appetites !
Oh , farewell !
Look like th ' innocent flower , But be the serpent under 't .
How ?
Yet touch this sparingly , as 'twere far off , Because , my lord , you know my mother lives .
Yea , and text underneath : "Here dwells Benedick the married man" ?
Yet but three ?
O dainty duck !
He's safe for these three hours .
Alack , my lord , what do you mean by that ?
Never to speak of this that you have seen .
You have astonished him .
I had as lief be wooed of a snail .
Therefore I have entreated him along With us to watch the minutes of this night , That if again this apparition come He may approve our eyes and speak to it .
Let's follow .
This course I fittest choose , For forty ducats is too much to lose .
How now , how now ?
Show .
Methinks the ground is even .
Do you see this , O God ?
Come on , sir knave , have done your foolishness , And tell me how thou hast disposed thy charge .
This I'll report , dear lady .
Domestic fury and fierce civil strife Shall cumber all the parts of Italy .
Here the street is narrow .
Neither , my lord .
Would you had never seen him !
Why , he was met even now As mad as the vexed sea , singing aloud , Crowned with rank fumiter and furrow-weeds , With burdocks , hemlock , nettles , cuckoo-flowers , Darnel , and all the idle weeds that grow In our sustaining corn. , A century send forth .
How shall I answer you ?
Here , sir !
Touching our person , seek we no revenge , But we our kingdom's safety must so tender , Whose ruin you have sought , that to her laws We do deliver you .
Is it not past two o'clock ?
I have a good eye , uncle .
Good night .
Not I , I must be found .
If you call me Jephthah , my lord , I have a daughter that I love passing well .
Things at the worst will cease , or else climb upward To what they were before. , My pretty cousin , Blessing upon you .
Shake off this downy sleep , death's counterfeit , And look on death itself !
What news ?
I will bandy with thee in faction .
Go , make money .
Madam , I have a touch of your condition , Which can not brook the accent of reproof .
Done .
She hath prevented me .
Do you think I meant country matters ?
Hence , Lest that th ' infection of his fortune take Like hold on thee .
Prithee , Emilia , Go know of Cassio where he supped tonight. ,
Which is the lady I must seize upon ?
Cold friends to me .
Where is he ?
I pray thee , get us some excellent music , for tomorrow night we would have it at the Lady Hero's chamber window
We , at the height , are ready to decline .
A rarer spirit never Did steer humanity , but you gods will give us Some faults to make us men .
How shall we try it ?
So the spirit is eased .
Count , take of me my daughter , and with her my fortunes .
My master hath appointed me to go to Saint Luke's to bid the priest be ready to come against you come with your appendix .
What warlike noise is this ?
Hast stolen it from her ?
How heavy weighs my lord !
I hear him mock The luck of Caesar , which the gods give men To excuse their after wrath. , Husband , I come !
I think the sun where he was born Drew all such humors from him .
I pray thee , do not mock me , fellow student .
And when was he wont to wash his face ?
The name of Cassius honors this corruption , And chastisement doth therefore hide his head .
Be quiet , people .
She's a most triumphant lady , if report be square to her .
Truly , the more to blame he .
His wits are gone .
Yes , 'tis Emilia. , 'T is like she comes to speak of Cassio's death , The noise was high .
We shall know by this fellow .
Mend the instance , shepherd .
So please you , something touching the Lord Hamlet .
Look how he laughs already !
By Jove , I am not covetous for gold Nor care I who doth feed upon my cost ; It yearns me not if men my garments wear ; Such outward things dwell not in my desires .
I'll never see 't !
She's an excellent sweet lady , and , out of all suspicion , she is virtuous .
This accident is not unlike my dream , Belief of it oppresses me already .
And must she die for this ?

Silence that dreadful bell , it frights the isle From her propriety .
Now , good Metellus , go along by him .
Good sir , this ring was given me by my wife .
Either send the chain , or send me by some token .
Well .
Ready .
Noblest of men , woo't die ?
Fellow Grumio !
Is it a custom ?
It shall go hard if "Cambio" go without her .
How do you all at Verona ?
Go softly on .
Twelve year since , Miranda , twelve year since , Thy father was the Duke of Milan and A prince of power .
Hear me yet , good Shylock .
There was no link to color Peter's hat , And Walter's dagger was not come from sheathing .
Well , look unto it .
Who calls ?
By heaven , I'll make a ghost of him that lets me .
Set him before me .
Alack , what noise is this ?
Well , I will call Beatrice to you , who I think hath legs .
Fie on her !
Why then , can one desire too much of a good thing ? , Come , sister , you shall be the priest and marry us. , Give me your hand , Orlando. , What do you say , sister ?
I will run .
I can not drink too much of Brutus ' love .
I will none .
There's none but witches do inhabit here , And therefore 'tis high time that I were hence .
I did enact Julius Caesar .
I can not go to , man , nor 'tis not very well .
Now , my Lord Constable ?
O sir , content you .
For , look you , how cheerfully my mother looks , and my father died within these two hours .
These babes for Clarence weep and so do I ; I for an Edward weep ; so do not they .
Why "with some little train , " my Lord of Buckingham ?
Why ?
What's the boy Malcolm ?
Truly , she makes a very good report o' th' worm .
I think so too .
Nor is he dead , for aught that I can tell .
But I pray you , tell me , is my boy , God rest his soul , alive or dead ?
Find out moonshine , find out moonshine !
Have patience , sir .
All my reports go with the modest truth , Nor more , nor clipped , but so .
Good morrow , Benedick .
I will desire you to live in the meantime and eat your victuals .
Call my sister so .
No more perchance does mine , nor his , nor hers .
Tear him , tear him !
I'll not fight with thee .
Why , this it is when men are ruled by women .
Give me my robe .
Therefore I say with noble Buckingham That it is meet so few should fetch the prince .
Ay , and said nothing but what I protest intendment of doing .
In himself he is .
What , what , good cheer !
If 'twere no other , 'T is but so , I warrant .
I think our father will hence tonight .
I pray you stand good father to me now .
If I let him go , The debt he owes will be required of me .
Well , let him go .
Why comest thou ?
Peace !
What's done is done .
Come , cousin , I am sure you love the gentleman .
Faith , niece , you tax Signor Benedick too much , but he'll be meet with you , I doubt it not .
I knew what you would prove .
In this , though I can not be said to be a flattering honest man , it must not be denied but I am a plain-dealing villain .
Is not your lord honorable without marriage ?
Romans , countrymen , and lovers !
Burn but his books .
Thou shalt , I warrant thee .
Touched you the bastardy of Edward's children ?
He's not thy kinsman .
I rather choose To wrong the dead , to wrong myself and you , Than I will wrong such honorable men .
In saying so , you shall but say the truth .
Is all the counsel that we two have shared , The sisters ' vows , the hours that we have spent When we have chid the hasty-footed time For parting us , oh , is it all forgot ?
Wouldst thou betray me ?
Tis his fashion .
Have I , my lord ?
When Biondello comes , he waits on thee , But I will charm him first to keep his tongue .
Tomorrow is the day .
Being done unknown , I should have found it afterwards well done , But must condemn it now .
It is the bright day that brings forth the adder And that craves wary walking .
Tis pity of him .
How if they will not ?
Fare you well , my liege .
Your face , my thane , is as a book where men May read strange matters .
That thou dost love my daughter from thy soul .
Bellario greets your grace .
The man i ' th ' moon !
Do you not remember , lady , in your father's time a Venetian , a scholar and a soldier , that came hither in company of the Marquess of Montferrat ?
Mistress , Wilt thou still talk ?
Not in the legions Of horrid hell can come a devil more damned In evils to top Macbeth .
Look what I have .
And so return to you , and nothing else ?
Good day to both of you .
But I , who never knew how to entreat , Nor never needed that I should entreat , Am starved for meat , giddy for lack of sleep , With oaths kept waking and with brawling fed .
Just , just ; and the men do sympathize with the mastiffs in robustious and rough coming on , leaving their wits with their wives .
Monster , come , put some lime upon your fingers , and away with the rest .
This morning are they fled away and gone , And in their steads do ravens , crows , and kites Fly o'er our heads and downward look on us As we were sickly prey .
Go hence with diligence .
Nay , and I will .
Hath your grace ne'er a brother like you ?
Dolabella , I shall remain your debtor .
He is descried .
Friar , it can not be .
What , is he angry ?
What a life is this That your poor friends must woo your company ?
I am content .
So do I his .
You are welcome .
You are welcome .
You shall have anything .
Why , I have eat none yet .
And so am I for no woman .
I pray you all , If you have hitherto concealed this sight , Let it be tenable in your silence still .
My dukedom to a beggarly denier , I do mistake my person all this while !
And in this habit Met I my father with his bleeding rings , Their precious stones new lost , became his guide , Led him , begged for him , saved him from despair .
Ah , let be , let be !
Oh , these men , these men !
If it be not to come , it will be now .
Why , my boy ?
The ox hath therefore stretched his yoke in vain , The ploughman lost his sweat , and the green corn Hath rotted ere his youth attained a beard .
Yet say I , he is in love .
I think Alexander the Great was born in Macedon .
Hush !
Why are you silent ?
Heaven truly knows that thou art false as hell .
Then by your side no bed room me deny .
No , pray thee .
I would I were as sure of a good dinner .
Good e'en , brother .
He did appoint so .
And in good time here comes the sweating lord .
Duke Frederick , hearing how that every day Men of great worth resorted to this forest , Addressed a mighty power , which were on foot In his own conduct , purposely to take His brother here and put him to the sword .
Thou hast done a deed , I care not for thy sword , I'll make thee known
I must fetch his necessaries ashore .
The selfsame name , but one of better nature .
Mine and my father's death come not upon thee , Nor thine on me .
My Lord of Gloucester , I have too long borne Your blunt upbraidings and your bitter scoffs .
I know when one is dead and when one lives .
For me , with sorrow I embrace my fortune .
Ay , what of that ?
But to my mind , though I am native here And to the manner born , it is a custom More honored in the breach than the observance .
Tis done by me , and ends in "Margaret." Thus have you breathed your curse against yourself .
Fare you well .
I'll have no bigger .
Lie not a night from home .
Base Trojan , thou shalt die .
She should have died hereafter .
He has deserved it , were it carbuncled Like holy Phoebus' car .
I never spake with her in all my life .
When time shall serve , let but the herald cry , And I'll appear again .
Belike for want of rain , which I could well Beteem them from the tempest of my eyes .
Away with us to Athens .
Nor have I seen More that I may call men than you , good friend , And my dear father .
We must to the watch .
It is my duty , sir .
Well too .
His affections do not that way tend .
This , Casca .
She'll close and be herself whilst our poor malice Remains in danger of her former tooth .
Now , infidel , I have you on the hip .
Very good , my lord .
Offended us you have not , but the king .
Even so .
Then I , and you , and all of us fell down , Whilst bloody treason flourished over us .
Macbeth ! , Had I three ears , I'd hear thee .
What , sir , not yet at rest ?
There thou speak'st reason .
Then , world , thou hast a pair of chaps , no more , And throw between them all the food thou hast , They'll grind the one the other .
No .
Dismiss me ?
Come , boy .
And I pray thee now tell me , for which of my bad parts didst thou first fall in love with me ?
I am for thee straight .

Mark Antony In Egypt sits at dinner , and will make No wars without doors .
Now is the winter of our discontent Made glorious summer by this son of York , And all the clouds that loured upon our house In the deep bosom of the ocean buried .
He knows me as the blind man knows the cuckoo , By the bad voice .
What dost thou say ?
Come on , assay .
See where he looks out of the window .
But yet do I believe The origin and commencement of his grief Sprung from neglected love. , How now , Ophelia ?
And till the tears that she hath shed for thee Like envious floods o'errun her lovely face , She was the fairest creature in the world , And yet she is inferior to none .
It is his .
Are yet two Romans living such as these ?
The motion's good indeed and be it so. , Petruchio , I shall be your
Nay , come again , Good Kate .
Two o'clock is your hour ?
Farewell .
Sir , know you this glove ?
You , you , ay , you !
An you lie , sirrah , we'll have you whipped .
Thither I must , although against my will , For servants must their masters ' minds fulfill .
Threescore and ten I can remember well , Within the volume of which time I have seen Hours dreadful and things strange , but this sore night Hath trifled former knowings .
I will not be sworn but love may transform me to an oyster , but I'll take my oath on it , till he have made an oyster of me , he shall never make me such a fool .
Go , you wild bedfellow , you can not soothsay .
I never thought him worse .
Old fashions please me best .
God has given you one face and you make yourselves another .
I love you the better ; the hearers may cry "Amen." God match me with a good dancer !
Oh , stay but till then !
Of one whose hand , Like the base Indian , threw a pearl away Richer than all his tribe .
O monstrous , monstrous !
Come , your answer in broken music , for thy voice is music and thy English broken .
Where we lay , Our chimneys were blown down and , as they say , Lamentings heard i ' th ' air , strange screams of death , And prophesying with accents terrible Of dire combustion and confused events New hatched to the woeful time .
All , all .
Go in , Nerissa .
You always end with a jade's trick .
She is a virtuous and a reverend lady .
In pity of the challenger's youth , I would fain dissuade him , but he will not be entreated .
When Caesar says , "do this , " it is performed .
I see this hath a little dashed your spirits .
You jig and amble , and you lisp , you nickname God's creatures and make your wantonness your ignorance .
Thither he Will come to know his destiny .
Portia , what mean you ?
That is done , sir .
I will piece out the comfort with what addition I can .
No disgrace Shall fall you for refusing him at sea , Being prepared for land .
It shall be so .
Monsieur the challenger , the Princess calls for you .
What sayest thou ?
For Antony , I have no ears to his request .
He , sir .
O thou dull Moor !
This is the man .
And find I am alone felicitate In your dear highness ' love .
Hark !
The worst fault you have is to be in love .
And even now , but now , This house , these servants , and this same myself Are yours , my lord's .
Knock you here , sir ?
I have nothing to do with thee .
Wherefore do you come ?
Tut , tut , thou art all ice ; thy kindness freezes .
Make a short shrift .
Captain , I thee beseech to do me favors .
Thy husband knew it all .
I am afraid , methinks , to hear you tell it .
O villainy !
I have a pain upon my forehead , here .
Marry , sir , by a rule as plain as the plain bald pate of Father Time himself .
Our enemies have beat us to the pit .
Quiet thy cudgel .
All that I will tell you is that the duke hath dined .
I say amen to her .
Here is everything advantageous to life .
Repent but you that you shall lose your friend , And he repents not that he pays your debt .
What !
An oath of mickle might , and fury shall abate .
Having once this juice , I'll watch Titania when she is asleep And drop the liquor of it in her eyes .
From Silvius , sir .
The rest shall keep as they are .
Signior Baptista , will you be so strange ?
Tarry , sweet Beatrice .
For though she's as like this as a crab's like an apple , yet I can tell what I can tell .
Why , gentle sweet , you shall see no such thing .
I hope he be in love .
He did , my gracious lord , begin that place , Which , since , succeeding ages have re-edified .
I was always plain with you , and so now I speak my agitation of the matter .
Now , herald , are the dead numbered ?
As birds do , Mother .
Thy garments are not spotted with our blood , Nor thou within the compass of my curse .
My lord , I am for you , though it cost me ten nights ' watchings .
Do not torment me .
Give me your hand .
Come hither , captain .
Oh , rarely base !
Therefore , Go , clear thy crystals. , Yoke-fellows in arms , Let us to France , like horse-leeches , my boys , To suck , to suck , the very blood to suck .
Stay , gentle Helena .
You have my consent .
I'll ask them .
Men , wives , and children stare , cry out , and run As it were doomsday .
Adieu , adieu , adieu .
It gives me wonder great as my content To see you here before me .
Leave me , Iago .
To have no man come over me !
Her waspish-headed son has broke his arrows , Swears he will shoot no more , but play with sparrows And be a boy right out .
Alas , he faints !
Methought I heard a voice cry , "Sleep no more !
Suffer love !
I do entreat you , not a man depart , Save I alone , till Antony have spoke .
Portia , adieu .
All this" ?
Rather on Nilus' mud Lay me stark naked and let the waterflies Blow me into abhorring .
What is his strength by land ?
What , so brief ?
But I will wed thee in another key , With pomp , with triumph , and with reveling .
Thy asses are gone about 'em .
I am their father's mother .
What need one ?
What dost thou think ?
If this prove A vision of the Island , one dear son Shall I twice lose .
Caesar , all hail !
The business of this man looks out of him .
Therefore be o ' good cheer , for truly I think you are damned .
Call Claudio and some other of my men .
Will you go ?
I do not know what "poetical" is .
That's strange .
I hear a tongue , shriller than all the music , Cry "Caesar ! " , Speak .
No .
What's that ?
Have I not heard the sea , puffed up with winds , Rage like an angry boar chafed with sweat ?
They stared , and were distracted .
Here's our chief guest .
Not a drop before .
Our duty to your honor .
Now lies he there , And none so poor to do him reverence .
Lear's shadow .
Why then , good night indeed .
And never could maintain his part but in the force of his will .
Thus with imagined wing our swift scene flies In motion of no less celerity Than that of thought .
They'll tell all .
This is some priory .
I am tame , sir .
To her that is not here , nor doth not hear .
Makest thou this shame thy pastime ?
Why , this was molded on a porringer !
What follows , then , my lord ?
My life will be too short , And every measure fail me .
It is twice blessed : It blesseth him that gives and him that takes .
Why , look you how you storm !
I am glad he's come , howsoe'er he comes .
Will you go , sister ? , Shepherd , ply her hard .
Far off methinks I hear the beaten drum .
I was not born to die on Brutus ' sword .
Bleed , bleed , poor country !
Go seek the traitor Gloucester .
We may effect this business yet ere day .
I tell you , 'twill sound harshly in her ears .
Hid'st thou that forehead with a golden crown Where should be branded , if that right were right , The slaughter of the prince that owed that crown And the dire death of my poor sons and brothers ?
I must , she'll rail in the street else .
I'll not be strucken , my lord .
I never saw an action of such shame .
I must perforce Have shown to thee such a declining day , Or look on thine .
I am famished in his service .
And that is Claudio .
Well demanded , wench .
Yet marked I where the bolt of Cupid fell .
It shall be said his judgment ruled our hands .
Untimely comes this hurt .
Methinks I do .
I do remember me , Henry the Sixth Did prophesy that Richmond should be king , When Richmond was a little peevish boy .
I can suck melancholy out of a song as a weasel sucks eggs .
What beard were I best to play it in ?
We judge no less. , Uncle of Exeter , Enlarge the man committed yesterday That railed against our person .
Prithee , be cheerful .
I'll rather kill myself .
Does't not go well ?
She is of so free , so kind , so apt , so blessed a disposition , she holds it a vice in her goodness not to do more than she is requested .
We'll enter all together .
Show .
And unrespective boys .
Edmund and I have talked , And more convenient is he for my hand Than for your lady's .
I am not Barbason ; you can not conjure me .
What is thy name ?
Why looks your grace so heavily today ?
It is a high-wrought flood .
I pray you , speak not .
Mistress , you must come away to your father .
It did bass my trespass .
Our gracious brother , I will go with them .
But one word more , He will not be commanded .
Let not that doctor e'er come near my house !
Nay , then thou lov'st it not And all my pains is sorted to no proof .
And they have conspired together .
Yet would not so have been , Durst I have done my will .
Help , ho !
Then is courtesy a turncoat .
I'd have thee live , For in my sense 'tis happiness to die .
And Launcelot , soon at supper shalt thou see Lorenzo , who is thy new master's guest .
Tell me , heavenly bow , If Venus or her son , as thou dost know , Do now attend the queen ?
Rebellious dead , rise never till the wood Of Birnam rise , and our high-placed Macbeth Shall live the lease of nature , pay his breath To time and mortal custom .
If not , he's plain .
Look , here comes Helena .
My stomach is not constant .
It were an honest action to say So to the Moor .
Speak what we feel , not what we ought to say .
Lend me your hand .
I will praise any man that will praise me , though it can not be denied what I have done by land .
There is ten thousand , Geese , villain ?
Cross him in nothing .
This ring , good sir , alas , it is a trifle .
Coraggio , bully-monster , If these be true spies which I wear in my head , here's a goodly sight .
They say there's but five upon this isle .
Rest you happy !
Some say the Earth Was feverous and did shake .
Seyton ! , I am sick at heart , When I behold , Seyton , I say ! , This push Will cheer me ever , or disseat me now .
You may relish him more in the soldier than in the scholar .
I can not speak Any beginning to this peevish odds , And would in action glorious I had lost Those legs that brought me to a part of it .
And doth affection breed it ?
Ne'er may I look on day , nor sleep on night But she tells to your Highness simple truth .
On each side her Stood pretty dimpled boys , like smiling Cupids , With divers-colored fans , whose wind did seem To glow the delicate cheeks which they did cool , And what they undid did .
I would I were invisible , to catch the strong fellow by the leg .
Yes , that thou didst .
Go .
But sup them well and look unto them all .
Metellus Cimber ?
It was mine art , When I arrived and heard thee , that made gape The pine and let thee out .
Sweet Portia , If you did know to whom I gave the ring , If you did know for whom I gave the ring , And would conceive for what I gave the ring , And how unwillingly I left the ring When naught would be accepted but the ring , You would abate the strength of your displeasure .
Here are enemies .
What would you have ?
Therefore , as I am bound , Receive it from me .
Tell me , how fares our loving mother ?
But who comes here ?
How will you live ?
Sir , a whole history .
Good sooth , even thus .
Far more , far more , to you do I decline .
What then ?
Roderigo killed ?
Oh , what a goodly outside falsehood hath !
Of anything the image tell me that Hath kept with thy remembrance .
Nathaniel's coat , sir , was not fully made , And Gabriel's pumps were all unpinked i ' th ' heel .
I am no traitor .
Let me embrace with old Vincentio , And wander we to see thy honest son , Who will of thy arrival be full joyous .
Mistress , upon my life I tell you true .
Cassius from bondage will deliver Cassius .
Swear not by time to come , for that thou hast Misused ere used , by times ill-used o'erpast .
My liege , this was my glove ; here is the fellow of it .
We charge you , in the Prince's name , stand !
Temperance was a delicate wench .
Then weigh what loss your honor may sustain If with too credent ear you list his songs , Or lose your heart , or your chaste treasure open To his unmastered importunity .
Why came I hither but to that intent ?
What call you the carriages ?
Against my will I am sent to bid you come in to dinner." There's a double meaning in that .
And so am I , being else by faith enforced To call young Claudio to a reckoning for it .
I must needs tell thee all .
O Stephano , two Neapolitans 'scaped !
But I can tell you that of late this duke Hath ta'en displeasure 'gainst his gentle niece , Grounded upon no other argument But that the people praise her for her virtues And pity her for her good father's sake ; And , on my life , his malice 'gainst the lady Will suddenly break forth .
I have it not about me .
You , Pyramus ' father. , Myself , Thisbe's father. , Snug the joiner , you , the lion's part. , And I hope here is a play fitted .
But I am shepherd to another man And do not shear the fleeces that I graze .
What , thou speak'st drowsily ?
They that have done this deed are honorable .
I tell thee , Constable , my mistress wears his own hair .
Then he offered it to him again , then he put it by again , but , to my thinking , he was very loath to lay his fingers off it .
Michael Cassio , Lieutenant to the warlike Moor Othello , Is come on shore .
Give every man thy ear but few thy voice .
As if time were in debt .
Begone !
Why , this is an arrant counterfeit rascal .
Thou didst usurp my place , and dost thou not Usurp the just proportion of my sorrow ?
By this marriage , All little jealousies , which now seem great , And all great fears , which now import their dangers , Would then be nothing .
Why , I will see thee at Philippi , then .
The poison of that lies in you to temper .
Not so , neither .
To vail the title , as her mother doth .
Some there be that shadows kiss .
This is thy office .
Those that do die of it do seldom or never recover .
Do not , Phoebe .
How have I been behaved that he might stick The small'st opinion on my least misuse ?
Round , even to faultiness .
We can not all be masters , nor all masters Can not be truly followed .
We know what belongs to a watch .
The king himself is rode to view their battle .
I shall , my lord .
I have led you oft ; carry me now , good friends , And have my thanks for all .
By 'r lady , I think it be so .
These are portents , but yet I hope , I hope They do not point on me .
One stroke Shall free thee from the tribute which thou payest .
And the business you have broached here can not be without you , especially that of Cleopatra's , which wholly depends on your abode .
She is stirring , sir .
Abhorred villain !
Then 'tis like the breath of an unfee'd lawyer .
I'll follow thee and make a heaven of hell , To die upon the hand I love so well .
I am a tainted wether of the flock , Meetest for death .
No , sir .
Let me see .
Come .
Madam , O good Empress !
Yea , yea , my lord .

This fellow's of exceeding honesty And knows all quantities , with a learned spirit , Of human dealings .
Here comes Thisbe .
But what though ?
I pray you tell Benedick of it and hear what he will say .
They were villains , murderers .
Tweaks me by the nose ?
But where the greater malady is fixed The lesser is scarce felt .
But though they jump not on a just account , As in these cases , where the aim reports 'T is oft with difference , yet do they all confirm A Turkish fleet , and bearing up to Cyprus .
So may you lose your arms .
For Hamlet and the trifling of his favor , Hold it a fashion and a toy in blood , A violet in the youth of primy nature , Forward , not permanent , sweet , not lasting , The perfume and suppliance of a minute .
This way , my lord .
Go after her .
As young as I am , I have observed these three swashers .
Oh , this false soul of Egypt !
Be ruled .
Pause awhile , And let my counsel sway you in this case .
No .
Well , go thy way .
I must leave them and seek some better service .
What say you , uncle ?
Now forth , Lord Constable and princes all , And quickly bring us word of England's fall .
Farewell .
Fourscore ducats at a sitting !
You have obtained it .
I will be treble-sinewed , -hearted , -breathed , And fight maliciously .
What will you do with 't , that you have been so earnest To have me filch it ?
For your life you durst not .
Oh , I could weep My spirit from mine eyes .
Here , here , sir !
Will you sup with me tonight , Casca ?
Alas the day !
Or Charles or something weaker masters thee .
First , I ask thee what they have done ; thirdly , I ask thee what's their offense ; sixth and lastly , why they are committed ; and , to conclude , what you lay to their charge .
Mock not , Enobarbus .
What are you ?
Disdain and scorn ride sparkling in her eyes , Misprizing what they look on , and her wit Values itself so highly that to her All matter else seems weak .
I prithee speak to me as to thy thinkings , As thou dost ruminate , and give thy worst of thoughts The worst of words .
Come , I will have thee , but , by this light , I take thee for pity .
All my pretty ones ?
By th ' law of arms thou wast not bound to answer An unknown opposite .
A soothsayer bids you beware the ides of March .
Where is she ?
I'll make a sop o ' th ' moonshine of you .
I shall entreat him To answer like himself .
How now , Fluellen , cam'st thou from the bridge ?
He says his name's Poor Tom .
So you walk softly , and look sweetly , and say nothing , I am yours for the walk , and especially when I walk away .
I have no power upon you .
Only I yield to die .

If more , the more thou'st wronged me .
No more that thane of Cawdor shall deceive Our bosom interest : go pronounce his present death , And with his former title greet Macbeth .
Oh , but I fear .
My lord , what is your will ?
This will prove a brave kingdom to me , where I shall have my music for nothing .
Since that respects and fortunes are his love , I shall not be his wife .
Welcome hither .
What is it ?
He's that he is .
It is very hot .
Here comes newer comfort .

My brother never Did urge me in his act .
Let husbands know Their wives have sense like them .
Ha , ha !
What impossible matter will he make easy next ?
Will you withdraw ?
Good now , some excellent fortune !
Or rather , do I not in plainest truth Tell you I do not , nor I can not , love you ?
Hail , brave friend !
By my troth , niece , thou wilt never get thee a husband if thou be so shrewd of thy tongue .
You have among you many a purchased slave , Which , like your asses and your dogs and mules , You use in abject and in slavish parts Because you bought them .
Or would you have me speak after my custom , as being a professed tyrant to their sex ?
Anon , as patient as the female dove When that her golden couplets are disclosed , His silence will sit drooping .

Did you and he consent in Cassio's death ?
Could I repair what she will wear in me As I can change these poor accoutrements , 'Twere well for Kate and better for myself .
Would you , the supervisor , grossly gape on , Behold her topped ?
Found you no displeasure in him by word or countenance ?
Madam , what should I do ?
Which of you , if you were a prince's son Being pent from liberty , as I am now , If two such murderers as yourselves came to you , Would not entreat for life ?
Under the earth .
But for your private satisfaction , Because I love you , I will let you know .
Throw my heart Against the flint and hardness of my fault , Which , being dried with grief , will break to powder And finish all foul thoughts .
Ay , more .
I pray now , keep below .
My hearty friends , You take me in too dolorous a sense , For I spake to you for your comfort , did desire you To burn this night with torches .
Your cake there is warm within ; you stand here in the cold .
Give me audience , good madam .
But shall we wear these glories for a day , Or shall they last and we rejoice in them ?
Sometime I'd divide , And burn in many places .
Do you love me ?
There sleeps Titania sometime of the night , Lulled in these flowers with dances and delight .
I remember .
I'll catch it ere it come to ground .
Besides , in mercy , The constable desires thee thou wilt mind Thy followers of repentance , that their souls May make a peaceful and a sweet retire From off these fields where , wretches , their poor bodies Must lie and fester .
Let us withdraw .
No , he's in Tartar limbo , worse than hell .
Tis a good silling , I warrant you , or I will change it .
But you'll lie like dogs , and yet say nothing neither .
Marry , do I , sir , and I came to acquaint you with a matter .
O you sir , you , come you hither , sir .
If you outstay the time , upon mine honor And in the greatness of my word , you die .
I durst not !
Good morrow , old Sir Thomas Erpingham .
God witness with me , I have wept for thine .
How say you , then ?
I'll see no more .
It is a fault that springeth from your eye .
I thank you for your pains and courtesy .
Whate'er becomes of me , This is a soldier's kiss .
What is it ye would see ?
Caesar and Lepidus Are in the field .
Who hath he left behind him general ?
In troth , I think I should , and undo 't when I had done .
This is not the way To win your daughter .
My industrious servant , Ariel !
The food that to him now is as luscious as locusts shall be to him shortly as bitter as coloquintida .
A very forward March-chick !
Then is there mirth in heaven When earthly things , made even , Atone together .
Well , as you guess ?
It is no boast , being asked , to say we are .
What is your tidings ?
Why , who would not make her husband a cuckold to make him a monarch ?
Cheer your heart .
Thou wast provoked by thy bloody mind , That never dream'st on aught but butcheries .
Our tongue is rough , coz , and my condition is not smooth , so that , having neither the voice nor the heart of flattery about me , I can not so conjure up the spirit of love in her that he will appear in his true likeness .
Who chooseth me must give and hazard all he hath." You shall look fairer ere I give or hazard .
I had it of him .
The greater part , the horse in general , Are come with Cassius .
After my death , the one half of my lands , And , in possession , twenty thousand crowns .
My father dead , my fortune lives for me .
I had rather have a handful or two of dried peas .
What , To kiss in private ?
Bid that welcome Which comes to punish us , and we punish it , Seeming to bear it lightly .
Eros , Wouldst thou be windowed in great Rome and see Thy master thus with pleached arms , bending down His corrigible neck , his face subdued To penetrative shame , whilst the wheeled seat Of fortunate Caesar , drawn before him , branded His baseness that ensued ?

Light is an effect of fire , and fire will burn : ergo , light wenches will burn .
Say what you will , sir , but I know what I know .
But do not stain The even virtue of our enterprise , Nor th ' insuppressive mettle of our spirits , To think that or our cause or our performance Did need an oath , when every drop of blood That every Roman bears , and nobly bears , Is guilty of a several bastardy If he do break the smallest particle Of any promise that hath passed from him .
What need you five and twenty , ten , or five To follow in a house where twice so many Have a command to tend you ?
I will tell you why .
We have been praying for our husbands ' welfare , Which speed , we hope , the better for our words .
I am glad to see you mad .
In faith , my lord , not I .
Come , come and take a queen Worth many babes and beggars !
Why , i ' faith , methinks she's too low for a high praise , too brown for a fair praise , and too little for a great praise .
Come , sit down , every mother's son , and rehearse your parts. , Pyramus , you begin .
I am your neighbor , and was suitor first .

He is my dear friend , an please you .
He has no more directions in the true disciplines of the wars , look you , of the Roman disciplines , than is a puppy dog .
Next month with us .
Go , sirrah , seek him .
My friend , thy husband , honest , honest Iago .
If I can fasten but one cup upon him , With that which he hath drunk tonight already , He'll be as full of quarrel and offense As my young mistress ' dog .
Ask her forgiveness ?
It is "never tire." Oh .
And I the king shall love thee .
Think of it .
Why , for that too .
Good my lord , vouchsafe me a word with you .
Your betters have endured me say my mind , And if you can not , best you stop your ears .
Get thee to a nunnery .
Money by me !
And for my sister and her princely sons , Be satisfied , dear God , with our true blood , Which , as thou know'st , unjustly must be spilt .

I do beseech your lordship , call her back .
I know you are my eldest brother , and in the gentle condition of blood you should so know me .

You appeared to me but as a common man .
Sister , it is not a little I have to say of what most nearly appertains to us both .

I know she is an irksome brawling scold .
Will not the mayor then and his brethren come ?
Thus do they , sir : they take the flow o' th' Nile By certain scales i' th' Pyramid .
To cabin , silence !
To punish me for what you make me do Seems much unequal .
Let witchcraft join with beauty , lust with both .
Amen .
Signior , is all your family within ?
Idle old man That still would manage those authorities That he hath given away !
Indeed , sweet love , I was coming to your house .
Bid them achieve me and then sell my bones .
Go then , find me a meet hour to draw Don Pedro and the Count Claudio alone .
All the world's a stage , And all the men and women merely players .
I want more uncles here to welcome me .
Some light-foot friend post to the duke of Norfolk , Ratcliffe , thyself , or Catesby .
So the gods keep you And make the hearts of Romans serve your ends .
In happy time .
And be not jealous on me , gentle Brutus .
Think , when we talk of horses , that you see them Printing their proud hoofs i ' th ' receiving earth , For 'tis your thoughts that now must deck our kings , Carry them here and there , jumping o'er times ,
Why , see you not ?
Fare you well .
There's a time for all things .
How ?
Even when you please , since you will have it so .

But what is your affair in Elsinore ?
The clerk is answered .
Where is my lord the duke of Gloucester ?
Sooth , la , I'll help .
Now , if you are a maid , answer to this .
Lend me a looking-glass .
The spirit of my father grows strong in me , and I will no longer endure it .
Come , let us to the castle .
List his discourse of war , and you shall hear A fearful battle rendered you in music .
The foul fiend haunts Poor Tom in the voice of a nightingale .

Tongue nor heart can not conceive nor name thee !
She is herself a dowry .
Thanks , Rosencrantz and gentle Guildenstern .
Oh , I die for food .
I will not long be troubled with you .
Why , she would hang on him As if increase of appetite had grown By what it fed on , and yet , within a month , Let me not think on 't .
Her worth being mounted on the wind , Through all the world bears Rosalind .
You charge me most unjustly .
I say a devil .
Thereby shall we shadow The numbers of our host and make discovery Err in report of us .
Come ho , and wake Diana with a hymn !
You would all this time have proved there is no time for all things .
That now Sweno , the Norways ' king , craves composition .

No cock of mine .
If we walk not in the trodden paths our very petticoats will catch them .
I will bestow you where you shall have time To speak your bosom freely .
Let him fly far .
How now , lady ?
Be these the wretches that we played at dice for ?
Mass , and my elbow itched , I thought there would a scab follow .
Edmund , farewell .
My master is grown quarrelsome .
To whom , my lord ?
Truly , the lady fathers herself. , Be happy , lady , for you are like an honorable father .
Think on thy sins .
How now ?
Thy voice is thunder , but thy looks are humble .
What art thou , fellow ?
Art thou wise ?
O wise and upright judge !
The king's son , Ferdinand , With hair up-staring , then , like reeds , not hair , Was the first man that leaped , cried , "Hell is empty And all the devils are here." Why , that's my spirit !
There's magic in the web of it .
Give me your hand .
Tis dangerous to be spoken .
Gentlemen , you are welcome to Elsinore .
In brief , Sorrow would be a rarity most beloved If all could so become it .
And so farewell , Signior Lucentio .
Ay , marry , is 't .
In happy time here comes the duke himself .
Was he not companion with the riotous knights That tend upon my father ?
Meantime God grants that we have need of you .
Had you rather Caesar were living and die all slaves , than that Caesar were dead , to live all free men ?
Keep thy word .
Good morrow , Lieutenant Bardolph .
God save the king .
No , Caesar hath it not .
Away , go !
The west yet glimmers with some streaks of day .
You laugh when boys or women tell their dreams .
But , in good sooth , are you he that hangs the verses on the trees wherein Rosalind is so admired ?
You have no stomach , Signior .
I know no answer .
God give us leisure for these rites of love !
O sir , to wilful men , The injuries that they themselves procure Must be their schoolmasters .
Are all thy conquests , glories , triumphs , spoils , Shrunk to this little measure ?
Why so , being gone , Why so , being gone , I am a man again .
Sir , in good faith , or in sincere verity , Under th ' allowance of your great aspect , Whose influence , like the wreath of radiant fire On flickering Phoebus ' front , What mean'st by this ?
You are a spirit , I know .
It is a man's office , but not yours .
And all my children ?
Didst perceive ?
Methought their souls whose bodies Richard murdered Came to my tent and cried on victory .
Tis very true .
That you must teach me .
But I will tarry .
Commend me to my kind lord .
But I do see you're moved .
I once did lend my body for his wealth , Which but for him that had your husband's ring Had quite miscarried .
Dear my lord , if you in your own proof Have vanquished the resistance of her youth And made defeat of her virginity , I know what you would say : if I have known her , You will say she did embrace me as a husband , And so extenuate the forehand sin .
And from hence I go To make these doubts all even .
Tis but a little way that I can bring you , For I attend here .
If every of your wishes had a womb , And fertile every wish , a million .
But you shall find the band that seems to tie their friendship together will be the very strangler of their amity .
Away , old man .
His majesty , Tend'ring my person's safety , hath appointed This conduct to convey me to the Tower .
If they'll do neither , we will come to them And make them skirr away as swift as stones Enforced from the old Assyrian slings .
But to Orlando : did he leave him there , Food to the sucked and hungry lioness ?
My good friends , hark !
Her length of sickness , with what else more serious Importeth thee to know , this bears .
I will kiss your hand , and so I leave you .
Your mistress sent to have me home to dinner ?
Hence !
Oh , thou art wise !
No , by no means .
Bid them all fly .
Oh , wretched villain !
Ha , what sayest thou ?
Shall I say to Caesar What you require of him ?
So could I , faith , boy , to have the next wish after , That Lucentio indeed had Baptista's youngest daughter .
I will talk further with you .
Tis a subject for a sovereign to reason on , and for a sovereign's sovereign to ride on , and for the world , familiar to us and unknown , to lay apart their particular functions and wonder at him .
And so , my lord , adieu .
He bears The third part of the world , man .
When he is best he is a little worse than a man , and when he is worst he is little better than a beast .
The queen carouses to thy fortune , Hamlet .
I marvel what kin thou and thy daughters are .
Tis certain so , the Prince woos for himself .
I'll torture him .
Denmark's a prison .
Nor no one here , for curses never pass The lips of those that breathe them in the air .
What should such fellows as I do crawling between earth and heaven ?
All lost !
Till night , my lord , and all night too .
Not know me yet ?
Tush , I may as well say the fool's the fool .
Crowns in my purse I have and goods at home , And so am come abroad to see the world .
What do you here ?
Well , sir , I'll bring you to our master Lear And leave you to attend him .
No ?
For , you know , Pyramus and Thisbe meet by moonlight .
Go to the gate .
Thou canst tell why one's nose stands i ' th ' middle on 's face ?
I should have known no less .
Every hour He flashes into one gross crime or other That sets us all at odds .
Nay , come , I pray you , sir , give me the chain .
Where shall we meet i ' th ' morning ?
With him is Gratiano gone along .
Come , some music !
I am sorry I beat thee .
I have a mind to strike thee ere thou speak'st .
Say to the king the knowledge of the broil As thou didst leave it .
Are you now going to dispatch this thing ?
Thy daemon , that thy spirit which keeps thee , is Noble , courageous , high , unmatchable Where Caesar's is not .
I had forgot , three months .
When it is lighted , come and call me here .
Read the will !
Well , madam , and in health .
I must go in .
Thou hast mettle enough in thee to kill care .
Come hither , Proculeius .
I wish , forbear .
Thy name is Gloucester .
Welcome , my friends all .
O thou invisible spirit of wine , if thou hast no name to be known by , let us call thee devil !
That with this little arm and this good sword I have made my way through more impediments Than twenty times your stop .
Ay. , Fare you well , fair gentleman .
Heaven me such uses send , Not to pick bad from bad , but by bad mend !
I know thee well , a serviceable villain , As duteous to the vices of thy mistress As badness would desire .
Mine , and most of our fortunes tonight , shall be , drunk to bed .
Even now , now , very now , an old black ram Is tupping your white ewe .
So when he opens his purse to give us our reward , thy conscience flies out .
Is thy master stirring ?
I had rather be a peddler .
O Cassio , Cassio , Cassio !
We will , fair queen , up to the mountain's top , And mark the musical confusion Of hounds and echo in conjunction .
Then to the wood will he tomorrow night Pursue her .
Myself myself confound , Heaven and fortune bar me happy hours , Day , yield me not thy light , nor night thy rest , Be opposite all planets of good luck To my proceedings if , with dear heart's love , Immaculate devotion , holy thoughts , I tender not thy beauteous princely daughter .
My dearest coz , I pray you school yourself .
For my part , I care not .
Then both , or one , or anything thou wilt .
Ratcliffe , come hither .
Then follow me and give me audience , friends .
Unless I have mista'en his colors much , Which well I am assured I have not done , His regiment lies half a mile , at least , South from the mighty power of the king .
Would you were not sick !
Thou thinkest I am in sport .
Adieu , Till your return at night .
Praised be God , and not our strength , for it !
I must and will have Katherine to my wife .
I fear you have sold your own lands to see other men's .
Why ask you ?
I will survey th ' inscriptions back again .
And therefore 'tis called a sensible tale .
Indeed , he hath an excellent good name .
Laugh to scorn The power of man , for none of woman born Shall harm Macbeth .
Trinculo , run into no further danger .
What woman's man ?
Are you native of this place ?
Alack , I love myself .
Come , come , dispatch .
Signior Baptista , my business asketh haste , And every day I can not come to woo .
Thou art a cobbler , art thou ?
So every bondman in his own hand bears The power to cancel his captivity .
Wipe thine eyes .
Rosalind lacks then the love Which teacheth thee that thou and I am one .
I should venture purgatory for 't .
And supportable To make the dear loss have I means much weaker Than you may call to comfort you , for I Have lost my daughter .
That I love her , I feel .
What's thy pleasure ?
Riotous madness , To be entangled with those mouth-made vows Which break themselves in swearing !
Help to bear this away where my hogshead of wine is , or I'll turn you out of my kingdom .
Twenty crowns ?
What is the matter , lady ?
Take you some company , and away to horse .
Was this before the king returned ?
I am old now , And these same crosses spoil me .
Sit , sir .
Say that they slack their duties
Howe'er thou art a fiend , A woman's shape doth shield thee .
I put it in the pocket of my gown .
What , a prisoner ?
Not yet." The hour's now come .
What , is my beaver easier than it was ?
He prays you to save his life .
Good love , call him back .
Who would be jealous , then , of such a one ?
Thou hadst , and more , Miranda .
In his own grace he doth exalt himself More than in your addition .
Edward Plantagenet , why art thou dead ?
Of the king's ship , The mariners , say how thou hast disposed , And all the rest o ' th ' fleet .
Art thou the slave that with thy breath hast killed Mine innocent child ?
She's but the sign and semblance of her honor .
Despair and die !
If wolves had at thy gate howled that stern time , Thou shouldst have said , "Good porter , turn the key , " All cruels else subscribed .
We never valued this poor seat of England And therefore , living hence , did give ourself To barbarous license , as 'tis ever common That men are merriest when they are from home .
We must both give and take , my loving lord .
I am sorry to find you thus .
What will you do ?
Look upon Caesar .
No wonder , sir , But certainly a maid .
I have seen you both .
Have mercy , Jesu ! , Soft , I did but dream .
I will be faithful .
My master stays in the street .
When last I was at Exeter , The mayor in courtesy showed me the castle And called it Rougemont , at which name I started , Because a bard of Ireland told me once I should not live long after I saw Richmond .
Therefore great France My mourning and importuned tears hath pitied .
I would your duty were as foolish too .
These time ambles withal .
Fine , i ' faith !
The several messengers From hence attend dispatch .
Oh , that you bore The mind that I do , what a sleep were this For your advancement !
Then but forbear your food a little while Whiles , like a doe , I go to find my fawn And give it food .
I'll claim that promise at your Grace's hands .
Hast thou affections ?
The gown is made Just as my master had direction .
Not so sick , my lord , As she is troubled with thick-coming fancies That keep her from her rest .
We were Christians eno ' before , e'en as many as could well live one by another .
Would you praise Caesar , say "Caesar." Go no further .
By my troth , 's not so good , and I warrant your cousin will say so .
Do .
Dost thou in conscience think , tell me , Emilia , That there be women do abuse their husbands In such gross kind ?
Let not my worser spirit tempt me again To die before you please .
The sight whereof I think you had from me , From Claudio and the Prince .
Lady !
While he was yet in Rome His power went out in such distractions as Beguiled all spies .
I will have it all mine .
Brief let me be .
But we are spirits of another sort .
Is she so hot a shrew as she's reported ?
Art thou contented , Jew ?
Some men there are love not a gaping pig , Some that are mad if they behold a cat , And others , when the bagpipe sings i ' th ' nose , Can not contain their urine .
Come , let's do so .
Have patience and endure .
Bring a corollary , Rather than want a spirit .
Do , good friend .
Seek him , bid him come hither .
All thy tediousness on me , ah ?
Being so frustrate , tell him , he mocks The pauses that he makes .
I will not take her on gift of any man .
Why then , God forgive me .
Leave me with haste .
Pleaseth you walk with me down to his house , I will discharge my bond and thank you too .
Faith , stay here this night .
Sir , by your patience : if I heard you rightly , The duke hath put on a religious life And thrown into neglect the pompous court .
But he that will believe all that they say shall never be saved by half that they do .
Murder !
Good madam , keep yourself within yourself .
Plain and not honest is too harsh a style .
I think I told your lordship a year since how much I am in the favor of Margaret , the waiting gentlewoman to Hero .
If we do meet again , we'll smile indeed .
Then , if ever thou dar'st acknowledge it , I will make it my quarrel .
Alas , you know not .
God save your Majesty .
The sound is going away .
In debating which was best , we shall part with neither .
Wooed me to steal it , but she so loves the token ( For he conjured her she should ever keep it ) That she reserves it evermore about her To kiss and talk to .
Stand fast together , lest some friend of Caesar's Should chance , Talk not of standing. , Publius , good cheer .
To make society The sweeter welcome , we will keep ourself Till suppertime alone .
O mighty Caesar !
You will compel me , then , to read the will ?
He is .
And here's another , Writ in my cousin's hand , stol'n from her pocket , Containing her affection unto Benedick .
Since I am crept in favor with myself , I will maintain it with some little cost .
The skies , the fountains , every region near Seemed all one mutual cry .
And so had I , but yet , for fashion sake , I thank you too for your society .
Tell me .
May she give that ?
All that glisters is not gold , Often have you heard that told .
Do not doubt , Cassio , But I will have my lord and you again As friendly as you were .
Thyself art coming To see performed the dreaded act which thou So sought'st to hinder .
But what's the matter , Clarence ?
But say , I prithee , is he coming home ?
Would it not grieve a woman to be overmastered with a piece of valiant dust ?
Reserve them till a merrier hour than this .
It beckons you to go away with it , As if it some impartment did desire To you alone .
You do not mind the play .
I had rather have a fool to make me merry than experience to make me sad , and to travel for it , too .
As I am an honest man , he looks pale. , Art thou sick , or angry ?
For your father's remembrance , be at accord .

You pay him then .
Some friendship will it lend you 'gainst the tempest .
Sola !
This business is well ended .
For these two hours , Rosalind , I will leave thee .
Strumpet , I come .
Tis not the king that sends you to the Tower .
Bid her come hither .
My lord , upon the platform where we watch .
What , in the midst of the street ?
Whence are you , sir ?
You shall close prisoner rest Till that the nature of your fault be known To the Venetian state. , Come , bring him away .
I remember The first time ever Caesar put it on .
Ay , my lord .
You come not Like Caesar's sister .
Nor nothing in your letters writ of her ?
At last I left them I ' th ' filthy-mantled pool beyond your cell , There dancing up to th ' chins , that the foul lake O'erstunk their feet .
Alas , poor shepherd , searching of thy wound , I have by hard adventure found mine own .
He's dead and rotten .
Take them in .
Complain unto the Duke of this indignity .
That which hath made them drunk hath made me bold .
O upright , just , and true-disposing God , How do I thank thee that this carnal cur Preys on the issue of his mother's body And makes her pew-fellow with others ' moan !
All which time Before the gods my knee shall bow my prayers To them for you .
Caesar's will ?
It should be , But he is drowned , and these are devils .
And in the morning early will we both Fly toward Belmont .
Oh , that your Highness knew my heart in this : I never loved my brother in my life .
To die , to sleep , No more , and by a sleep to say we end The heartache and the thousand natural shocks That flesh is heir to , 'tis a consummation Devoutly to be wished !
Most meet That first we come to words , and therefore have we Our written purposes before us sent , Which , if thou hast considered , let us know If 'twill tie up thy discontented sword And carry back to Sicily much tall youth That else must perish here .
Come , blade , my breast imbrue .
Go , good Tubal .
Well , we shall see your bearing .
Confess ! , Handkerchief ! , Oh , devil ! , Work on , My medicine , work !
Enough , I am engaged .
I thank you , madam .
Is this the Prince's brother ?
I could do more to do Antonius good , But 'twould offend him , and in his offense Should my performance perish .
Charles , I thank thee for thy love to me , which thou shalt find I will most kindly requite .
You know me well .
His passport shall be made , And crowns for convoy put into his purse .
Fie on thee , wretch .
If thou the next night following enjoy not Desdemona , take me from this world with treachery and devise engines for my life .
You shall Have letters from me to some friends that will Sweep your way for you .
Not with salt tears .
Why , so .
I hope this passionate humor of mine will change .
I'll put a girdle round about the Earth In forty minutes .
Come , brands , ho , firebrands .
I am Christophero Sly .
Lights , lights , lights !
Will not he ?
Farewell , my dearest sister , fare thee well .
Himself .
Ay , by heaven , my lord .
There I shall see mine own figure .
She sent for you by Dromio home to dinner .
Let's mock the midnight bell .
I see these witches are afraid of swords .
How now , Oswald ?
Therefore depart and leave him here with me .
Thy mother was a piece of virtue and She said thou wast my daughter .
I will physic your rankness and yet give no thousand crowns neither. , Holla , Dennis !
Heaven would that she these gifts should have And I to live and die her slave .
What offense , sweet Beatrice ?
Send for him , good uncle .
Rosalind is your love's name ?
I know not , gentlemen , what you intend , Who else must be let blood , who else is rank .
Once more remove , good friends .
Let him come in .
No , you shall paint when you are old .
I am sorry for thee .
His eyes were green as leeks .
All's one .
Charmian !
Master , some show to welcome us to town .
And thereof came it that the man was mad .
Am I a coward ?
And wherefore are you gentle , strong , and valiant ?
Fear not , my lord .
Nothing , good monsieur , but to help Cavalery Cobweb to scratch .
Has this fellow no feeling of his business ?
Only be patient till we have appeased The multitude , beside themselves with fear , And then we will deliver you the cause , Why I , that did love Caesar when I struck him , Have thus proceeded .
Draw and come .
Then let your servants bring my husband forth .
Within this hour it will be dinnertime .
This it is : 'T is better that the enemy seek us .
No , faith , my coz , wish not a man from England .
What beast was 't , then , That made you break this enterprise to me ?
Art thou my son ?
Informed them" ?
Fear nothing .
Fail not our feast .
I think it is the weakness of mine eyes That shapes this monstrous apparition .
I am Launcelot , your boy that was , your son that is , your child that shall be .
I do beseech you That are of suppler joints , follow them swiftly And hinder them from what this ecstasy May now provoke them to .
He's worth more sorrow , And that I'll spend for him .
Now , where's your master ?
In the great hand of God I stand , and thence Against the undivulged pretense I fight Of treasonous malice .
thieves !
Now must the world point at poor Katherine And say , "Lo , there is mad Petruchio's wife , If it would please him come and marry her ! " Upon my life , Petruchio means but well , Whatever fortune stays him from his word : Though he be blunt , I know him passing wise ; Though he be merry , yet withal he's honest .
What think you of the Scottish lord , his neighbor ?
Nay , do not quarrel with us , good old man .
O Phoebe , Phoebe , Phoebe !
It only stands Our lives upon to use our strongest hands .
I will so .
And look , where Publius is come to fetch me .
But for your husband , He is noble , wise , judicious , and best knows The fits o ' th ' season .
Thou seest these lovers seek a place to fight .
And his kinsman too .
By computation and mine host's report , I could not speak with Dromio since at first I sent him from the mart .
Not I .
Arm you , I pray you , to this speedy voyage .
Thou hast by moonlight at her window sung With feigning voice verses of feigning love , And stol'n the impression of her fantasy With bracelets of thy hair , rings , gauds , conceits , Knacks , trifles , nosegays , sweetmeats , messengers Of strong prevailment in unhardened youth .
I dare pawn down my life for him that he hath wrote this to feel my affection to your honor and to no other pretense of danger .
Tis midnight .
Let our best heads Know that tomorrow the last of many battles We mean to fight .
I'll not budge an inch , boy .
The bark is ready and the wind at help , Th ' associates tend , and everything is bent For England .
Will money buy 'em ?
And how was that ta'en up ?
I think he thinks upon the savage bull .
What , shall one of us That struck the foremost man of all this world But for supporting robbers , shall we now Contaminate our fingers with base bribes , And sell the mighty space of our large honors For so much trash as may be grasped thus ?
Farewell , farewell .
See where she comes and brings your froward wives As prisoners to her womanly persuasion. , Katherine , that cap of yours becomes you not .
Yet would I knew That stroke would prove the worst !
Peace , Smulkin .
Thou liest , abhorred tyrant .
Master , I am here entered in bond for you .
Strange things I have in head , that will to hand , Which must be acted ere they may be scanned .
They bleed on both sides. , How is it , my lord ?
Stand , ho !
Do you question me as an honest man should do , for my simple true judgment ?
My cousin's a fool , and thou art another .
I thank you , gentle uncle .
Out of doubt he is transported .
It is .
As you from crimes would pardoned be , Let your indulgence set me free .
Well then , no more but this : go , gentle Catesby , And , as it were far off , sound thou Lord Hastings How he doth stand affected to our purpose And summon him tomorrow to the Tower To sit about the coronation .
Shall I hear from you anon ?
Now gods that we adore , whereof comes this ?
Basting .
And thus thy fall hath left a kind of blot To mark the full-fraught man and best endued With some suspicion .
May we do so ?
See thou dissemble not .
Now , by the faith of my love , I will .
Poor souls , they perished .
I , not remembering how I cried out then , Will cry it o'er again .
O , gentlemen , see , see dead Henry's wounds Open their congealed mouths and bleed afresh ! , Blush , blush , thou lump of foul deformity , For 'tis thy presence that exhales this blood From cold and empty veins where no blood dwells .
Thou dost talk nothing to me .
For that goes hard .
Send him but hither and I'll fashion him .
For Michael Cassio , I dare be sworn , I think , that he is honest .
Dismiss your attendant there , look 't be done .
Here , at thy hand .
They vanished strangely .
Sir , pardon me in what I have to say .
I must leave you .
The ears are senseless that should give us hearing , To tell him his commandment is fulfilled , That Rosencrantz and Guildenstern are dead .
Thieves !
A credulous father , and a brother noble , Whose nature is so far from doing harms That he suspects none , on whose foolish honesty My practices ride easy .
Good sir , be a man , Think every bearded fellow that's but yoked May draw with you .
I am so much a fool , should I stay longer It would be my disgrace and your discomfort .
No , indeed are they not .
Stanley did dream the boar did raze his helm , And I did scorn it and disdain to fly .
Past all expressing .
I can not speak to her , yet she urged conference .
What says the golden chest ?
You did .
He's bound unto Octavia .
Is 't possible ?
Look what I speak , or do , or think to do , You are still crossing it .
An if I could , what should I get therefore ?
As it ebbs , the seedsman Upon the slime and ooze scatters his grain , And shortly comes to harvest .
For often , with a solemn earnestness , More than indeed belonged to such a trifle , He begged of me to steal it .
Young fry of treachery !
I will lay trust upon thee , and thou shalt find a dearer father in my love .
Where is your sister , and Hortensio's wife ?
The thane of Fife had a wife .
Not being Fortune , he's but Fortune's knave , A minister of her will .
Do you not hear it ring ?
Justice , find the girl !
How many goodly creatures are there here !
If that be all , masters , I hear no harm .
Tis very strange .
If he do resist , Subdue him at his peril !
What , think you we are Turks or infidels ?
Why , then thou canst not break her to the lute ?
Patience , gentle Audrey .
Oh , did he so ?
Let us score their backs And snatch 'em up , as we take hares , behind !
I knew it would be your answer .
Yes , Shylock , I will seal unto this bond .
When is the royal day ?
Me , uncle ?
What mean you , Caesar ?
Most sure and vulgar .
Take a trumpet , herald .
You shall do marvelous wisely , good Reynaldo , Before you visit him , to make inquire Of his behavior .
Sola , sola !
Thou know'st where I will tarry .
O Margaret , Margaret , now thy heavy curse Is lighted on poor Hastings ' wretched head .
So kind a father ! , Be my horses ready ?
Did you see him ?
Fair Beatrice , I thank you for your pains .
Your wrongs do set a scandal on my sex .
Ay , to me .
There is an old poor man Who after me hath many a weary step Limped in pure love .
Alas , why would you heap this care on me ?
But , good Laertes , Will you do this , keep close within your chamber .
But there is never a fair woman has a true face .
So take her to thee , shepherd .
Tis monstrous .
Only in the world I fill up a place which may be better supplied when I have made it empty .
I could make as true a boast as that if I had a sow to my mistress .
Trouble him no more Till further settling .
O these deliberate fools !
I confess two sleeves .
Pray heaven I be deceived in you .
And let the wise man fly .
Through the sharp hawthorn blows the cold wind .
Oh , help !
Past the mid season .
Let me hear from you .
Give me some light , away !
Ophelia , walk you here .
For me , the gold of France did not seduce , Although I did admit it as a motive The sooner to effect what I intended ; But God be thanked for prevention , Which I in sufferance heartily will rejoice , Beseeching God and you to pardon me .
No .
March on , march on , since we are up in arms , If not to fight with foreign enemies , Yet to beat down these rebels here at home .
But for the handkerchief , By heaven , I would most gladly have forgot it .
She wished she had not heard it , yet she wished That heaven had made her such a man .
Very well .
As thick as tale Can post with post , and every one did bear Thy praises in his kingdom's great defense , And poured them down before him .
Is 't not the king ?
Pooh , you speak like a green girl , Unsifted in such perilous circumstance .
An angel is like you , Kate , and you are like an angel .
None that I more love than myself .
Emilia , run you to the citadel And tell my lord and lady what hath happed. , Will you go on afore ?
Ay , mother , but I would not have it so .
He may command me as my sovereign , But you have power in me as in a kinsman .
For , by this heaven , now at our sorrows pale , Say what thou canst , I'll go along with thee .
Your worship was wont to tell me that I could do nothing without bidding .
And what noise is this ?
No doubt , my liege , if each man do his best .
Do you know me , sir ?
Richmond is on the seas .
What , household stuff ?
God keep your Lordship in that gracious mind .
All offices are open , and there is full liberty of feasting from this present hour of five till the bell have told eleven .
How if I answer "No" ?
Touch her soft mouth , and march .
Faith , sir , so-so .
I could well forbear 't .
All blessed secrets , All you unpublished virtues of the earth , Spring with my tears .
I do lack some part Of that quick spirit that is in Antony .
My most dear Gloucester !
Why , the night gone by .
Welcome , dear madam .
If you say , I hope you will not kill me .
I say it is the moon .
She well instructs me .
Ay , thou poor ghost , whiles memory holds a seat In this distracted globe .
They swore you did .
I am but mad north-north-west .
The very head and front of my offending Hath this extent , no more .
I'll follow him no more with bootless prayers .
And why should Caesar be a tyrant then ?
O piteous spectacle !
Thence I have followed it , Or it hath drawn me rather .
No more amazement .
Tis sweating labor To bear such idleness so near the heart As Cleopatra this .
I'll tell you who time ambles withal , who time trots withal , who time gallops withal , and who he stands still withal .
Why , how now , cousin !
I had it of Leah when I was a bachelor .
Lovers , to bed .
How does my royal lord ?
My mind hath been as big as one of yours , My heart as great , my reason haply more , To bandy word for word and frown for frown .
Be better suited .
My young master doth expect your reproach .
Marry , I would not do such a thing for a joint-ring , nor for measures of lawn , nor for gowns , petticoats , nor caps , nor any petty exhibition .
It is with a good will .
I myself heard the king say he would not be ransomed .
Art thou afeard ?
Come on .
These are but wild and whirling words , my lord .
Therein , ye gods , you tyrants do defeat .
Murder , murder !
Alas , what ignorant sin have I committed ?
Nay , stay .
How green !
Why , because he was mad .
Vengeance , plague , death , confusion !
Well , here's my comfort .
O , 'twas the foulest deed to slay that babe , And the most merciless that e'er was heard of !
Leave you !
Keep your word , Silvius , that you'll marry her If she refuse me .
Then do but say to me what I should do That in your knowledge may by me be done , And I am pressed unto it .
Belike they had some notice of the people How I had moved them .
That is hot ice and wondrous strange snow .
Tell the hot duke that Lear , No , but not yet .
Where is the evidence that doth accuse me ?
O Regan , she hath tied Sharp-toothed unkindness , like a vulture , here .
But tell me , is young George Stanley living ?
By Chrish , la , 'tish ill done .
You have too much respect upon the world .
I like the new tire within excellently , if the hair were a thought browner ; and your gown's a most rare fashion , i ' faith .
Canidius and the rest That fell away have entertainment but No honorable trust .
Pray you , leave your courtesy , good monsieur .
Upon the stroke of four .
And this same progeny of evils comes From our debate , from our dissension .
Yet you have all the vantage of her wrong .
Is she not apt ?
By running fast .
Do you hear , Cassio ?
She thanked me And bade me , if I had a friend that loved her , I should but teach him how to tell my story And that would woo her .
Who's there ?
Happily met , the happier for thy son .
Thus I mend it : Time himself is bald and therefore , to the world's end , will have bald followers .
What is 't you seek ?
But his flawed heart , Alack , too weak the conflict to support , 'Twixt two extremes of passion , joy and grief , Burst smilingly .
The very instant that I saw you did My heart fly to your service , there resides To make me slave to it , and for your sake Am I this patient log-man .
My lord , I came to see your father's funeral .
Then , by myself , Thyself is self-misused .
Come down , behold no more .
I will speak lower .
Welcome , Signior .
Let's think 't unsafe To come in to the cry without more help .
Say that I wish he never find more cause To change a master .
The saddler had it , sir ; I kept it not .
Truly , an obedient lady .
I would have sworn it had , my lord , especially against Benedick .
What canst thou swear by now ?
He hath rid his prologue like a rough colt .
My best endeavours shall be done herein .
Those being all my study , The government I cast upon my brother And to my state grew stranger , being transported And rapt in secret studies .
Where is my love ?
For divers unknown reasons , I beseech you , Grant me this boon .
I must attend mine office , Or would have done 't myself .
I'll get me to a place more void , and there Speak to great Caesar as he comes along .
Horns ?
And God forbid , my dear and faithful lord , That you should fashion , wrest , or bow your reading , Or nicely charge your understanding soul With opening titles miscreate , whose right Suits not in native colors with the truth ; For God doth know how many now in health Shall drop their blood in approbation
Even for the blood That then I lost for thee , now grant me justice .
I prithee , good Grumio , tell me , how goes the world ?
You look pale , and gaze , And put on fear , and cast yourself in wonder To see the strange impatience of the heavens .
Be assured We go to use our hands and not our tongues .
And discourse fustian with one's own shadow ?
Let us come in , that we may bind him fast And bear him home for his recovery .
Ay , widow Dido .
Here comes the Emperor .
Still am I called. , Unhand me , gentlemen .
Quoth my master .
Good hay , sweet hay , hath no fellow .
Alas , he is betrayed and I undone .
You received no gold ?
You hear him all night .
If any be Trinculo's legs , these are they .
Wherefore , bold peasant , Darest thou support a published traitor ?
The plainsong" is most just , for humors do abound .
Why art thou angry ?
Farewell , good Launcelot .
Stand away , Captain Gower .
For my uncle is King of Denmark , and those that would make mouths at him while my father lived give twenty , forty , fifty , a hundred ducats apiece for his picture in little .
Ay , you would beg , Were you in my distress .
What is the course and drift of your compact ?
Conceit in weakest bodies strongest works .
My lord of Orleans , and my Lord High Constable , you talk of horse and armor ?
Ay , my lord .
For what good turn ?
I pity thy complaining .
None , man .
Take up her bed And bear her women from the monument .
Fear nothing .
Go sleep , and hear us .
Twere best he speak no harm of Brutus here .
Now , in good sadness , son Petruchio , I think thou hast the veriest shrew of all .
The king's a-bed .
I have an exposition of sleep come upon me .
So to most noble Caesar .
I am sorry to give breathing to my purpose , Help me away , dear Charmian !
And be assured you'll find a difference , As we his subjects have in wonder found , Between the promise of his greener days And these he masters now .
Yes , madam , he was of that consort .
I was sure your lordship did not give it me .
Is it within reason and compass ?
Pitchers have ears .
Tis well for thee That , being unseminared , thy freer thoughts May not fly forth of Egypt .
Is it honest in deed and word ?
Had I your tongues and eyes , I'd use them so That heaven's vault should crack .
Keep thee warm .
I do consent , Prick him down , Antony .
O sweet bully Bottom !
Good friend , I prithee , take him in thy arms .
Ay , madam , but returns again tonight .
What said he when he came unto himself ?
Will it never be day ?
And , gentle Puck , take this transformed scalp From off the head of this Athenian swain , That , he awaking when the other do , May all to Athens back again repair And think no more of this night's accidents But as the fierce vexation of a dream .
Is it even so ?
Are you good men and true ?
No , since .
Take up my mistress ' gown for thy master's use !
One woe doth tread upon another's heel , So fast they follow. , Your sister's drowned , Laertes .
What news abroad ?
Michael , good night .
Tis done already , and the messenger gone .
Carried to Colmekill , The sacred storehouse of his predecessors , And guardian of their bones .
Draw thy sword .
Adieu .
Tis fittest .
Fie , fie , 'tis lewd and filthy !
Here's another More potent than the first .
Husband , let's follow to see the end of this ado .
We doubt it nothing .
I am sorry For your displeasure , but all will sure be well .
To get his place and to plume up my will In double knavery .
The Moor hath killed my mistress !
Sir , here's the door .
Yet I love thee too .
Without contradiction I have heard that .
Nay , good my fellows , do not please sharp fate To grace it with your sorrows .
Wert thou not banished on pain of death ?
Let her send it .
Or that I had any friend would be a man for my sake !
My lord , that would dishonor him !
And when she put it on , she made me vow That I should neither sell nor give nor lose it .
Madam my interpreter , what says she ?
I heard him swear his affection .
So is Lysander .
Get thee a wife , get thee a wife .
There was a noise , That's verily .
Are you sure of that ?
Let me comply with you in this garb , lest my extent to the players , which , I tell you , must show fairly outwards , should more appear like entertainment than yours .
Let the trumpet sound .
I am gone , though I am here .
A good epithet !
I would rather have one of your father's getting .
Therefore this project
Yet it was said It should not stand in thy posterity , But that myself should be the root and father Of many kings .
Then let the trumpets sound The tucket sonance and the note to mount , For our approach shall so much dare the field That England shall couch down in fear and yield .
I'll make thee an example .
But look to it : Find out thy brother , wheresoe'er he is .
Is that his answer ?
Well , go to , I will .
Why should he stay , whom love doth press to go ?
Why dost thou ask ?
Then you must say "I take thee , Rosalind , for wife." I take thee , Rosalind , for wife .
Lysander , keep thy Hermia .
Yet fortune can not recompense me better Than to die well , and not my master's debtor .
But , for true need , You heavens , give me that patience , patience I need .
Since they did plot The means that dusky Dis my daughter got , Her and her blind boy's scandaled company I have forsworn .
Ring the alarum bell .
Wherefore ?
The wine of life is drawn , and the mere lees Is left this vault to brag of .
How's that ?
Is 't not your trick ?
Bind him , I say .
Tell your piteous heart There's no harm done .
Forever and a day .
Let me go .
But who is with him ?
Your loves , as mine to you .
Never believe it .
Why dost thou spit at me ?
Shall we call in th ' ambassador , my liege ?
Tis time I should inform thee farther .
O Lord , Lord , it is a hard matter for friends to meet , but mountains may be removed with earthquakes and so encounter .
Dry up in her the organs of increase , And from her derogate body never spring A babe to honor her .
Stay and speak !
The great contention of the sea and skies Parted our fellowship , But , hark !
Let her awhile be secretly kept in And publish it that she is dead indeed .
O you gods !
I almost die for food , and let me have it .
Come , good fellow , put thine iron on .
If thou read this , O Caesar , thou mayst live .
I care not for my spirits , if my legs were not weary .
Say again , where didst thou leave these varlets ?
The devil damn thee black , thou cream-faced loon !
Provoke him that he may .
A very weak monster .
Tis pity of him .
Bid them move away .
How do you mean , removing of him ?
Now they are my men .
It sorts well with your fierceness .
I drunk !
So the sins of my mother should be visited upon me .
Why , therefore fire , for I have caught extreme cold .
Nym , thou hast spoke the right .
Thy Clarence he is dead that stabbed my Edward , And the beholders of this frantic play , Th ' adulterate Hastings , Rivers , Vaughan , Grey , Untimely smothered in their dusky graves .
And that most deeply to consider is The beauty of his daughter .
Niece , will you look to those things I told you of ?
Nay , heaven doth know .
All disconsolate , With Pindarus his bondman on this hill .
I would I were , to be revenged on thee .
Ay , do .
Sit , worthy friends .
I doubt not of his temperance .
Be kind and courteous to this gentleman .
For God's sake , take a house .
But where's my fool ?
I serve you , madam .
He has no children .
Bring forth men-children only , For thy undaunted mettle should compose Nothing but males .
If he do , sure he can not weep 't back again .
We would be resolved , Before we hear him , of some things of weight That task our thoughts concerning us and France .
She speaks poniards , and every word stabs .
Well , happiness to their sheets !
By Jeshu , I am your Majesty's countryman , I care not who know it .
Here's one comes in his shirt , with light and weapons .
Take me up .
Casca , you are the first that rears your hand .
I do require them of you , so to use them As we shall find their merits and our safety May equally determine .
I can not wish the fault undone , the issue of it being so proper .
Over thy wounds now do I prophesy , Which , like dumb mouths , do ope their ruby lips To beg the voice and utterance of my tongue , A curse shall light upon the limbs of men .
Good morrow , masters .
Then I would you were so honest a man .
I have no more sons of the royal blood For thee to slaughter .
A blessed labor , my most sovereign lord .
Love wrought these miracles .
If trembling I inhabit then , protest me The baby of a girl .
I wear it for a memorable honor , For I am Welsh , you know , good countryman .
The breaking of so great a thing should make A greater crack .
Am I not stayed for ?
Rescue , fair lord , or else the day is lost !
Some other time .
My books and instruments shall be my company , On them to look and practice by myself .
That .
Where are thy two sons ?
But I hope you have no intent to turn husband , have you ?
Why , madam , if I were your father's dog , You should not use me so .
A man is master of his liberty ; Time is their master , and when they see time They'll go or come .
If thy speech be sooth , I care not if thou dost for me as much .
Modo he's called , and Mahu .
It shall to the barber's , with your beard. , Prithee , say on .
Call me what instrument you will , though you can fret me , yet you can not play upon me .
The revelers are entering , brother .
I pray you , let me see it .
Give me thy hand , Roderigo .
Here is the number of the slaughtered French .
I will not hold thee long .
What should I do I do not ?
Oh weary reckoning !
Where died she ?
Lord , let me never have a cause to sigh , Till I be brought to such a silly pass !
They stay upon your patience .
Faith , he is posted hence on serious matter .
But then I saw no harm , and then I heard Each syllable that breath made up between them .
No , truly not , although until last night I have this twelvemonth been her bedfellow .
A bridegroom , say you ?
And therefore haste away , For we must measure twenty miles today .
I saw Mark Antony offer him a crown ( yet 'twas not a crown neither , 'twas one of these coronets ) and , as I told you , he put it by once , but , for all that , to my thinking , he would fain have had it .
Be wise , and get you home .
I do , This touches me in reputation .
Nor hath Love's mind of any judgment taste , Wings and no eyes figure unheedy haste .
For that he dares us to 't .
Benedick , didst thou note the daughter of Signior Leonato ?
I do .
And fixed his eyes upon you ?
My love doth so approve him That even his stubbornness , his checks , his frowns , Prithee , unpin me , have grace and favor .
I found her trimming up the diadem On her dead mistress .
Look you , sad friends , The gods rebuke me , but it is tidings To wash the eyes of kings .
The town sounds a parley .
No , my lord .
I am content .
Truly , I have him , but I would not be the party that should desire you to touch him , for his biting is immortal .
Welcome hither .
County Claudio , when mean you to go to church ?
Saw you the weird sisters ?
This kindness will I show .
Hold !
Her head's declined , and death will seize her but Your comfort makes the rescue .
What a fearful night is this !
Adieu .
Forgot you !
Because that I familiarly sometimes Do use you for my fool and chat with you , Your sauciness will jest upon my love And make a common of my serious hours .
Come .
I have done no harm .
Speak within door .
Of one not easily jealous , but being wrought , Perplexed in the extreme .
Yet have I left a daughter .
Eight score eight hours ?
A wretched soul , bruised with adversity We bid be quiet when we hear it cry , But were we burdened with like weight of pain , As much or more we should ourselves complain .
We doubt not of a fair and lucky war , Since God so graciously hath brought to light This dangerous treason lurking in our way To hinder our beginnings .
But yet , Which , of he or Adrian , for a good wager , first begins to crow ?
Marry , God defend his grace should say us nay !
I tell you , Captain , if you look in the maps of the 'orld , I warrant you shall find , in the comparisons between Macedon and Monmouth , that the situations , look you , is both alike .
Enough .
So out went the candle and we were left darkling .
Touch me not so near .
A friend .
Here comes your father .
I promise you , my soul is very jocund In the remembrance of so fair a dream .
To see no pastime I .
He , of all the men that ever my foolish eyes looked upon , was the best deserving a fair lady .
Shall I know your answer ?
This looks not like a nuptial .
And with the juice of this I'll streak her eyes And make her full of hateful fantasies .
God make incision in thee ; thou art raw .
Peace !
What's the matter with thee now ?
I'll drain him dry as hay .
He hath been in unusual pleasure , and Sent forth great largess to your offices .
Interrupt the monster one word further , and , by this hand , I'll turn my mercy out o ' doors and make a stockfish of thee .
There is none but he Whose being I do fear , and under him My genius is rebuked , as it is said Mark Antony's was by Caesar .
Let me tell you , Cassius , you yourself Are much condemned to have an itching palm , To sell and mart your offices for gold To undeservers .
My lord , when at their home I did commend your highness ' letters to them .
But if you know not this my manners tell me We have your wrong rebuke .
How does lieutenant Cassio ?
Did you confer with him ?
Go , get thee hence .
Dost thou lie still ?
He hath not told his thought to the king ?
I take my leave of you .
Scratch my head , Peaseblossom .
It should seem then that Dobbin's tail grows backward .
I will do 't .
Thy loving father , Hamlet .
Gone ?
And is 't not to be damned To let this canker of our nature come In further evil ?
Be valiant , and speed well .
Say that the last I spoke was "Antony , " And word it , prithee , piteously .
Where are they ?
Drink , servant-monster , when I bid thee .
Carthage ?
So dear I loved the man that I must weep .
Who hath sent thee now ?
O villain , thou hast stolen both mine office and my name !
True or false , it hath made thee Earl of Gloucester .
Such was the very armour he had on When he the ambitious Norway combated .
Horses are tied by the heads , dogs and bears by the neck , monkeys by the loins , and men by the legs .
Yes , faith .
Will you go , coz ?
Wake when some vile thing is near .
A ship you sent me to , to hire waftage .
Small cheer and great welcome makes a merry feast .
Get your apparel together , good strings to your beards , new ribbons to your pumps .
Oh , when she had writ it and was reading it over , she found "Benedick" and "Beatrice" between the sheet ?
Doth the moon shine that night we play our play ?
I , sir , am Dromio .
Confusion now hath made his masterpiece .
If it had been painful , I would not have come .
The games are done and Caesar is returning .
But , gentle heavens , Cut short all intermission .
For mine own good , All causes shall give way .
For his valor can not carry his discretion , and the fox carries the goose .
Oh ho , oh ho !
Therefore I do advise you , take this note .
Nor I , my lord , in faith .
He sends to know if your pleasure hold to play with Laertes , or that you will take longer time .
I should not then ask Casca what had chanced .
There thou mightst behold the great image of authority : a dog's obeyed in office .
Sweet Desdemona !
Lay them in gore , Since you have shore With shears his thread of silk .
O ill-dispersing wind of misery !
He hath been a courtier , he swears .
You beastly knave , know you no reverence ?
Since the torch is out , Lie down and stray no farther .
My honored lord !
These things , come thus to light , Smother her spirits up .
Hold , take my sword .
It is indifferent cold , my lord , indeed .
Ha ?
These Moors are changeable in their wills , fill thy purse with money .
God keep me from false friends , but they were none .
You make me study of that .
No sovereignty , Yet he would be king on 't .
Or here , or at the Capitol .
Too long a pause for that which you find there .
Then let us both be sudden .
My fair Bianca , bid my father welcome , While I with selfsame kindness welcome thine .
Go , Pindarus , get higher on that hill .
And in their ship I am sure Lorenzo is not .
Now , Iras , what think'st thou ?
And those that leave their valiant bones in France , Dying like men though buried in your dunghills , They shall be famed ; for there the sun shall greet them And draw their honors reeking up to heaven , Leaving their earthly parts to choke your clime ,
What ?
Let me question more in particular .
This was not counterfeit .
Is Banquo gone from court ?
No , wench !
Is he alone ?
Go to thy cold bed and warm thee .
Not now .
Call you ?
What do I see on thee ?
Be not you ashamed to show , he'll not shame to tell you what it means .
I never gave him cause .
So hath my lord dared him to single fight .
Come out o ' th ' storm .
Nay , then .
I am ready now .
Heaven knows what she has known .
And therefore as a stranger give it welcome .
Though others have the arm , show us the sleeve ; We in your motion turn , and you may move us .
Go to your rest .
I am not so reputed !
I'll have the work ta'en out And give 't Iago .
I am boy to them all three , but all they three , though they would serve me , could not be man to me .
Mark Antony is in your tents , my lord .
I'll have no speaking .
It follows , then , the cat must stay at home .
My visor is Philemon's roof ; within the house is Jove .
Messala !
That eye that told you so looked but asquint .
Come , shall I make you two friends ?
I swear I'll cuff you if you strike again .
He is drowned Whom thus we stray to find , and the sea mocks Our frustrate search on land .
God defend me from these two !
They are not ever jealous for the cause , But jealous for they're jealous .
I know you what you are , And like a sister am most loath to call Your faults as they are named .
We'll to th' river .
Twill be recorded for a precedent , And many an error by the same example Will rush into the state .
Madam !
A good old commander and a most kind gentleman .
Oh , these flaws and starts , Impostors to true fear , would well become A woman's story at a winter's fire , Authorized by her grandam .
Thus must I from the smoke into the smother , From tyrant duke unto a tyrant brother .
My old bones ache .
But she is now the wife of Marcus Antonius .
If I do not put on a sober habit , Talk with respect and swear but now and then , Wear prayer books in my pocket , look demurely , Nay more .
Ah , he is young , and his minority Is put unto the trust of Richard Gloucester , A man that loves not me nor none of you .
Let that appear hereafter , and aim better at me by that I now will manifest .
I saw the Duchess of Milan's gown that they praise so .
If I live to see it , I will never trust his word after .
He , when he hears of her , can not refrain From the excess of laughter .
I never saw her till this time .
His fault is much , and the good king his master Will check him for 't .
Never did I know A creature that did bear the shape of man So keen and greedy to confound a man .
For charitable prayers Shards , flints and pebbles should be thrown on her .
I have already .
None good , my liege , to please you with the hearing , Nor none so bad but well may be reported .
Go thou with me , and let me counsel thee .
Who are you ?
That I did for him .
He will to his Egyptian dish again .
Ha , ha , ha !
She mocks all her wooers out of suit .
Not a false gallop .
Pray , set it down and rest you .
Let's see once more this saying graved in gold , "Who chooseth me shall gain what many men desire." Why , that's the lady .
If this uncouth forest yield anything savage , I will either be food for it or bring it for food to thee .
The business she hath broached in the state Can not endure my absence .
I shall do my friends no wrong , for I have none to lament me ; the world no injury , for in it I have nothing .
I'll bring you to him .
And let those that play your clowns speak no more than is set down for them , for there be of them that will themselves laugh to set on some quantity of barren spectators to laugh too , though in the meantime some necessary question of the play be then to be considered .
How long hath this possession held the man ?
Now , if thou wert a poet , I might have some hope thou didst feign .
Why , so I did , but looked for no reply .
I hourly learn A doctrine of obedience , and would gladly Look him i' th' face .
My letters say a hundred and seven galleys .
My lord , I can not .
Let our officers Have notice what we purpose .
Now is it Rome indeed , and room enough , When there is in it but one only man .
My charms crack not , my spirits obey , and time Goes upright with his carriage .
Tis most convenient .
What trade , thou knave ?
I am not drunk now .
With all my heart , and much it joys me too To see you are become so penitent. , Tressel and Berkeley , go along with me .
Hearty thanks .
Yet do I not use my horse for my mistress , or any such proverb so little kin to the purpose .
So , I am satisfied .
Ha !
But she as far surpasseth Sycorax As great'st does least .
Till Birnam Wood remove to Dunsinane I can not taint with fear .
Hence , away !
To have a foolish wife .
I will have nothing else but only this .
Let not the heavens hear these telltale women Rail on the Lord's anointed .
What ring gave you my lord ?
Why of thy thought , Iago ?
Oh , horrible , oh , horrible , most horrible !
Sheathe your dagger .
He doth indeed show some sparks that are like wit .
I did , my lord .
And , as I am an honest Puck , If we have unearned luck Now to 'scape the serpent's tongue , We will make amends ere long .
What a blow was there given !
By this hand , Claudio shall render me a dear account .
Therefore be cheered .
Let her alone .
Oh , my dear Cassio !
I would fain learn to lie .
Hang thou there upon the tomb , Praising her when I am dumb .
Of this discourse we more will hear anon. , Egeus , I will overbear your will .
And for my means , I'll husband them so well , They shall go far with little .
Too old to be engaged to young .
O wicked Wall through whom I see no bliss !
Hark !
Tis wonder that thy life and wits at once Had not concluded all. , He wakes .
And so I am , I am .
Who knows he is ?
And so I shall catch the fly , your cousin , in the latter end and she must be blind too .
Know I these men that come along with you ?
Yet Caesar shall go forth , for these predictions Are to the world in general as to Caesar .
I wonder that you will still be talking , Signor Benedick .
Cassio's a proper man .
How dost thou like the Lord Bassanio's wife ?
Father , in .
If thou didst ever hold me in thy heart Absent thee from felicity a while , And in this harsh world draw thy breath in pain To tell my story .
Go but with me tonight , you shall see her chamber window entered , even the night before her wedding day .
Here's Lucentio , right son to the right Vincentio , That have by marriage made thy daughter mine While counterfeit supposes bleared thine eyne .
Do you hear aught , sir , of a battle toward ?
He was a man .
Wit shall not go unrewarded while I am king of this country .
Sola , sola !
Let's tonight Be bounteous at our meal .
He says his name is Master Fer .
See not your bride in these unreverent robes .
Who calls ?
Had we done so at first , we had droven them home With clouts about their heads .
Ah , Desdemona , away , away , away !
What enterprise , Popillius ?
Is there any way to show such friendship ?
Within these ten days if that thou beest found So near our public court as twenty miles , Thou diest for it .
I found it thrown in at the casement of my closet .
I stay too long .
But ships are but boards , sailors but men .
Tis too narrow for your mind .
What is the news ?
There is no other way , Unless thou couldst put on some other shape And not be Richard , that hath done all this .
Your worship's friend and Launcelot , sir .
You are full of pretty answers .
How otherwise ? , Will you be ruled by me ?
I learned it in England where indeed they are most potent in potting .
As I suck blood , I will some mercy show .
Mistake no more .
Now , my lord , what shall we do , if we perceive Lord Hastings will not yield to our complots ?
All this done , Repair to Pompey's porch , where you shall find us .
She is dead .
It is a beast for Perseus .
A spirit ?
A foolish thought , to say a sorry sight .
From this time forth I never will speak word .
So shall you quietly enjoy your hope And marry sweet Bianca with consent .
Why look you pale ?
The noble Brutus Hath told you Caesar was ambitious .
Take that , and that .
For your part , To you our swords have leaden points , Mark Antony .
Who can be wise , amazed , temp'rate , and furious , Loyal and neutral , in a moment ?
Well praised !
Mark his condition and the event .
Besides , the king's name is a tower of strength Which they upon the adverse party want .
Talk not , Signior Gremio .
It proves not so .
I humbly thank your ladyship .
Why then , the devil give him good of it !
I'll give you a verse to this note that I made yesterday in despite of my invention .
I would your grace would constrain me to tell .
You English princes all , I do salute you .
Yes , gracious madam .
Methinks she should not use a long one for such a Pyramus .
For , as it is a heartbreaking to see a handsome man loose-wived , so it is a deadly sorrow to behold a foul knave uncuckolded .
That shall you know hereafter .
O Hamlet , thou hast cleft my heart in twain .
How does my good Lord Hamlet ?

And the tears of it are wet .
My Lord of Warwick , here is , praised be God for it , a most contagious treason come to light , look you , as you shall desire in a summer's day .
O sir , pardon me !
Revenges burn in them , for their dear causes Would to the bleeding and the grim alarm Excite the mortified man .
Banquo and Macbeth , all hail !
From all such devils , good Lord , deliver us !
In brief , for so the season bids us be , Prepare thy battle early in the morning , And put thy fortune to the arbitrament Of bloody strokes and mortal-staring war .
Well , Catesby , ere a fortnight make me older I'll send some packing that yet think not on 't .
Why , there , there , there , there !
I do not , till you practice them on me .
You think of him too much .
But she perforce withholds the loved boy , Crowns him with flowers , and makes him all her joy .
How now , spirit ?
Tell me , good Brutus , can you see your face ?
Take to you no hard thoughts .
Your grace hath laid the odds o ' th ' weaker side .
Good bawcock , 'bate thy rage .
I mean , in a sort .
Will you give her o'er ?
Pray you do not , sir .
I'll tell you , there is good men porn at Monmouth .
Observe how Antony becomes his flaw , And what thou think'st his very action speaks In every power that moves .
Peace , I say !
Hang out our banners on the outward walls .
Space enough Have I in such a prison .
For Christian shame , put by this barbarous brawl .
O , sixpence , that I had o ' Wednesday last To pay the saddler for my mistress ' crupper ?
Who ambles time withal ?
Ho , let the door be locked .
Good morrow , Caesar .
Their preparation is today by sea .
As 'tis said , the bastard son of Gloucester .
Peace !
Well , I will thither .
I find it still , when I have leave to sleep .
Fie , fie !
Faith , her privates we .
To the death , my lord .
Such duty as the subject owes the prince , Even such a woman oweth to her husband .
But I have , sir , a son by order of law , some year older than this , who yet is no dearer in my account .
Hast thou drunk well ?
Pray you , sir , stand up .
For lead ?
We see it and will say it .
I have been to seek you .
Ha , ha , heard in Genoa .
The one of them imports The death of Cassio to be undertook By Roderigo .
Hast thou the flower there ?
But those that understood him smiled at one another and shook their heads .
What do you mean ?
Good morrow to this fair assembly .
But , sirrah , you shall buy this sport as dear As all the metal in your shop will answer .
The venom of such looks , we fairly hope , Have lost their quality , and that this day Shall change all griefs and quarrels into love .
No news of them ?
But if thy love were ever like to mine , As sure I think did never man love so , How many actions most ridiculous Hast thou been drawn to by thy fantasy ?
A marvelous witty fellow , I assure you , but I will go about with him. , Come you hither , sirrah , a word in your ear .
You say you are a better soldier .
There are the players .
Maintain a mourning ostentation , And on your family's old monument Hang mournful epitaphs and do all rites That appertain unto a burial .
I would the lightning had Burnt up those logs that you are enjoined to pile !
Make we our march towards Birnam .
Call them forth .
They are , my lord .
Is he dead ?
Therefore , put money in thy purse .
The law hath yet another hold on you .
Have you no more to say ?
Go to , I'll no more on 't .
Why , what's the matter ?
Pish !
She's framed as fruitful As the free elements .
Ha !

Montjoy .
Why , so didst thou .
Here , catch this casket .
Let us go .

It can not be .
What says Polonius ?
If much you note him , You shall offend him and extend his passion .
But oh , how oddly will it sound that I Must ask my child forgiveness !
What is 't , my lord ?
Be not disturbed with my infirmity .
My leg is cut in two .
Our course will seem too bloody , Caius Cassius , To cut the head off and then hack the limbs , Like wrath in death and envy afterwards , For Antony is but a limb of Caesar .
Let it fall rather , though the fork invade The region of my heart .
Tomorrow , then , I judge a happy day .
They do me wrong , and I will not endure it !

Our knocking has awaked him .
No more .
Pray , give me that .

But I have heard him oft maintain it to be fit that , sons at perfect age and fathers declined , the father should be as ward to the son , and the son manage his revenue .
Against my will , I am sent to bid you come in to dinner .
For I tell you , father , I am as peremptory as she proud-minded ; And where two raging fires meet together , They do consume the thing that feeds their fury .
My lord , his throat is cut .
Thither will I invite the duke and all's contented followers .
Will you grant with me That Ferdinand is drowned ?
Answer as I call you. , Nick Bottom , the weaver ?
Yet am I noble as the adversary I come to cope withal .
The sun !
Oh , me , lieutenant !
Hold you , there is a groat to heal your pate .
I hear it now above me .
I pray you , sirs , lie in my tent and sleep .
Pray you , go with us .
And now I have the boy , I will undo This hateful imperfection of her eyes .
No .
Do you put tricks upon 's with savages and men of Ind , ha ?
When it appears to you where this begins , Turn your displeasure that way , for our faults Can never be so equal that your love Can equally move with them .
No , indeed , my lord .
What's that , my lord ?
Now sir , be judge yourself , Whether I in any just term am affined To love the Moor .
The shrill-gorged lark so far Can not be seen or heard .
My father's love is enough to honor him .
The sun is high , and we outwear the day .
It is much that the Moor should be more than reason .
Wherefore !
What stay had I but Edward ?
Oh , my lord , wisdom and blood combating in so tender a body , we have ten proofs to one that blood hath the victory .
Come , the recorders !
And art thou living , Stephano ?
Will you enforce me to a world of cares ?
Thou say'st the king grows mad .
My dear lord , You know the fiery quality of the duke , How unremoveable and fixed he is In his own course .
Is not this well ?
And I must Rid all the sea of pirates , then , to send Measures of wheat to Rome .

What , will you murder me ? , Thou jailer , thou , I am thy prisoner .
There is no other way .
Do you confess so much ?
Therefore be merry , Cassio , For thy solicitor shall rather die Than give thy cause away .
So is the bargain .
O Kate , nice customs curtsy to great kings .
To the health of our general !
His breeding , sir , hath been at my charge .
I little thought You would have followed .
And I another So weary with disasters , tugged with fortune , That I would set my life on any chance , To mend it or be rid on 't .
Be warned by me , then : they that ride so , and ride not warily , fall into foul bogs .
Where is the foolish knave I sent before ?
Gratiano !
Your letters did withhold our breaking forth Till we perceived both how you were wrong led And we in negligent danger .
Cousin of Buckingham , a word with you .
What , my lord ?
This is Lucentio's house .
Nay , but Beatrice , Sweet Hero , she is wronged , she is slandered , she is undone .
Why , then 'tis time to arm and give direction .
I'll not be made a soft and dull-eyed fool To shake the head , relent and sigh , and yield To Christian intercessors .
But mark , poor knight , What dreadful dole is here !
What's the matter , lieutenant ?
He is at hand , and Pindarus is come To do you salutation from his master .
That's not an office for a friend , my lord .
Tell not me .
Feed and sleep .
This did I fear , but thought he had no weapon , For he was great of heart .
I do repent The tedious minutes I with her have spent .
I'll not be far from you .
Both one and other he denies me now .
If then that friend demand why Brutus rose against Caesar , this is my answer : not that I loved Caesar less , but that I loved Rome more .
How , the nonpareil !
Brutus is wise , and were he not in health , He would embrace the means to come by it .
And , as the jest did glance away from me , 'T is ten to one it maimed you two outright .
I must be one of these same dumb wise men , For Gratiano never lets me speak .
I do but stay till your marriage be consummate , and then go I toward Aragon .
Where be the sacred vials thou shouldst fill With sorrowful water ?
You mock me , sir .
Ay , better than him I am before knows me .

Let's hear him , for the things he speaks may concern Caesar .
With sweetest touches pierce your mistress ' ear , And draw her home with music .
Such as I am , I come from Antony .
How dost , my lord ?
Oh , but she'll keep her word .

What else ?
Give me thy hand , Messala .
Go seek him out , speak fair , and bring the body Into the chapel .
Sweet Phoebe , pity me .
Of whence , I pray ?
What news ?
Give me your hand .
Yet 'tis the plague to great ones , Prerogatived are they less than the base .
Sister , you'll go with us ?
Saint Davy's day is past .
If any , speak , for him have I offended .
Indeed , they are disproportioned .
My decayed fair A sunny look of his would soon repair .
Son , I'll be your half Bianca comes .
Shall we go send them dinners and fresh suits , And give their fasting horses provender , And after fight with them ?
Who comes here ?
Cleopatra , catching but the least noise of this , dies instantly .
It is the greatest admiration in the universal world when the true and aunchient prerogatifes and laws of the wars is not kept .
Enobarbus ?
Do not so .
You bid me make it orderly and well , According to the fashion and the time .
I know you are not ignorant , I would you did , sir .
Relent , and save your souls .
He sups tonight with a harlotry , and thither will I go to him .
She that doth call me husband , even my soul Doth for a wife abhor .
He is enamored on Hero .
For the which , as I told you , Antonio shall be bound .
Gracious my lord , I should report that which I say I saw , But know not how to do 't .
What , Lucius !
Pinion him like a thief , bring him before us .
What , and stake down ?
Bless thee , Bottom , bless thee .
Well , sir , I thank you .
Go thrust him out at gates , and let him smell His way to Dover .
Not on thy sole , but on thy soul , harsh Jew , Thou makest thy knife keen .
And I am sick when I look not on you .
No , unpin me here .
Lo you , here she comes .
That's the next to do .
Is she as tall as me ?
And I do with an eye of love requite her .
If it be so as so 'tis put on me , And that in way of caution , I must tell you , You do not understand yourself so clearly As it behooves my daughter and your honor .
Hear it apart .
To make you answer truly to your name .
By my troth , Nerissa , my little body is aweary of this great world .
To thee I do commend my watchful soul , Ere I let fall the windows of mine eyes .
I like him very well .
You have not been abed , then ?
My lord , you nod .
What is 't o'clock ?
Then shall I bleed to death .
The earth sings when he touches it .
Good sir , be patient .
On such a full sea are we now afloat , And we must take the current when it serves Or lose our ventures .
Where is he now ?
Now by my life , Old fools are babes again and must be used With checks as flatteries , when they are seen abused .
God keep me so. , Our heralds go with him .
Whilst you were here o'erwhelmed with your grief , A passion most resulting such a man , Cassio came hither .
Ish a villain and a basterd and a knave and a rascal .
You peasant swain !
Ah , how much might the man deserve of me that would right her !
Farewell .
Lo , where he comes !
I did not think , sir , to have met you here .
Why , sir , you know no house nor no such maid , Nor no such men as you have reckoned up , As Stephen Sly and old John Naps of Greece , And Peter Turph and Henry Pimpernell , And twenty more such names and men as these , Which never were , nor no man ever saw .
Hail .
You spoke not with her since ?
Then I know My answer must be made .
O sir , very well : here in your orchard .
No .
Get you gone And hasten your return .
Hence , saucy eunuch !
So , fare thee well .
How now !
Your hands , come then .
Then , prophetlike , They hailed him father to a line of kings .
And these does she apply for warnings and portents And evils imminent , and on her knee Hath begged that I will stay at home today .
Sick , oh , sick !
Were such things here as we do speak about ?
Donalbain .
Sir , this should be answered .
Come , temperate nymphs , and help to celebrate A contract of true love .
Kill me tomorrow , let me live tonight !
He came too late .
And thou must make a dullard of the world , If they not thought the profits of my death Were very pregnant and potential spirits To make thee seek it." O strange and fastened villain !
Soft , sir !
This house is little .
I prithee , pretty youth , let me be better acquainted with thee .
And , gentle friends , Let's kill him boldly but not wrathfully .
He hath a heart as sound as a bell , and his tongue is the clapper , for what his heart thinks , his tongue speaks .
Is Clarence dead ?
No , faith , lords and great men will not let me .
It is not moonlight now .
We will proceed no further in this business .
They that reap must sheaf and bind , Then to cart with Rosalind .
Oh , then belike she was old and gentle , and you rode , like a kern of Ireland , your French hose off and in your straight strossers .
God give me joy to wear it , for my heart is exceeding heavy .
It may be , very like .
Come with a thought .
Then pleaded I for you .
I know they are in Rome together Looking for Antony .
Love news , in faith ?
There's no doubt his majesty Will soon recover his accustomed health .
What do you call the play ?
Did not you tell me I should know the man By the Athenian garment he had on ?
What would you say to me now , an I were your very , very Rosalind ?
I have none .
That methinks is strange .
Ay , my good lord .
And now , I pray you , sir , For still 'tis beating in my mind , your reason For raising this sea storm ?
We'll see 'em starve first .
She is thine own. , What , Ariel !
My Lord of Cambridge , and my kind Lord of Masham , And you , my gentle knight , give me your thoughts .
I hid me under the dead mooncalf's gaberdine for fear of the storm .

Therefore , dear Isis , keep decorum , and fortune him accordingly .
Let us now stay and see it .
Room for Antony , most noble Antony !
I say "thy husband" , dost understand the word ?
My master will be here ere morning .
Not a whit , Touchstone .

Think not I love him , though I ask for him .
They'll mar my counterfeiting .
Let me lick thy shoe .
What dost thou know me for ?
No , that you shall not till you take her hand Before this friar and swear to marry her .
Why , right , you are in the right .
My clerk hath some good comforts too for you .
What , in my sight ? , Bianca , get thee in .
You speak to Casca , and to such a man That is no fleering telltale .
For I am almost ready to dissolve , Hearing of this .
I said so , dear Katherine ; and I must not blush to affirm it .
Monster , your fairy , which you say is a harmless fairy , has done little better than played the jack with us .
Do , young sir .
And can you by no drift of conference Get from him why he puts on this confusion , Grating so harshly all his days of quiet With turbulent and dangerous lunacy ?
If love have touched you , naught remains but so : Gramercies , lad , go forward .
I shall be pinched to death .
She was false as water .
Abhor it , fear it , do not enter it .
I humbly thank your ladyship .
Welcome , wanderer .
Let's stab ourselves .
Belike 'tis but a rumor .

Well struck !
Good morrow , masters .
Canst thou , when thou command'st the beggar's knee , Command the health of it ?
Fie , how impatience loureth in your face .
Bespeak him a fortnight before. , I will have the heart of him if he forfeit , for were he out of Venice I can make what merchandise I will. , Go , go , Tubal , and meet me at our synagogue .
I'll warrant him for drowning though the ship were no stronger than a nutshell and as leaky as an unstanched wench .
Who talks within there ?
Go to him , madam , speak to him .
He hath no friends but who are friends for fear .
I say you are not .
Yet could I bear that too , well , very well .
Counterfeit ?
I am the son of Marcus Cato , ho !
Let be .
Tis a vile thing to die , my gracious lord , When men are unprepared and look not for it .
Art thou indeed ?
Macbeth Is ripe for shaking , and the powers above Put on their instruments .
As from a bear a man would run for life , So fly I from her that would be my wife .
That did I never hear .

Well shone , Moon ! , Truly , the moon shines with a good grace .
What players are they ?
Though Nature hath given us wit to flout at Fortune , hath not Fortune sent in this fool to cut off the argument ?
Is this a prologue or the posy of a ring ?
Ha !
A maiden never bold , Of spirit so still and quiet that her motion Blushed at herself .
Though I look old , yet I am strong and lusty , For in my youth I never did apply Hot and rebellious liquors in my blood Nor did not with unbashful forehead woo The means of weakness and debility .
For me , I'll not be gone till I please myself .
My husband say that she was false !
Poisoned , then .
I will , my liege .
For us , we will resign During the life of this old majesty To him our absolute power .
You taught me first to beg , and now methinks You teach me how a beggar should be answered .
You !
Give me your hand .
What fool is this ?
One of them showed me a ring that he had of your daughter for a monkey .
Madam , with much ado .
I am heartily glad I came hither to you .
What news ?
O God , Horatio , what a wounded name , Things standing thus unknown , shall live behind me !
And tell me now , sweet friend , what happy gale Blows you to Padua here from old Verona ?
Seest thou here , This is the mouth o ' th ' cell .
Upon my life , she finds , although I can not , Myself to be a marv'lous proper man .
Hoyday , a riddle !
I pray you , tell it .
and but I be deceived , Signior Baptista may remember me , Near twenty years ago , in Genoa , Where we were lodgers at the Pegasus .
O perdurable shame !
It is the rival of my love .
I come not , friends , to steal away your hearts .
My will , not all the world .
Send Thy token of reprieve .
Tis with cares .
Lady , were you her bedfellow last night ?
And he is a very paramour for a sweet voice .
Please it your Grace lead on ?

Good old knight , Collect them all together at my tent .

They , for their truth , might better wear their heads Than some that have accused them wear their hats .
And I , my royal sovereign .
I will not choose what many men desire Because I will not jump with common spirits And rank me with the barbarous multitudes .
When I know the gentleman , I'll tell him what you say .
Why , sir , I gave the money for the rope .
Surely , a princely testimony , a goodly count , Count Comfect , a sweet gallant , surely !
What many men desire" , that "many" may be meant By the fool multitude that choose by show , Not learning more than the fond eye doth teach ; Which pries not to th ' interior , but like the martlet Builds in the weather on the outward wall , Even in the force and road of casualty .
My soul is heavy , and I fain would sleep .
Who's there ?
Poor Tom hath been scared out of his good wits .
I can swim like a duck , I'll be sworn .
Whither away ?
Something he left imperfect in the state which , since his coming forth , is thought of ; which imports to the kingdom so much fear and danger that his personal return was most required and necessary .
I do beseech you .
My lord is not my lord , nor should I know him Were he in favor as in humor altered .
Make assay .
Good lads , how do you both ?
Although I hate her , I'll not harm her so .
One speech in it I chiefly loved .
Your rye-straw hats put on , And these fresh nymphs encounter every one In country footing .
They say , one Taurus .
What say you ?
Right , I mean you .
Thou didst promise To bate me a full year .
Ride , ride , Messala , ride , and give these bills Unto the legions on the other side .
Prithee , be not angry .
He'll but break a comparison or two on me , which , peradventure not marked or not laughed at , strikes him into melancholy , and then there's a partridge wing saved , for the fool will eat no supper that night .
I would have such a fellow whipped for o'erdoing Termagant .
I desire you of more acquaintance , good Master Mustardseed .
But life itself , my wife , and all the world Are not with me esteemed above thy life .
Farewell , thou lob of spirits .
Oh , but she is wise .
Happy , in that we are not overhappy .
O Kate , content thee .
A touch , a touch , I do confess 't .
You have lost no reputation at all unless you repute yourself such a loser .
Thy thoughts I cleave to .
Sister , where thou ?
O , know , my name is lost .
Yea , the same .
An't please your Honor , players That offer service to your Lordship .
Who ever knew the heavens menace so ?
Farewell , my Desdemona .
O , sir , upon her nose , all o'er-embellished with rubies , carbuncles , sapphires , declining their rich aspect to the hot breath of Spain , who sent whole armadas of caracks to be ballast at her nose .
I'll mark the play .
Oh , lay me by my mistress ' side .
Lie , With her ?
I came hither to tell you ; and , circumstances shortened , for she has been too long a-talking of , the lady is disloyal .
I am not made of stones , But penetrable to your kind entreaties , Albeit against my conscience and my soul .
Nay , like enough , for I stay dinner there .
By this light , a most perfidious and drunken monster .
Where should they be set else ?
Let it work , For 'tis the sport to have the engineer Hoist with his own petard .
Return with her ?
Fare you well , Jessica .
See , and then speak yourselves .
The soldier's pole is fall'n !
Poor prattler , how thou talk'st !
My lord , Mark Antony , Hearing that you prepared for war , acquainted My grieved ear withal , whereon I begged His pardon for return .
Take up the body .
But for the stuffing , well , we are all mortal .
We'll hear it , Antony .
He that plays the king shall be welcome .
A wandering knight ?
I will plague them all , Even to roaring .
You a man ?
Even he that makes her queen .
Give him a present .
How goes the world , sir , now ?
You shall have wine enough , my lord , anon .
Live , live !
Make your best use of this .
If they have done this deed , my noble lord , If ?
Dismiss me .
And you .
Your Honor wins bad humors .
You are rather point-device in your accouterments , as loving yourself than seeming the lover of any other .
Therefore , most gracious duke , with thy command Let him be brought forth and borne hence for help .
Tis he that sends us to destroy you here .
Toward Peloponnesus are they fled .
Gone she is .
Towards Chertsey , noble lord ?
By my life I do , which I tender dearly , though I say I am a magician .
There is no other shelter hereabouts .
Marry , that can Hero !
Once more unto the breach , dear friends , once more , Or close the wall up with our English dead !
Abominable villain !
Wo , ha , ho !
My Lord of Norfolk , Here , most gracious liege .
A pleasing cordial , princely Buckingham , Is this thy vow unto my sickly heart .
I am sure he is in the fleet .
Call my guard , I prithee .
Away , away , for he is coming hither !
There's matter in 't indeed , if he be angry .
I understand moreover , upon the Rialto , he hath a third at Mexico , a fourth for England , and other ventures he hath squandered abroad .
Thine , Claudio , thine , I say .
Tide life , tide death , I come without delay .
They that stand high have many blasts to shake them , And if they fall , they dash themselves to pieces .
I know not why he comes .
See how yon justice rails upon yon simple thief .
Hortensio , to what end are all these words ?
Why grow the branches when the root is gone ?
Then bid adieu to me , and say the tears Belong to Egypt .
Is it new and old too ?
If it might please you to enforce no further The griefs between ye , to forget them quite Were to remember that the present need Speaks to atone you .
His own unkindness That stripped her from his benediction turned her To foreign casualties , gave her dear rights To his dog-hearted daughters .

Malcolm !
I am stuffed , cousin .
Shall I be tempted of the devil thus ?
It hath made me mad .
Rogue , thou hast lived too long .
How may the Duke be therewith satisfied , Whose messengers are here about my side Upon some present business of the state To bring me to him ?
We'll beat 'em into bench-holes .
But let me hear the letter of your friend .
Oh , that's well said , the chair !
Why are you drawn ?
Alas , alas !
No watch ?
Whereon I do beseech thee , grant me this , To leave me but a little to myself .
What countryman ?
But tell us , do you hear whether Antonio have had any loss at sea or no ?
You swore to me when I did give it you That you would wear it till your hour of death , And that it should lie with you in your grave .
Why , how now , Dromio .
Is that any thing now ?
Indeed , I am no mourner for that news , Because they have been still my adversaries .
Why , how now , daughter Katherine ?
Tis a fearful odds .
If a man's brains were in 's heels , were 't not in danger of kibes ?
O , no !
This is my treasurer .
O heavy deed !
His flight was madness .
Farewell .
And so he goes to heaven .
A fine woman !
Nay , the dust Should have ascended to the roof of heaven , Raised by your populous troops .
Why , how now , Hecate !
Lurk , lurk .
The hand of death hath raught him .
Tis a good hearing when children are toward .
My lord , I did intend it .
My deeds upon my head .
I'll able 'em .
What are they that do play it ?
Upon mine honor , Myself , my brother , and this grieved count Did see her , hear her , at that hour last night Talk with a ruffian at her chamber window Who hath indeed , most like a liberal villain , Confessed the vile encounters they have had A thousand times in secret .
Most learned judge , a sentence !
Pardon me , dear Rosalind .
How appears the fight ?
Why , after I have cut the egg i ' th ' middle and eat up the meat , the two crowns of the egg .
Very well mended .
Up and down , up and down , I will lead them up and down .
Bear welcome in your eye , Your hand , your tongue .
She confesses it .
O , give me leave .
Are you a man ?
Sirrah young gamester , your father were a fool To give thee all and in his waning age Set foot under thy table .
Most reverend signior , do you know my voice ?
Sir , speed you .
The children live whose fathers thou hast slaughtered , Ungoverned youth , to wail it in their age ; The parents live whose children thou hast butchered , Old barren plants , to wail it with their age .
Simple , plain Clarence , I do love thee so That I will shortly send thy soul to heaven , If heaven will take the present at our hands .
God will revenge it .
We look for you tomorrow .
Pluck but his name out of his heart and turn him going .
Ay , that he was .
But let me to my fortune and the caskets .
Did not her kitchen maid rail , taunt , and scorn me ?
You'll have your nephews neigh to you .
But lest myself be guilty to self wrong , I'll stop mine ears against the mermaid's song .
Bring me to Octavius .
What man was he talked with you yesternight Out at your window betwixt twelve and one ?
O , fie , fie , fie !
She died , my lord , but whiles her slander lived .
A messenger from the galleys .
My lord Sebastian , The truth you speak doth lack some gentleness And time to speak it in .
You are welcome , sir , to Cyprus .
O Bottom , thou art changed !
Farewell , father .
Only I here importune death awhile , until Of many thousand kisses the poor last I lay upon thy lips .
Question : why , an hour in clamor and a quarter in rheum .
Such a one Am I to fear , or none .
Meantime , have patience .
Almost at odds with morning , which is which .
But thine doth fry .
He shall stay my leisure .
Then heaven Have mercy on me !
O God !
Oh , that woman that can not make her fault her husband's occasion , let her never nurse her child herself , for she will breed it like a fool .
Do we all holy rites .
Say our pleasure , To such whose place is under us , requires Our quick remove from hence .
I prithee let me hear it .
To tell you where he lodges is to tell you where I lie .
Some that will evermore peep through their eyes And laugh like parrots at a bagpiper , And other of such vinegar aspect That they'll not show their teeth in way of smile Though Nestor swear the jest be laughable .
Look , when I vow , I weep .
We learn no other but the confident tyrant Keeps still in Dunsinane and will endure Our setting down before 't .
Show me , my women , like a queen .
but you see my finger Hath not the ring upon it .
Methinks thy voice is altered , and thou speak'st In better phrase and matter than thou didst .
Is that true ?
Then tell me If this might be a brother .
What will you do ?
I know into what straits of fortune she is driven , and it is not impossible to me , if it appear not inconvenient to you , to set her before your eyes tomorrow , human as she is , and without any danger .
You shall not go , my lord .
Whither are they vanished ?
But it is no English treason to cut French crowns , and tomorrow the king himself will be a clipper .
Lay forth the gown .
Do not presume too much upon my love .
Come not in here , nuncle .
Tis fit we understand them .
It wearies me ; you say it wearies you .
Prithee bear some charity to my wit .
Come , sit , sit , and a song .
It is shaped , sir , like itself , and it is as broad as it hath breadth .
Arm , arm , my lord .
Beg another of thy daughters .
Comes his army on ?
I'll not trust your word .
Truly , sir , all that I live by is with the awl .
I have known when there was no music with him but the drum and the fife , and now had he rather hear the tabor and the pipe .
What would you ?
What is your pleasure ?
Well , well , away .
If you do love me you will find me out. , Nerissa and the rest , stand all aloof .
He calls me "boy" and chides as he had power To beat me out of Egypt .
Traverse , go , provide thy money .
What's the matter , dear ?
Regan , I have good hope Thou didst not know on 't. , Who comes here ?
What ho , Horatio !
I could not for my heart deny it him .
Went'st not thou to her for a purse of ducats ?
God's bodykins , man , much better .
Hero itself can blot out Hero's virtue .
You can do better yet , but this is meetly .
Therefore tremble and depart .
Then you live about her waist , or in the middle of her favors ?
I call them forth to credit her .
Well , well , We shall thrive now. , Seest thou , my good fellow ?
Let life be short , else shame will be too long .
Repent that e'er thy tongue Hath so betrayed thine act .
And they are gone .
Wherefore ?
Never make denial .
We shall , my lord , Perform what you command us .
To save her life , I'll say she is not so .
What , would you make me mad ?
The noblest deer hath them as huge as the rascal .
There was blow for blow .
And I pray God grant them a fair departure .
Made she no verbal question ?
Servant-monster" ?
I know 't , my sister's .
I know him ; he wears a lock .
Ay , sweet Rosalind .
You see how full of changes his age is .
Unreal mockery , hence !
Is not this man jealous ?
So much was his pleasure should be proclaimed .
We must follow the leaders .
I see the jewel best enameled Will lose his beauty .
The gods are just , and of our pleasant vices Make instruments to plague us .
Speak to me home .
Give me some ink and paper .
What a pied ninny's this ! , Thou scurvy patch ! , I do beseech thy greatness , give him blows And take his bottle from him .
Forbear me .
Hath not a Jew hands , organs , dimensions , senses , affections , passions ?
About the wood go swifter than the wind , And Helena of Athens look thou find , All fancy-sick she is and pale of cheer , With sighs of love , that costs the fresh blood dear .
Take him up gently , and to bed with him , And each one to his office when he wakes .
Thou may 'st revenge , O slave !
His grace hath made the match , and all grace say "Amen" to it .
If I should take a displeasure against you , look you , Thou wert but a lost monster .
Not I , my lord .
How say you by this change ?
Go to , farewell .
That very hour , and in the selfsame inn , A meaner woman was delivered Of such a burden , male twins , both alike .
For God's sake , a pot of small ale .
Madam , so thrive I in my enterprise And dangerous success of bloody wars As I intend more good to you and yours Than ever you or yours were by me harmed !
Who is next ?
Some blessed power deliver us from hence !
He was furnished like a hunter .
The wife of Antony Should have an army for an usher and The neighs of horse to tell of her approach Long ere she did appear .
Bids the winds blow the earth into the sea Or swell the curled water 'bove the main , That things might change or cease .
I humbly thank you , sir .
Good , good , the justice of it pleases !
In nothing am I changed But in my garments .
Why , fare thee well , King .
Therein the patient Must minister to himself .
The usurer hangs the cozener .
Now I feed myself With most delicious poison .
Where is Montjoy the herald ?
It is not seen enough ; you should wear it in your cap .
Tis a wonder , by your leave , she will be tamed so .
Come , bring me unto my chance .
Tell me , Othello .
With news the time's with labor , and throws forth Each minute some .
Well , sir , get you in .
Be thou my witness that against my will , As Pompey was , am I compelled to set Upon one battle all our liberties .
Faith , once or twice she heaved the name of "father" Pantingly forth as if it pressed her heart , Cried , "Sisters , sisters !
What you have spoke , it may be so perchance .
Therefore speak no more .
My sword is drawn .
Mine ear , I thank it , brought me to thy sound But why unkindly didst thou leave me so ?
Soldiers , sir .
He , he , 'tis he .
Yes , faith , will I , Fridays and Saturdays and all .
Be not afraid , though you do see me weaponed .
But though my cates be mean , take them in good part .
Oh , my soul's joy !
Haply a woman's voice may do some good , When articles too nicely urged be stood on .
This is most certain that I shall deliver : Mark Antony is every hour in Rome Expected .
Is the king dead , the empire unpossessed ?
Now boast thee , Death , in thy possession lies A lass unparalleled .
Caesar speaks .
Whither is he going ?
He taught me how to know a man in love , in which cage of rushes I am sure you are not prisoner .
Two of them have the very bent of honor , And if their wisdoms be misled in this , The practice of it lives in John the Bastard , Whose spirits toil in frame of villainies .
Another hit .
The main descry Stands in the hourly thought .
Tooth that poisons if it bite , Mastiff , greyhound , mongrel grim ,
What , thou ?
My niece Plantagenet Led in the hand of her kind aunt of Gloucester ?
No , to their lives ill friends were contrary .
Is he not a most profane and liberal counselor ?
Why , this that I speak of .
Take him for all in all .
From this time Such I account thy love .
Come , Casca , you and I will yet ere day See Brutus at his house .
When we are born , we cry that we are come To this great stage of fools .
Under a compelling occasion , let women die .
No , let the candied tongue lick absurd pomp , And crook the pregnant hinges of the knee Where thrift may follow fawning .
Why , get you gone !
Set on , and leave no ceremony out .
And now about the cauldron sing , Like elves and fairies in a ring , Enchanting all that you put in .
In most profound earnest , and , I'll warrant you , for the love of Beatrice .
Beware Of entrance to a quarrel , but being in , Bear 't that th ' opposed may beware of thee .
Pale or red ?
O , they did urge it still unto the king .
He is arrived .
That were a kind of bastard hope indeed .
Let him come , and kindly .
I now perceive it was not altogether your brother's evil disposition made him seek his death , but a provoking merit set awork by a reprovable badness in himself .
Hang up thy mistress !
I'll come to thee straight .
I thank thee .
But it would better fit your honor to change your mind .
For murder , though it have no tongue , will speak With most miraculous organ .
Dromio , go bid the servants spread for dinner .
And , hark !
Better thou Hadst not been born than not t ' have pleased me better .
I do begin to have bloody thoughts .
One ever near thee .
Where's the king ?
Use lenity , sweet chuck .
No , it is Casca , one incorporate To our attempts .
Is there any cause in nature that makes these hard hearts ?
I did hear him groan , Ay , and that tongue of his that bade the Romans Mark him and write his speeches in their books , "Alas , " it cried , "give me some drink , Titinius , " As a sick girl .
A crow without feather ?
Jove , Jove , this shepherd's passion Is much upon my fashion .
Would it not make one weep ?
Had he his hurts before ?
But few of any sort , and none of name .
Godden to your Worship , good Captain James .
Longer , longer .
I do not think thou canst , for then thou wast not Out three years old .
Herein I see thou lov'st me not with the full weight that I love thee .
Is not that strange ?
At first the infant , Mewling and puking in the nurse's arms .
Come the next sabbath , and I will content you .
I have done my work ill , friends .
Ay , my lord .
I call thee not .
Why , Belman is as good as he , my lord .
Good dawning to thee , friend .
I thank thee for that jest .
You may gather more .
He is afeard to come .
Upon mine honor , sir , I heard a humming , And that a strange one too , which did awake me .
With all my heart. , Some three or four of you Go give him courteous conduct to this place. , Meantime the court shall hear Bellario's letter .
What , must I hold a candle to my shames ?
Oh , let their bodies follow , my dear liege , With blood and sword and fire to win your right , In aid whereof we of the spiritualty Will raise your Highness such a mighty sum As never did the clergy at one time Bring in to any of your ancestors .
Bate , I beseech you , widow Dido .
Oh , there has been much throwing about of brains .
Nay , that's not your way .
Unmerciful lady as you are , I'm none .
Let him alone , for I remember now How he's employed .
O , in the battle think on Buckingham , And die in terror of thy guiltiness .
Is this true ?
Good sir , to the purpose .
Rage , blow !
But , look you , Cassius , The angry spot doth glow on Caesar's brow , And all the rest look like a chidden train .
Without , my lord ; guarded , to know your pleasure .
Adieu .
Speak !
Nay , she is worse ; she is the devil's dam , and here she comes in the habit of a light wench .
Uncharitably with me have you dealt , And shamefully my hopes by you are butchered .
Go we to him .
Invest me in my motley .
But for his purpose in the coronation , I have not sounded him , nor he delivered His gracious pleasure any way therein .
Cambio .
Why , then , tomorrow night , or Tuesday morn .
Where hast thou been , sister ?
I do believe 'twas he .
Thy business ?
I am thus bold to put your Grace in mind Of what you promised me .
You must note beside , That we have tried the utmost of our friends , Our legions are brim-full , our cause is ripe .
Fore heaven , they have given me a rouse already .
Thou art too like the spirit of Banquo .
Pray heavens he be , For I have served him , and the man commands Like a full soldier .
O valiant cousin !
By my troth , a pleasant-spirited lady .
Sir , fare you well .
With all my heart , and it doth much content me To hear him so inclined .
A charge we bear i' th' war , And as the president of my kingdom will Appear there for a man .
But you are no such man .
God give him joy !
For every minute is expectancy Of more arrivance .
Where is thy leather apron and thy rule ?
Thou shalt find That I'll resume the shape which thou dost think I have cast off for ever .
But what , is Catesby gone ?
Because that , like a jack , thou keep'st the stroke Betwixt thy begging and my meditation .
We have not spoke us yet of torchbearers .
He did comply , sir , with his dug before he sucked it .
Therefore be deaf to my unpitied folly , And all the gods go with you !
Leave her to heaven And to those thorns that in her bosom lodge To prick and sting her .
I promise you I scarcely know myself .
But I will punish home .
Friends to this ground .
Oh , I followed that I blush to look upon !
What in the contrary ?
Where is my lord of Gloucester ?
Whether he was combined With those of Norway , or did line the rebel With hidden help and vantage , or that with both He labored in his country's wrack , I know not ; But treasons capital , confessed and proved , Have overthrown him .
Let but the commons hear this testament , Which , pardon me , I do not mean to read , And they would go and kiss dead Caesar's wounds And dip their napkins in his sacred blood , Yea , beg a hair of him for memory , And , dying , mention it within their wills , Bequeathing it as a rich legacy Unto their issue .
He can not speak , my lord .
You have forgot the will I told you of .
When beggars die there are no comets seen .
All that I have to say is to tell you that the lanthorn is the moon ; I , the man in the moon ; this thornbush , my thornbush ; and this dog , my dog .
Harder , harder .
We thank your Honor .
I can no more .
You may , sir .
Give me my principal , and let me go .
They have dispatched with Pompey ; he is gone .
Help me hence , ho !
O soft , sir !
A sweet woman !
Hang not on my garments .
Some officers take them away .
Farewell .
Where's the king ?
The rest march on with me .
Come , wait upon him .
Let sorrow split my heart if ever I Did hate thee or thy father .
For your desire to know what is between us , O'ermaster 't as you may .
Goblin , lead them up and down .
O , let me kiss that hand !
Here comes a messenger .
Heigh-ho .
A tomb Must cover thy sweet eyes .
Pat , pat .
Not dead ?
That they were , I wish Myself were mudded in that oozy bed Where my son lies. , When did you lose your daughter ?
My duty to you both , on equal love , Great kings of France and England .
But thou'rt too much my friend , And I'll not wish thee to her .
Who's there ?
Pray thee , go seek him , and bring him to my tent .
I will discharge it in either your straw-color beard , your orange-tawny beard , your purple-in-grain beard , or your French crown-color beard , your perfect yellow .
Was he not here ?
Sir , are not you my father ?
And I was going to your lodging , Cassio .
Pardon , master .
Amen .
I dreamt there was an emperor Antony .
Never .
Your graces are right welcome .
Oh , behold , The riches of the ship is come on shore !
Patience unmoved !
If so , be patient , sister .
My villainy they have upon record , which I had rather seal with my death than repeat over to my shame .
Yare , yare , good Iras , quick .
The evil that men do lives after them ; The good is oft interred with their bones .
With anger , with sickness , or with hunger , my lord , not with love .
For any good That I myself have done unto myself ?
Softly and swiftly , sir , for the priest is ready .
Dost grant me , hedgehog ?
All may be well enough .
What prisoners of good sort are taken , uncle ?
O Hamlet , what a falling off was there !
We will yet do well .
Is he married ?
Alack , why thus ?
Marry , patience , Or I shall say you are all in all in spleen , And nothing of a man .
What's the matter ?
Bear with him , Brutus .
Therefore prepare thee to cut off the flesh .
Why should their liberty than ours be more ?
O villain !
He dreams .
Avaunt !
You have displaced the mirth , broke the good meeting , With most admired disorder .
Are we all ready ?
Alone , it was the subject of my theme ; In company I often glanced it .
Though all things foul would wear the brows of grace , Yet grace must still look so .
But till that time Come not thou near me .
Three in Egypt Can not make better note .
And a chain , that you once wore , about his neck .
Good repose the while !
Stones have been known to move , and trees to speak .
I am sure he had more hair of his tail than I have of my face when I last saw him .
Thou shalt not live , That I may tell pale-hearted fear it lies , And sleep in spite of thunder .
What , bear her in hand until they come to take hands and then , with public accusation , uncovered slander , unmitigated rancor , O God , that I were a man !
Be patient , gentlemen .
What are you ?
Well , I have done .
Caesar sends greeting to the Queen of Egypt , And bids thee study on what fair demands Thou mean'st to have him grant thee .
Happily he's the second time come to them , for they say an old man is twice a child .
And from thy hated presence part I so .
I found not Cassio's kisses on her lips .
Had I but died an hour before this chance , I had lived a blessed time , for from this instant There's nothing serious in mortality .
You look wearily .
Or does he walk ?
What two crowns shall they be ?
To tell you true , I counterfeit him .
His folly , Helena , is no fault of mine .
Ere I learn love , I'll practice to obey .
Even he , sir .
Gracious England hath Lent us good Siward and ten thousand men ; An older and a better soldier none That Christendom gives out .
Fare thee well .
Being unprepared , Our will became the servant to defect , Which else should free have wrought .
Companion , hence !
Plots have I laid , inductions dangerous , By drunken prophecies , libels and dreams , To set my brother Clarence and the king In deadly hate , the one against the other ; And if King Edward be as true and just As I am subtle , false , and treacherous , This day should Clarence closely be mewed up About a prophecy which says that "G" Of Edward's heirs the murderer shall be .
Happiest of all is that her gentle spirit Commits itself to yours to be directed As from her lord , her governor , her king .
I know thou canst not choose .
Ay , every inch a king .
Let Lucius and Titinius guard our door .
Peace , you dull fool .
Prithee , no more .
No , Cassio is not killed .
I tell thee , churlish priest , A ministering angel shall my sister be When thou liest howling .
It is not meet you know how Caesar loved you .
If but as well I other accents borrow , That can my speech diffuse , my good intent May carry through itself to that full issue For which I razed my likeness .
Shall I go fetch your nightgown ?
When have I injured thee ?
I can behold no longer .
Oh , villain !
This was the noblest Roman of them all .
Feed and regard him not .
Are not these woods More free from peril than the envious court ?
His soldiership Is twice the other twain .
Hark , hark !
So young , my lord , and true .
Therefore weep .
He stays upon your will .
See where they come .
Cassius , be constant .
But what of Cicero ?
Go .
Nay , but he prated And spoke such scurvy and provoking terms Against your honor That , with the little godliness I have , I did full hard forbear him .
Ay , if the fool could find it where it lies .
When Roscius was an actor in Rome , The actors are come hither , my lord .
Lucius , who's that knocking ?
Bid her have good heart .
What is a traitor ?
Light !
If you will come to me , For now I spy a danger , I entreat you To bring but five and twenty .
Awake , sir , awake .
I think of as many matters as he , but I give heaven thanks and make no boast of them .
Then be 't so , my good lord. , How does the king ?
Ay , madam , it is common .
Would I had two coxcombs and two daughters .
I'll tell thee more of this another time .
The one of them contains my picture , Prince .
My lord , whoever journeys to the prince , For God's sake let not us two at home .
No , sir .
He is my prisoner , and you shall not have him .
is 't not perfect conscience To quit him with this arm ?
You may think I love you not .
And she goes down at twelve .
This quarry cries on havoc .
I go .
Upon the platform , 'twixt eleven and twelve , I'll visit you .
And let no man abide this deed But we the doers .
She soon shall know of us , by some of ours , How honorable and how kindly we Determine for her , for Caesar can not live To be ungentle .
If thou beest Stephano , touch me and speak to me .
Then call we this the field of Agincourt , Fought on the day of Crispin Crispianus .
It struck mine ear most terribly .
Here is better than the open air .
I am dying , Egypt , dying .
He thinks he still is at his instrument .
Here he comes , and the Scots captain , Captain Jamy , with him .
How say you now ?
Welcome home , Grumio .
I know you are of her bosom .
O , my lord , You said that idle weeds are fast in growth .
For Brutus , as you know , was Caesar's angel .
Nor I .
And we , like friends , will straightway go together .
It was some fiend .
All the power of his wits have given way to his impatience .
Where's that mongrel ?
Demetrius loves her , and he loves not you .
Who can control his fate ?
Are they "informed" of this ?
First , rehearse your song by rote , To each word a warbling note .
I never heard a passion so confused , So strange , outrageous , and so variable , As the dog Jew did utter in the streets .
From our brother England ?
You may do then in time .
Then must thou needs find out new heaven , new earth .
I must be gone .
Is 't not enough , is 't not enough , young man , That I did never , no , nor never can , Deserve a sweet look from Demetrius ' eye , But you must flout my insufficiency ?
Go , coward as thou art .
That will I .
Killing swine .
Thou shalt be lord of it and I'll serve thee .
Go to , carry this .
I might have saved her .
I come to bury Caesar , not to praise him .
You were best go in .
This deed I'll do before this purpose cool .
There's a bargain made .
The British powers are marching hitherward .
In faith , my hand meant nothing to my sword .
Nor rain , wind , thunder , fire are my daughters .
What horrible fancy's this ?
Nay , I am sure it is , Volumnius .
That you should here repent you , The actors are at hand , and by their show You shall know all that you are like to know .
No , but to the gate , and there will the devil meet me like an old cuckold with horns on his head , and say , "Get you to heaven , Beatrice , get you to heaven ; here's no place for you maids." So deliver I up my apes and away to Saint Peter .
When Jacob grazed his uncle Laban's sheep , This Jacob from our holy Abram was , As his wise mother wrought in his behalf , The third possessor , ay , he was the third , And what of him ?
Come , come .
When they do choose , They have the wisdom by their wit to lose .
Now he begins the story .
But I will tell you at some meeter season .
The ingratitude of this Seleucus does Even make me wild .
He hath , my lord .
The wisdom of your duty , fair Bianca , Hath cost me an hundred crowns since suppertime .
Give me particulars .
And yet to win her , all the world to nothing !
And so she did .
Now , Roderigo , Where didst thou see her ? , Oh , unhappy girl ! , With the Moor , say'st thou ? , Who would be a father ? , How didst thou know 'twas she ? , Oh , she deceives me Past thought ! , What said she to you ? , Get more tapers , Raise all my kindred .
But in my terms of honor I stand aloof , and will no reconcilement Till by some elder masters , of known honor , I have a voice and precedent of peace To keep my name ungored .
My lord , his majesty bade me signify to you that he has laid a great wager on your head .
Swear by my sword .
Nor none that live , I hope .
Turn the sands into eloquent tongues , and my horse is argument for them all .
I speak but in the figures and comparisons of it .
I understand not what you mean by this .
At land indeed Thou dost o'ercount me of my father's house , But since the cuckoo builds not for himself , Remain in 't as thou mayst .
If such a one be fit to govern , speak .
That was in thy rage .
Thou wilt write to Antony ?
Every one .
Caesar's better parts Shall be crowned in Brutus !
In honored love .
And in the morn I'll bring you to your ship and so to Naples , Where I have hope to see the nuptial Of these our dear-beloved solemnized , And thence retire me to my Milan , where Every third thought shall be my grave .
I will have none on 't .
Very good !
Talkers are no good doers .
Then the whining schoolboy with his satchel And shining morning face , creeping like snail Unwillingly to school .
Hath not a Jew eyes ?
I'll in to counsel them .
You take my life When you do take the means whereby I live .
Lord Mayor , the reason we have sent , Look back !
Thou art a villain to impeach me thus .
Yea , by Mass , that it is .
When that the poor have cried , Caesar hath wept .
I charge you , as you hope to have redemption , By Christ's dear blood shed for our grievous sins , That you depart , and lay no hands on me .
And pluck the wings from painted butterflies To fan the moonbeams from his sleeping eyes .
What's the news ?
If she lives till doomsday , she'll burn a week longer than the whole world .
Shall I go win my daughter to thy will ?
I thank you , sir .
No , no , by God's good grace , his son shall reign .
There's comfort yet ; they are assailable .
What he will do with it Heaven knows , not I. I nothing but to please his fantasy .
Here's a night pities neither wise man nor fool .
My life is run his compass .
My lord ?
For you see , it is already in snuff .
What is "t o"clock ?
Five-and-twenty , sir .
I would he knew that I had saved his brother .
Scant not my cups , and make as much of me As when mine empire was your fellow too , And suffered my command .
Then , God grant me too Thou mayst be damned for that wicked deed .
We doubt not now But every rub is smoothed on our way .
By this scimitar That slew the Sophy and a Persian prince That won three fields of Sultan Solyman , I would o'erstare the sternest eyes that look , Outbrave the heart most daring on the earth , Pluck the young sucking cubs from the she-bear , Yea , mock the lion when he roars for prey , To win the lady .
Nor no man else .
They did , Fluellen .
Sayest thou so ?
What men may do !
Troth , my lord , I have played the part of Lady Fame .
Farewell .
Oh , that your frowns would teach my smiles such skill !
Follow the noise so far as we have quarter ; Let's see how it will give off .
My soul doth tell me Hero is belied , And that shall Claudio know ; so shall the Prince And all of them that thus dishonor her .
No , nor I neither , but most wonderful that she should so dote on Signor Benedick , whom she hath in all outward behaviors seemed ever to abhor .
Stephano !
Where is he ?
Hazard for lead ?
Whom thou wert sworn to cherish and defend .
Rise , and lend thine ear .
If every one knows us , and we know none , 'T is time , I think , to trudge , pack , and be gone .
Your betters , sir .
To no more Will I give place or notice .
Slay !
But it is certain I am loved of all ladies , only you excepted .
The gods withhold me !
I take 't 'tis later , sir .
I know not .
For , sir , It is as sure as you are Roderigo , Were I the Moor , I would not be Iago .
I doubt not but his friends will turn to us .
Give me your present to one Master Bassanio , who indeed gives rare new liveries .
Did you not speak to it ?
So , slave , hence !
What "quality" ?
Write from us to him .
How now , you dog ?
And squabble ?
And for three months .
All the pictures fairest lined Are but black to Rosalind .
I will not speak with her .
My mistress , dearest , and I thus humble ever .
I follow him to serve my turn upon him .
What ?
Thus hath the course of justice whirled about And left thee but a very prey to time , Having no more but thought of what thou wast To torture thee the more , being what thou art .
I know where I will wear this dagger then .
I can not hear of any that did see her .
Safe in a ditch he bides , With twenty trenched gashes on his head , The least a death to nature .
It is but trash .
You know I say nothing to him , for he understands not me , nor I him .
I had rather break mine own .
She Phoebes me .
Ay , gentle cousin , were it light enough .
I must employ you in some business Against our nuptial and confer with you Of something nearly that concerns yourselves .
How ?
He did , from first to last .
Why is Time such a niggard of hair , being , as it is , so plentiful an excrement ?
Do the boys carry it away ?
Grumio gave order how it should be done .
Thou dost not wish more help from England , coz ?
A fig !
And why , sir , must they so ?
Tis so , but Edward lives .
She shall be buried by her Antony .
Why , or for what , the nobles were committed Is all unknown to me , my gracious lord .
And , Kate , when France is mine and I am yours , then yours is France and you are mine .
Mend when thou canst .
Away , make haste .
Pray ye , go .
Then there were two cousins laid up , when the one should be lamed with reasons and the other mad without any .
Milan and Naples have More widows in them of this business ' making Than we bring men to comfort them .
Come you from old Bellario ?
If this be known , Cassius or Caesar never shall turn back , For I will slay myself .
The villain Jew with outcries raised the Duke , Who went with him to search Bassanio's ship .
I have within my mind A thousand raw tricks of these bragging jacks Which I will practice .
Tis well you offer it behind her back .
Inquire the Jew's house out .
I shall remember .
I will depart in quiet And , in despite of mirth , mean to be merry .
My mind was never yet more mercenary .
Shut that , and 'twill out at the keyhole .
To business that we love we rise betimes And go to 't with delight .
That's not the tune .
Too late , good Diomed .
Tell him I have moved my lord on his behalf , and hope all will be well .
I am weary of you .
Yes , one , and in this manner .
Your son and daughter found this trespass worth The shame which here it suffers .
I have neither the scholar's melancholy , which is emulation ; nor the musician's , which is fantastical ; nor the courtier's , which is proud ; nor the soldier's , which is ambitious ; nor the lawyer's , which is politic ; nor the lady's , which is nice ; nor the lover's , which is all these , but it is a melancholy of mine own , compounded of many simples , extracted from many objects , and indeed the sundry contemplation of my travels , in which my often rumination wraps me in a most humorous sadness .
The death of Antony Is not a single doom .
For your physicians have expressly charged , In peril to incur your former malady , That I should yet absent me from your bed .

He shall think , by the letters that thou wilt drop , that they come from my niece , and that she's in love with him .
I will help you to 't .
Well , Jove , not I , is the doer of this , and he is to be thanked .
An you part so , mistress , I would I might never draw sword again .
But , if you were the devil , you are fair .
I will construe to them whence you come .
I am not mad , Sir Topas .
An apple , cleft in two , is not more twin Than these two creatures .
Your lord does know my mind .
Sweet lady , ho , ho .
Who saw Cesario , ho ?
Marry , will I , sir .
Ay , but he will not now be pacified .
What think you of this fool , Malvolio ?
You lie .
I would not so much as make water but in a sink-a-pace .
Nay , I am for all waters .
You must needs yield your reason , Sir Andrew .
Hold , Toby !
Have you not set mine honor at the stake , And baited it with all the unmuzzled thoughts That tyrannous heart can think ?
Did you never see the picture of "We Three" ?
What meanest thou by that , Malvolio ?
The competitors enter .
To him , Sir Topas .
Why appear you with this ridiculous boldness before my lady ?
Most wonderful !
Well , I will be so much a sinner , to be a double-dealer .
Virtue that transgresses is but patched with sin , and sin that amends is but patched with virtue .
I say to you this house is dark .
Wilt thou go to bed , Malvolio ?
I may command where I adore." Why , she may command me .
Thou hadst need send for more money .
Who has done this , Sir Andrew ?
He has heard that word of some great man and now applies it to a fool .
Nay , then I must have an ounce or two of this malapert blood from you .
What's the matter ?
Fool !
Run after that same peevish messenger , The county's man .
If that be to care for nothing , sir , I would it would make you invisible .
But we are prevented .
Even so quickly may one catch the plague ?
I can write very like my lady your niece : on a forgotten matter we can hardly make distinction of our hands .
O , welcome , father !
I was adored once too .
Who are they ?
His indignation derives itself out of a very competent injury .
Lead me on .
What is the matter with thee ?
He shall enlarge him .
But what's your jest ?
How now , my hearts !
He named Sebastian .
A blank , my lord .
Thou shalt not be the worse for me : there's gold .
And now I do bethink me , it was she First told me thou wast mad , then camest in smiling , And in such forms which here were presupposed Upon thee in the letter .
Go to , you're a dry fool .
Scout me for him at the corner the orchard like a bum-baily .
My gentleman , Cesario ?
I dare lay any money 'twill be nothing yet .
I call thee by the most modest terms , for I am one of those gentle ones that will use the devil himself with courtesy .
It is no matter how witty , so it be eloquent and full of invention .
Farewell .
I will plant you two , and let the fool make a third , where he shall find the letter .
Wherefore , sweetheart ?
Oh , it came o'er my ear like the sweet sound , That breathes upon a bank of violets , Stealing and giving odor .
A lady , sir , though it was said she much resembled me , was yet of many accounted beautiful .
Give me excess of it that , surfeiting , The appetite may sicken , and so die .
My matter hath no voice , lady , but to your own most pregnant and vouchsafed ear .
A gentleman ?
Thou shalt not choose but go .
My duty hushes me .
Nay , I'll come .
Fare thee well .
Shall we not , Sir Andrew ?
I thank you for your pains .
I have many enemies in Orsino's court , Else would I very shortly see thee there .
We took him for a coward , but he's the very devil incardinate .
He's a coward and a coistrel that will not drink to my niece till his brains turn o ' th ' toe like a parish top .
A contagious breath .
And some have greatness thrust upon them." Heaven restore thee !
It is perchance that you yourself were saved .
Sebastian was my father ; Such a Sebastian was my brother too , So went he suited to his watery tomb .
What would you ?
Give me my veil .
Let me yet know of you whither you are bound .
Come thy ways , Signior Fabian .
I frown the while , and perchance wind up watch , or play with my , some rich jewel .
Give them way till he take leave , and presently after him .
Marry , sir , they praise me and make an ass of me , now my foes tell me plainly I am an ass .
Will either of you bear me a challenge to him ?
O , my poor brother !
So that by my foes , sir I profit in the knowledge of myself , and by my friends , I am abused .
Where is Malvolio ?
And they have been grand-jurymen since before Noah was a sailor .
Oh , 'twill be admirable !
From the Count Orsino , is it ?
Unless the master were the man .
What is his name ?
Still so constant , lord .
One face , one voice , one habit , and two persons !
I can hardly forbear hurling things at him .
Dear lad , believe it .
My lord and master loves you .
Tis my picture .
Why , what would you ?
Ay , he .
In what chapter of his bosom ?
Sir , no .
Ay , madam .
An your ladyship will have it as it ought to be , you must allow Prithee , read i ' thy right wits .
Thy reason , dear venom , give thy reason .
To the gates of Tartar , thou most excellent devil of wit !
Then you are mad indeed , if you be no better in your wits than a fool .
What is decreed must be , and be this so .
Your ladyship were best to have some guard about you if he come , for sure the man is tainted in 's wits .
I'll have an action of battery against him if there be any law in Illyria .
Good , good .
Why , sir , her name's a word , and to dally with that word might make my sister wanton .
Do not desire to see this letter .
Besides , she uses me with a more exalted respect than anyone else that follows her .
Of your complexion .
So that , conclusions to be as kisses , if your four negatives make your two affirmatives , why then the worse for my friends and the better for my foes .
Aha !
Are you ready , sir ?
Art thou a churchman ?
How say you to that , Malvolio ?
No , my profound heart .
And on the answer , he pays you as surely as your feet hit the ground they step on .
Ay , but I know , What dost thou know ?
Sad , lady !
What might you think ?
How have you made division of yourself ?
No , not a grize .
Believe me , I am not .
Thou'rt a scholar .
No , my lord , not I. Alas , it is the baseness of thy fear That makes thee strangle thy propriety .
But that it would be double-dealing , sir , I would you could make it another .
Here lies your way .
How now ?
Put them to motion .
Ay , my lord , this same .
O good Antonio , forgive me your trouble .
If Sir Toby would leave drinking , thou wert as witty a piece of Eve's flesh as any in Illyria .
No , sir , it is legs and thighs .
Will you hoist sail , sir ?
In faith , they are as true of heart as we .
To him in thine own voice , and bring me word how thou findest him .
This was a great argument of love in her toward you .
His dishonesty appears in leaving his friend here in necessity and denying him .
Smilest thou ?
O , if I thought that , I'd beat him like a dog !
I marvel your ladyship takes delight in such a barren rascal .
I will acquit you .
Were we not born under Taurus ?
I think it well , my lord .
There's another .
Never trust me , then .
I think you set nothing by a bloody coxcomb .
Most villanously , like a pedant that keeps a school i ' the church .
His very genius hath taken the infection of the device , man .
Good fool , help me to some light and some paper .
Thou shall present me as an eunuch to him .
He hath been most notoriously abused .
Go off .
With the same 'havior that your passion bears Goes on my master's grief .
Once more , Cesario , Get thee to yond same sovereign cruelty .
I will fetch you light , and paper , and ink .
Oh , I have read it .
Soft , soft !
Soft , here follows prose .
My name is Mary , sir .
On thy life I charge thee , hold !
No , I do not know you , nor I am not sent to you by my lady , to bid you come speak with her , nor your name is not Master Cesario , nor this is not my nose neither .
I forgive you the praise .
Oh , that record is lively in my soul !
I think his soul is in hell , madonna .
How can this be ?
Primo , secundo , tertio is a good play , and the old saying is , the third pays for all .
It shines everywhere .
Excellent good , i ' faith .
Were not you even now with the Countess Olivia ?
Sir Toby , madam , your kinsman .
If the heavens had been pleased , would we had so ended !
Faith , I'll home tomorrow , Sir Toby .
What is the opinion of Pythagoras concerning wildfowl ?
My life upon 't , young though thou art , thine eye Hath stay'd upon some favor that it loves .
Ay , madam , well , for I was bred and born Not three hours ' travel from this very place .
She made good view of me , indeed so much That sure methought her eyes had lost her tongue , For she did speak in starts distractedly .
True , madam .
For the love o ' God , peace !
I pray you , sir , what is he ?
O Lord !
Come to what is important in 't .
My determinate voyage is mere extravagancy .
No , sir , the worse .
I have heard her swear 't .
For they shall yet belie thy happy years That say thou art a man .
Madman , thou errest .
I should have given 't you today morning , but as a madman's epistles are no gospels , so it skills not much when they are delivered .
No , sir , no jot .
Very brief , and to exceeding good sense , less .
Let her hang me .
I will return again into the house and desire some conduct of the lady .
Here come the officers .
He is now in some commerce with my lady and will by and by depart .
No , faith , I'll not stay a jot longer .
Come , begin .
Have you no wit , manners , nor honesty but to gabble like tinkers at this time of night ?
An I do not , Come , let's see the event .
Good fool , some ink , paper , and light , and convey what I will set down to my lady .
I know my lady will strike him .
I'll follow this good man , and go with you ; And , having sworn truth , ever will be true .
Fool , I say !
Were you a woman , as the rest goes even , I should my tears let fall upon your cheek And say "Thrice-welcome , drowned Viola ! " My father had a mole upon his brow .
If all the devils of hell be drawn in little , and Legion himself possessed him , yet I'll speak to him .
By my troth , the fool has an excellent breast .
I have not seen such a firago .
Husband ?
There's one at the gate .
Know'st thou this country ?
I ' faith , or I either ?
I'll ride home tomorrow , Sir Toby .
And I beseech you come again tomorrow .
Ay , marry , what is he ?
He is sure possessed , madam .
If she do , he'll smile and take 't for a great favor .
If it be so , as 'tis , Poor lady , she were better love a dream .
One , sir , that for his love dares yet do more Than you have heard him brag to you he will .
So full of shapes is fancy That it alone is high fantastical .
Thy Fates open their hands .
How dost thou , my good fellow ?
Say that some lady , as perhaps there is , Hath for your love a great a pang of heart As you have for Olivia .
Let me be clear of thee .
Thou know'st not me .
Fortune forbid my outside have not charmed her !
They say he has been fencer to the Sophy .
I would be loath to cast away my speech , for besides that it is excellently well penned , I have taken great pains to con it .
Ass , I doubt not .
This is Illyria , lady .
Ourselves we do not owe .
He takes on him to understand so much , and therefore comes to speak with you .
Let me see the caper .
I can not love him .
Speak to me .
She is drowned already , sir , with salt water , though I seem to drown her remembrance again with more .
The more fool , madonna , to mourn for your brother's soul being in heaven .
Away with him .
Thou shalt hold the opinion of Pythagoras ere I will allow of thy wits , and fear to kill a woodcock lest thou dispossess the soul of thy grandam .
Belong you to the Lady Olivia , friends ?
I am a fellow o ' th ' strangest mind i ' th ' world .
Therefore perpend , my princess , and give ear .
Ay , Biddy , come with me. , What , man !
Marian , I say !
Here comes the man , sir , that did rescue me .
Cesario is your servant's name , fair princess .
Welcome , ass .
Methinks sometimes I have no more wit than a Christian or an ordinary man has .
Not black in my mind , though yellow in my legs .
As plain as I see you now .
Why , this is excellent .
If you will not murder me for my love , let me be your servant .
You should then have accosted her , and with some excellent jests , fire-new from the mint , you should have banged the youth into dumbness .
Here he is , here he is .
Save thee , friend , and thy music .
For women are as roses , whose fair flower Being once displayed , doth fall that very hour .
If thou entertainest my love , let it appear in thy smiling .
I'll ride your horse as well as I ride you .
Sweet Sir Andrew !
Then lead the way , good father ; and heavens so shine That they may fairly note this act of mine .
He'll speak with you , will you or no .
Excellent !
Is that the meaning of "accost" ?
Antonio , I arrest thee at the suit of Count Orsino .
It is the more like to be feigned .
Ay , good fool .
O , sir , I will not be so hard-hearted .
Orsino , this is that Antonio That took the And this is he that did the When your young nephew Titus lost his leg .
Twill endure wind and weather .
Who , Sir Andrew Aguecheek ?
Fabian can scarce hold him yonder .
You know , he brought me out o ' favor with my lady about a bear-baiting here .
Tis a fair young man , and well attended .
O knight , thou lackest a cup of canary .
I am no more mad than you are .
Nay , if you be an undertaker , I am for you .
Hob , nob , is his word .
No .
I would not have him miscarry for the half of my dowry .
Save you , gentleman .
M" , why , that begins my name .
Take the fool away .
I could be sad .
There is no woman's sides Can bide the beating of so strong a passion As love doth give my heart .
Nothing that is so is so .
Dexterously , good madonna .
A good knave .
My lady is within , sir .
I mean , to go , sir , to enter .
He speaks nothing but madman .
Dost thou live by thy tabour ?
I shall answer for her .
Ha ?
Open 't , and read it .
He has broke my head across and has given Sir Toby a bloody coxcomb too .
He sees thee not .
Do not then walk too open .
Lips , do not move ; No man must know."
I pray you , keep it in .
Before me , she's a good wench .
Oh , that I served that lady And might not be delivered to the world , Till I had made mine own occasion mellow , What my estate is .
This was looked for at your hand , and this was balked .
In Orsino's bosom .
In his bosom ?
Sir , I have not you by the hand .
Who of my people hold him in delay ?
It shall advantage thee more than ever the bearing of letter did .
Troth , sir , I can yield you none without words , and words are grown so false , I am loath to prove reason with them .
You are idle , shallow things .
Ay me , detested !
Farewell .
We did keep time , sir , in our catches .
You'll find it otherwise , I assure you .
Pardon me , sweet one , even for the vows We made each other but so late ago .
I can not be so answer'd .
Be that thou know'st thou art , and then thou art As great as that thou fear'st .
Which is Sebastian ?
What wilt thou do ?
Is 't possible ?
Let him approach .
The captain that did bring me first on shore Hath my maid's garments .
Will it be ever thus ?
An thou let part so , Sir Andrew , would thou mightst never draw sword again .
My lady has a white hand , and the Myrmidons are no bottle-ale houses .
What , to perverseness ?
Here comes the little villain .
I delight in masques and revels sometimes altogether .
Let him let the matter slip , and I'll give him my horse , gray Capilet .
I shall be constrained in 't to call thee knave , knight .
Not too fast !
His life I gave him and did thereto add My love , without retention or restraint , All his in dedication .
My master , not myself , lacks recompense .
Most excellent accomplished lady , the heavens rain odors on you !
I think oxen and wainropes can not hale them together .
Get him to say his prayers , good Sir Toby , get him to pray .
Give me your hand , sir .
Then he's a rogue , and a passy-measures pavin .
You might do much .
Good .
They lack retention .
No , indeed , sir ; the Lady Olivia has no folly .
You shall hear more .
Have you any commission from your lord to negotiate with my face ?
If a bloody coxcomb be a hurt , you have hurt me .
Some achieve greatness , " What sayest thou ?
Come , Sir Andrew , there's no remedy .
Even what it please my lord that shall become him .
It might have since been answered in repaying What we took from them , which , for traffic's sake , Most of our city did .
Be clamorous , and leap all civil bounds , Rather than make unprofited return .
To be Count Malvolio !
Belike this is a man of that quirk .
What is to be said to him , lady ?
Are you full of them ?
Or what are you ?
What should I think on 't ?
Peace , you rogue , no more o ' that .
Here comes the fool , i ' faith .
He is about the house .
Antonio never yet was thief or pirate , Though , I confess , on base and ground enough , Orsino's enemy .
Madam , I will .
Or I'll deliver thy indignation to him by word of mouth .
I'll help you , Sir Toby , because we'll be dressed together .
Whither , my lord ? , Cesario , husband , stay .
Oh , you are sick of self-love , Malvolio , and taste with a distempered appetite .
She took the ring of me .
M.O.A.I." This simulation is not as the former , and yet to crush this a little , it would bow to me , for every one of these letters are in my name .
This savors not much of distraction .
You may have very fit occasion for 't .
My brother he is in Elysium .
What say you sir ?
I'll be your purse-bearer and leave you For an hour .
Take away the lady .
doth sway my life." Nay , but first , let me see , let me see , let me see .
Get you all three into the boxtree .
What a caterwauling do you keep here !
Dismount thy tuck , be yare in thy preparation , for thy assailant is quick , skillful and deadly .
Good , i ' faith .
How have the hours racked and tortured me Since I have lost thee !
O , you give me ill counsel .
Good Mistress Accost , I desire better acquaintance .
Like aqua vitae with a midwife .
No , madam , he does nothing but smile .
Come , sir , away .
I sent for thee upon a sad occasion .
His counsel now might do me golden service .
Art thou good at these kickshawses , knight ?
Is 't so saucy ?
Spend this for me .
Tis not so sweet now as it was before .
Slid , I'll after him again and beat him .
These clothes are good enough to drink in , and so be these boots too .
Good fool , as ever thou wilt deserve well at my hand , help me to a candle , and pen , ink , and paper .
What , Curio ?
Where's my cousin Toby ?
Give me faith , say I .
I say , remember .
Are you a comedian ?
I am all the daughters of my father's house , And all the brothers too , and yet I know not .
Besides , you grow dishonest .
I care not for good life .
What shall you ask of me that I'll deny , That honor , saved , may upon asking give ?
What kind of woman is't ?
I could not stay behind you .
Madam , I will .
Come , boy , with me .
Or do you but counterfeit ?
The honorable lady of the house , which is she ?
My duty , madam , and most humble service .
Nay , let me alone for swearing .
Why , thou hast put him in such a dream that when the image of it leaves him he must run mad .
There's money for thee .
A noble duke , in nature As in name .
Now Jove , in his next commodity of hair , send thee a beard !
Of very ill manner .
Art thou mad ?
I never hurt you .
Why , we shall make him mad indeed .
Shall we rouse the night owl in a catch that will draw three souls out of one weaver ?
I prithee , and I'll pay thee bounteously , Conceal me what I am , and be my aid For such disguise as haply shall become The form of my intent .
I am bound to the Count Orsino's court .
Truly , madam , he holds Beelzebub at the staves ' end as well as a man in his case may do .
I'll none of it .
I am a gentleman .
Here , wear this jewel for me .
If I lose a scruple of this sport , let me be boiled to death with melancholy .
There is a fair behavior in thee , captain , And though that nature with a beauteous wall Doth oft close in pollution , yet of thee I will believe thou hast a mind that suits With this thy fair and outward character .
How now , Sir Toby Belch !
I'll pay thy pleasure then .
Hold , there's half my coffer .
Orsino .
Sebastian are you ?
If he can not , let the botcher mend him .
Let me enjoy my private .
Lie thou there ( throwing down a letter ) , for here comes the trout that must be caught with tickling .
I can tell thee where that saying was born , of "I fear no colors." Where , good Mistress Mary ?
How now , Malvolio ?
No way but gentleness , gently , gently .
A love song , a love song .
That the soul of our grandam might haply inhabit a bird .
But I know to be up late is to be up late .
Tell me that .
This is the air , that is the glorious sun .
Talkest thou nothing but of ladies ?
Who was it ?
Jove bless thee , master Parson .
You are resolute , then ?
Now Mercury endue thee with leasing , for thou speakest well of fools !
How does he love me ?
And I , most jocund , apt , and willingly , To do you rest , a thousand deaths would die .
I may command where I adore , But silence , like a Lucrece knife , With bloodless stroke my heart doth gore ; M.O.A.I .
Shall we go see the relics of this town ?
But we will draw the curtain and show you the picture .
Get him to bed , and let his hurt be looked to .
My words are as full of peace as matter .
I thank thee .
And so had mine .
In my stars I am above thee , but be not afraid of greatness .
Now heaven walks on earth .
Fool !
Only myself stood out ; For which , if I be lapsed in this place , I shall pay dear .
Nothing that can be can come between me and the full prospect of my hopes .
If I think so , I think the same of you .
There's something in 't That is deceivable .
Do you come near me now ?
Stand here , make a good show on 't .
By the Lord , madam , you wrong me , and the world shall know it .
He hath known you but three days , and already you are no stranger .
I bring no overture of war , no taxation of homage .
It is something of my negligence , nothing of my purpose .
Never in your life , I think , unless you see canary put me down .
What , what ?
I would be sorry , sir , but the fool should be as oft with your master as with my mistress : I think I saw your wisdom there .
Tut , there's life in 't , man .
I protest I take these wise men that crow so at these set kind of fools no better than the fools ' zanies .
Well , come again tomorrow .
M" , Malvolio .
This is a dear manikin to you , Sir Toby .
I will answer you with gait and entrance .
I defy lechery .
You have not seen such a thing as 'tis .
Her husband , sirrah ?
Maria once told me she did affect me , and I have heard herself come thus near , that , should she fancy , it should be one of my complexion .
Ay , 'tis strong , and it does indifferent well in a dun-colored stock .
I know his soul is in heaven , fool .
Therefore get you on and give him his desire .
Let all the rest give place .
Malvolio's coming down this walk .
Alas , sir , be patient .
Remain thou still in darkness .
This fellow is wise enough to play the fool , And to do that well craves a kind of wit .
See him delivered , Fabian ; bring him hither .
I'll make one too .
On a moderate pace I have since arrived but hither .
My lord , I do protest , O , do not swear !
Fie , thou dishonest Satan !
The cunning of her passion Invites me in this churlish messenger .
My lady bade me tell you , that , though she harbors you as her kinsman , she's nothing allied to your disorders .
Must she not then be answered ?
Tell me your mind .
And what's her history ?
Do but read .
Are you the lady of the house ?
It did come to his hands , and commands shall be executed .
Marry , sir , lullaby to your bounty till I come again .
Now , as thou lovest me , let me see his letter .
I thank you .
Come hither , Fabian .
Go look after him .
Sir Topas , Sir Topas !
I am not such an ass , but I can keep my hand dry .
Alas , their love may be called appetite , No motion of the liver , but the palate , That suffer surfeit , cloyment , and revolt ; But mine is all as hungry as the sea , And can digest as much .
Make no compare Between that love a woman can bear me And that I owe Olivia .
I'll go another way to work with him .
I thank my stars I am happy .
Get you to your lord .
Fair lady , do you think you have fools in hand ?
By my troth , I would not undertake her in this company .
For his thoughts , Would they were blanks , rather than fill'd with me .
Would thou'dst be ruled by me !
If he may be conveniently delivered , I would he were , for I am now so far in offense with my niece that I can not pursue with any safety this sport to the upshot .
Andrew Aguecheek"
Cesario , you do not keep promise with me .
I mean , she is the list of my voyage .
I warrant thou art a merry fellow and carest for nothing .
But it becomes me well enough , does 't not ?
Alas the day !
I do I know not what and fear to find Mine eye too great a flatterer for my mind .
Why , it hath bay windows transparent as barricadoes , and the clerestories toward the south-north are as lustrous as ebony .
If you offend him , I for him defy you .
Vent my folly !
Why , what are you ?
I would we were well rid of this knavery .
Wherefore are these things hid ?
Come , my young soldier , put up your iron .
I tell thee , I am as well in my wits as any man in Illyria .
A dry jest , sir .
Look you , sir , such a one I was this present .
Tell her my love , more noble than the world , Prizes not quantity of dirty lands ; The parts that fortune hath bestowed upon her , Tell her , I hold as giddily as fortune ; But 'tis that miracle and queen of gems That nature pranks her in attracts my soul .
I'll confine myself no finer than I am .
You shall know more hereafter .
A good note , that keeps you from the blow of the law .
I am not of your element .
Does he rave ?
The house will be the quieter .
When did I see thee so put down ?
None can be called deformed but the unkind .
He will bear you easily and reins well .
What's to do ?
I will be strange , stout , in yellow stockings , and cross-gartered , even with the swiftness of putting on .
Shall I play my freedom at tray-trip , and become thy bondslave ?
What I am and what I would are as secret as maidenhead .
I told him you were asleep .
If you be not mad , be gone .
Well , sir , for want of other idleness , I'll bide your proof .
Farewell .
His eyes were set at eight i ' the morning .
Sir Topas !
Approach , Sir Andrew .
I know not what 'twas but distraction .
A stoup of wine !
Sweet Sir Toby , be patient for tonight .
Good Master Fabian , grant me another request .
Methinks his words do from such passion fly , That he believes himself .
I told him you were sick .
Accost , Sir Andrew , accost .
And wished to see thee cross-gartered." Cross-gartered ?
He did me kindness , sir , drew on my side , But in conclusion put strange speech upon me .
She loves me , sure !
Hath it not , boy ?
I do remember .
For the love of God , a surgeon !
Yes , by Saint Anne , and ginger shall be hot i ' the mouth too .
I would therefore my sister had no name , sir .
Pox on 't !
Here comes Sir Toby halting .
Come , throw it o'er my face .
Taste your legs , sir .
Nor I neither .
Too old by heaven .
What shall we do else ?
Sir Toby , I must be round with you .
An 't be any way , it must be with valor , for policy I hate .
But tell me true , are you not mad indeed ?
For but a month ago I went from hence , And then 'twas fresh in murmur , as , you know , What great ones do the less will prattle of , That he did seek the love of fair Olivia .
Let me speak a little .
Have you no more to say ?
Why , man , he's a very devil .
Do you know what you say ?
Oh , ho !
How is 't with you ?
The fiend is rough and will not be roughly used .
My remembrance is very free and clear from any image of offense done to any man .
If you desire the spleen , and will laugh yourself into stitches , follow me .
Madam , yond young fellow swears he will speak with you .
Why dost thou not go to church in a galliard and come home in a coranto ?
Doth he not mend ?
Most sweet lady , A comfortable doctrine , and much may be said of it .
But , as you say , sir , let your bounty take a nap , I will awake it anon .
If it be a suit from the count , I am sick , or not at home .
Notable pirate !
The Count's gentleman , one Cesario .
What would my lord , but that he may not have , Wherein Olivia may seem serviceable ?
He is knight , dubbed with unhatched rapier and on carpet consideration , but he is a devil in private brawl .
Give me thy hand , And let me see thee in thy woman's weeds .
Here comes my noble gull-catcher .
This is the man .
Tis too late to go to bed now .
That most ingrateful boy there by your side From the rude sea's enraged and foamy mouth Did I redeem .
I have heard my father name him .
I hate ingratitude more in a man Than lying , vainness , babbling , drunkenness , Or any taint of vice whose strong corruption Inhabits our frail blood , O heavens themselves !
The lady of the Strachy married the yeoman of the wardrobe .
I'll stay a month longer .
The triplex , sir , is a good tripping measure , or the bells of Saint Bennet , sir , may put you in mind , one , two , three .
I pity you .
Who does do you wrong ?
Fare thee well .
Come by and by to my chamber .
What's she ?
Sir !
I leave my duty a little unthought of and speak out of my injury .
Fare thee well .
So thou mayst say the king lies by a beggar if a beggar dwell near him , or the church stands by thy tabor , if thy tabor stand by the church .
I am no fighter .
As I am a gentleman , I will live to be thankful to thee for 't .
Yet I suppose him virtuous , know him noble , Of great estate , of fresh and stainless youth .
I left no ring with her .
Thy reason , man ?
But , sir , I will deliver his challenge by word of mouth , set upon Aguecheek a notable report of valor , and drive the gentleman ( as I know his youth will aptly receive it ) into a most hideous opinion of his rage , skill , fury , and impetuosity .
Prithee , be content .
I think nobly of the soul , and no way approve his opinion .
Thou dost speak masterly .
No pains , sir .
I do assure you , 'tis against my will .
Whence came you , sir ?
Go , write it in a martial hand .
Pray God , he keep his oath !
He started one poor heart of mine in thee .
Yet you began rudely .
And , to inure thyself to what thou art like to be , cast thy humble slough and appear fresh .
Perchance he is not drown'd. , What think you , sailors ?
By this hand , they are scoundrels and substractors that say so of him .
Be you his eunuch , and your mute I'll be .
Seven of my people , with an obedient start , make out for him .
Let thy blood and spirit embrace them .
Some are born great , some achieve greatness , and some have greatness thrust upon 'em .
O time , thou must untangle this , not I .
To answer by the method , in the first of his heart .
I take pleasure in singing , sir .
Why , what's the matter ?
Fate , show thy force .
Why do you speak to me ?
But out of question , 'tis Maria's hand .
I have sent after him .
What is your name ?
FOOL Oh , he's drunk , Sir Toby , an hour agone .
By my troth , Sir Toby , you must come in earlier o ' nights .

Still you keep o ' the windy side of the law .
I beseech you , do me this courteous office , as to know of the knight what my offense to him is .
Here comes the Countess .
Why , this is evident to any formal capacity .
For this night , to bed , and dream on the event .
I know not , madam .
I'll write thee a challenge .
Will you go hunt , my lord ?
I have no exquisite reason for 't , but I have reason good enough .
Hast thou forgot thyself ?
The count himself here hard by woos her .
It is too hard a knot for me to untie !
Sport royal , I warrant you .
Thou canst not choose but know who I am .
Oh , if it prove , Tempests are kind and salt waves fresh in love !
Where lies your text ?
He's as tall a man as any 's in Illyria .
And for that I promised you , I'll be as good as my word .
What is he at the gate , cousin ?
Hurt him in eleven places .
Remember who commended thy yellow stockings , " Thy yellow stockings ?
Give me now leave to leave thee .
Thy smiles become thee well .
Tell me why .
Think of me as you please .
You might have saved me my pains to have taken it away yourself .
The knave counterfeits well .
But as well ?
Away with him !
A gentleman .
And when she went away now , "Let this fellow be looked to." "Fellow ! " Not "Malvolio , " nor after my degree , but "fellow." Why , everything adheres together , that no dram of a scruple , no scruple of a scruple , no obstacle , no incredulous or unsafe circumstance , what can be said ?
I tell thee true .
A little , by your favor .
I go , sir , but I would not have you to think that my desire of having is the sin of covetousness .
I shall be much bound to you for 't .
Give us the place alone .
Your cousin , my lady , takes great exceptions to your ill hours .
Most radiant , exquisite and unmatchable beauty , I pray you , tell me if this be the lady of the house , for I never saw her .
And yet complainest thou of obstruction ?
Infirmity , that decays the wise , doth ever make the better fool .
Signior Fabian , stay you by this gentleman till my return .
Make that good .
And ask no other dowry with her but such another jest .
Refuse it not .
Call in my gentlewoman .
I saw him put down the other day with an ordinary fool that
What money , sir ?
Father , I charge thee , by thy reverence , Here to unfold ( though lately we intended To keep in darkness what occasion now Reveals before 'tis ripe ) what thou dost know Hath newly passed between this youth and me .
The gentleman will , for his honor's sake , have one bout with you .
My servant , sir !
That face of his I do remember well .
My purpose is , indeed , a horse of that color .
Fie , that you'll say so !
I wish it might , for now I am your fool .
I have limed her , but it is Jove's doing , and Jove make me thankful !
When my tongue blabs , then let mine eyes not see .
A coward , a most devout coward , religious in it .
If not , an it would please you to take leave of her , she is very willing to bid you farewell .
God send you , sir , a speedy infirmity , for the better increasing your folly !
He shall see none to fear .
Not to be abed after midnight is to be up betimes , and Nay , my troth , I know not .
Ay , sir , we are some of her trappings .
Wherefore have these gifts a curtain before 'em ?
Marry , now I let go your hand , I am barren .
Fear'st thou that , Antonio ?
Hold , sir , here's my purse .
Orsino , noble sir , Be pleased that I shake off these names you give me .
Can you do it ?
Truly , sir , the better for my foes and the worse for my friends .
But if he had not been in drink , he would have tickled you othergates than he did .
Let still the woman take An elder than herself .
Too well what love women to men may owe .
Come hither , knight .
Keep your purse .
No man must know." If this should be thee , Malvolio ?
Good night , Penthesilea .
Though I struck him first , yet it's no matter for that .
My prayers , minx ?
Gentleman , God save thee .
Some are born great , "
How do you , Malvolio ?
Anything that's mended is but patched .
Yet , when I saw it last , it was besmeared As black as Vulcan in the smoke of war .
I beseech you , what manner of man is he ?
He's coming , madam ; but in very strange manner .
Here comes my lady .
Who governs here ?
Good my mouse of virtue , answer me .
He will find it comes from a clodpole .
I prithee , be gone .
I will be free from thee .
He does smile his face into more lines than is in the new map with the augmentation of the Indies .
I will do everything that thou wilt have me .
Here is yet a postscript .
Will you help ? , An ass-head , and a coxcomb , and a knave , a thin-faced knave , a gull !
Come , away !
But oh , how vile an idol proves this god !
My masters , are you mad ?
A spirit I am indeed , But am in that dimension grossly clad Which from the womb I did participate .
That you do think you are not what you are .
You can fool no more money out of me at this throw .
Wouldst thou not be glad to have the niggardly rascally sheep-biter come by some notable shame ?
I can not love him .
What's a drunken man like , fool ?
Go call him hither .
Cast thy humble slough , " says she .
Vent my folly ?
I prithee , foolish Greek , depart from me .
With drinking healths to my niece .
Do thy office .
You do mistake me , sir .
To bed ?
Still so cruel ?
If one knight give a , Would you have a love song or a song of good life ?
She's a beagle , true-bred , and one that adores me .
If one should be a prey , how much the better To fall before the lion than the wolf !
Alas , Malvolio , this is not my writing , Though , I confess , much like the character .
A mellifluous voice , as I am true knight .
Has here writ a letter to you .
Come , bring us , bring us where he is .
Belike you slew great number of his people ?
Your will ?
Ay , is 't , I warrant him .
The man grows mad .
Here comes the count .
But if she can not love you , sir ?
Will you deny me now ?
Is it so long ? , Call forth the holy father .
So could I too .
Is it a world to hide virtues in ?
How can that be ?
One draught above heat makes him a fool , the second mads him , and a third drowns him .
No , madam , I do but read madness .
Of what personage and years is he ?
I'll give 't him .
Can he that deny ?
To one of your receiving Enough is shown .
I am no fee'd post , lady .
For the love of God , your help !
The madly used Malvolio." Did he write this ?
How now , Malvolio !
Twere as good a deed as to drink when a man's a-hungry , to challenge him the field and then to break promise with him and make a fool of him .
There lies your way , due west .
And so they are .
Gracious Olivia , What do you say , Cesario ? , Good my lord , My lord would speak .
I will be proud , I will read politic authors , I will baffle Sir Toby , I will wash off gross acquaintance , I will be point- devise the very man .
What's that ?
I prithee , vent thy folly somewhere else .
Beshrew his soul for me !
Shall we do that ?
Then let thy love be younger than thyself , Or thy affection can not hold the bent .
Good beauties , let me sustain no scorn .
What is your parentage ? " "Above my fortunes , yet my state is well .
Come , sir , I will not let you go .
And so adieu , good madam .
A most extracting frenzy of mine own From my remembrance clearly banished his .
Sneck up !
Nay , but say true , does it work upon him ?
And died that day when Viola from her birth Had numbered thirteen years .
Go .
Who does beguile you ?
to fool ) Is thy lady within ?
Do it quickly .
It hangs like flax on a distaff .
Let him be the devil , an he will , I care not .
Write loyal cantons of contemned love And sing them loud even in the dead of night .
I know your favor well , Though now you have no sea-cap on your head. , Take him away .
I know thy constellation is right apt For this affair .
There is no way but this , Sir Andrew .
Fool , I'll requite it in the highest degree .
How now , my metal of India ?
If it please the eye of one , it is with me as the very true sonnet is , "Please one , and please all." Why , how dost thou , man ?
But in my conscience , sir , I do not care for you .
Shall I vent to her that thou art coming ?
It is heresy .
Do not deny .
Tis with him in standing water , between boy and man .
Nay , good Sir Toby .
I speak too loud. , Where's Malvolio ?
Still in this fashion , color , ornament , For him I imitate .
I say , there is no darkness but ignorance , in which thou art more puzzled than the Egyptians in their fog .
By this hand , I am .
These wise men that give fools money get themselves a good report , after fourteen years ' purchase .
If my lady have not called up her steward Malvolio and bid him turn you out of doors , never trust me .
Well , let it be. , What ho , Malvolio !
Marry , and it shall be done tomorrow morning if I live .
A false conclusion .
Nay , let him alone .
It alone concerns your ear .
I'll come to him .
He is not here , so please your lordship , that should sing it .
What gentleman ?
Look where the youngest wren of nine comes .
Good gentle one , give me modest assurance if you be the lady of the house , that I may proceed in my speech .
He , upon some action , Is now in durance at Malvolio's suit , A gentleman and follower of my lady's .
Yes , nightingales answer daws !
What years , i ' faith ?
And what should I do in Illyria ?
You stand amazed , But be of comfort .
This does make some obstruction in the blood , this cross-gartering , but what of that ?
He is , indeed , sir , the most skillful , bloody , and fatal opposite that you could possibly have found in any part of Illyria .
My most exquisite Sir Topas !
He's a very fool and a prodigal .
This is as uncivil as strange .
How with mine honor may I give him that Which I have given to you ?
No , believe me .
Away !
How now , gentleman ?
Tell him he shall not speak with me .
But this is from my commission .
Come , we'll have him in a dark room and bound .
I am as mad as he , If sad and merry madness equal be .
My lady will hang thee for thy absence .
Even now , sir .
Where's Antonio , then ?
I had rather than forty pound I were at home .
Jove , I thank thee !
Is this the madman ?
O good Sir Toby , hold !
He finished indeed his mortal act That day that made my sister thirteen years .
But died thy sister of her love , my boy ?
Thou'rt i ' the right .
He was a bachelor then .
Away !
Let him send no more , Unless perchance you come to me again To tell me how he takes it .
Prove true , imagination , oh , prove true , That I , dear brother , be now ta'en for you !
To the Elephant .
That's sides and heart .
Madam , the young gentleman of the Count Orsino's is returned .
My lady would not lose him for more than I'll say .
Take away the fool , gentlemen .
Hold , sir , or I'll throw your dagger o'er the house .
And so perchance may he be .
Dear lady , Give me leave , beseech you .
Observe him , for the love of mockery , for I know this letter will make a contemplative idiot of him .
Of what nature the wrongs are thou hast done him , I know not , but thy intercepter , full of despite , bloody as the hunter , attends thee at the orchard end .
Come , sir , I pray you , go .
Then hadst thou had an excellent head of hair .
Od's lifelings , here he is ! , You broke my head for nothing , and that that I did , I was set on to do 't by Sir Toby .
This is a practise As full of labor as a wise man's art , For folly that he wisely shows is fit .
Let the garden door be shut , and leave me to my hearing .
Wilt thou set thy foot o ' my neck ?
Let our catch be "Thou Knave." "Hold thy peace , thou knave , " knight ?
But yet I can not love him ; He might have took his answer long ago .
Bonos dies , Sir Toby .
We'll whisper o'er a couplet or two of most sage saws .
That's all one : has hurt me , and there's the end on 't .
My niece shall take note of it , and assure thyself , there is no love-broker in the world can more prevail in man's commendation with woman than report of valor .
I think not so , my lord .
How is't with you , sir ?
If this young gentleman Have done offence , I take the fault on me .
Let us therefore eat and drink .
If you will let your lady know I am here to speak with her , and bring her along with you , it may awake my bounty further .
He knows I know him well .
Marry , I saw your niece do more favors to the Count's servingman than ever she bestowed upon me .
Speak your office .
Plague on 't , an I thought he had been valiant and so cunning in fence , I'd have seen him damned ere I'd have challenged him .
Oh , say so , and so be !
My father had a daughter loved a man As it might be , perhaps , were I a woman , I should your lordship .
Antonio , O my dear Antonio !
A fiend like thee might bear my soul to hell .
He says he'll come .
If this were played upon a stage now , I could condemn it as an improbable fiction .
Pursue him and entreat him to a peace .
I'll drink to her as long as there is a passage in my throat and drink in Illyria .
em all three all ready .
Would it be better , madam , than I am ?
Here , madam , at your service .
Tis not for gravity to play at cherry-pit with Satan .
Good madonna , give me leave to prove you a fool .
And by all means stir on the youth to an answer .
But here the lady comes .
You are now out of your text .
She returns this ring to you , sir .
So do not I .
I know thee well .
O , by your leave , I pray you , I bade you never speak again of him .
Nay , that's certain .
Go shake your ears !
That defense thou hast , betake thee to 't .
Lead me on .
He hath not told us of the captain yet .
She did show favor to the youth in your sight only to exasperate you , to awake your dormouse valor , to put fire in your heart and brimstone in your liver .
No man must know." What follows ?
What o ' that ?
My niece is already in the belief that he's mad .
I had a pass with him , rapier , scabbard , and all , and he gives me the stuck-in with such a mortal motion , that it is inevitable .
I did think , by the excellent constitution of thy leg , it was formed under the star of a galliard .
Madam ?
I will make your peace with him if I can .
Nay , come , I prithee .
He left this ring behind him , Would I or not .
No , sooth , sir .
Hold little faith , though thou hast too much fear .
Virtue is beauty , but the beauteous evil Are empty trunks o'erflourished by the devil .
Most certain .
A good lenten answer .
Very sweet and contagious , i ' faith .
Master Malvolio ?
But to read his right wits is to read thus .
Not so , sir , I do care for something .
He can not by the duello avoid it .
Good madam , let me see your face .
I know I can do it .
Since the youth of the count's was today with thy lady , she is much out of quiet .
An we do not , it is pity of our lives .
Out o ' tune , sir .
Challenge me the count's youth to fight with him .
I saw thee late at the Count Orsino's .
I have heard of some kind of men that put quarrels purposely on others , to taste their valor .
What will become of this ?
Observe his construction of it .
Send one presently to Sir Toby .
And on that vice in him will my revenge find notable cause to work .
Twas never merry world Since lowly feigning was call'd compliment .
He seems to have a foreknowledge of that too , and therefore comes to speak with you .
Nay , I prithee , put on this gown and this beard .
Why , would that have mended my hair ?
Sir Topas , Sir Topas , good Sir Topas , go to my lady , Out , hyperbolical fiend !
Yes , and shall do till the pangs of death shake him .
I will on with my speech in your praise and then show you the heart of my message .
He's in yellow stockings .
Back you shall not to the house , unless you undertake that with me which with as much safety you might answer him .
Cesario , come , For so you shall be , while you are a man .
Alas , I took great pains to study it , and 'tis poetical .
He's fortified against any denial .
Orsino .
Thou mightst have done this without thy beard and gown .
Did she see thee the while , old boy ?
Who you are and what you would are out of my welkin , I might say "element , " but the word is overworn .
Here he comes with your niece .
Make the trial of it in any constant question .
By my troth , sir , no , though it please you to be one of my friends .
He is sad and civil And suits well for a servant with my fortunes .
I know my physic will work with him .
I could marry this wench for this device .
I will meditate the while upon some horrid message for a challenge .
Come on , to 't .
And cross-gartered ?
Nothing but this : your true love for my master .
Nay , I'll ne'er believe a madman till I see his brains .
Make me a willow cabin at your gate And call upon my soul within the house .
But you , sir , altered that , for some hour before you took me from the breach of the sea was my sister drowned .
I will prove it legitimate , sir , upon the oaths of judgment and reason .
Sir , shall I to this lady ?
Be not afraid of greatness." 'T was well writ .
We shall have a rare letter from him : but you'll not deliver 't ?
Go to , thou art made , if thou desirest to be so , " Am I made ?
In the wars .
Yes , being kept together and put to use .
Now let's have a catch .
His employment between his lord and my niece confirms no less .
Like a drowned man , a fool and a madman .
Fare you well at once .
Good Maria , let this fellow be looked to .
It doth not fit me .
If that this simple syllogism will serve , so .
What manner of man ?
Let's to bed , knight .
Madam , you have done me wrong , Notorious wrong .
I say , this house is as dark as ignorance , though ignorance were as dark as hell .
I have been dear to him , lad , some two thousand strong , or so .
No , sir , I live by the church .
Give me .
Go , hang yourselves all !
I'll not meddle with him .
He has been yonder i ' the sun practising behavior to his own shadow this half hour .
I'll no more of you .
It begins "Hold thy peace." I shall never begin if I hold my peace .
A wreck past hope he was .
If this fall into thy hand , revolve .
What are you ?
Yet there he was , and there I found this credit , That he did range the town to seek me out .
In voices well divulged , free , learned , and valiant ; And in dimension and the shape of nature A gracious person .
You mistake , sir .
How now , mistress ?
I had as lief be a Brownist as a politician .
Above my fortunes , yet my state is well .
Pray you , sir , do you know of this matter ?
I hate it as an unfilled can .
To anger him , we'll have the bear again , and we will fool him black and blue .
And you too , sir .
I am afraid this great lubber , the world , will prove a cockney .
Not yet old enough for a man , nor young enough for a boy , as a squash is before 'tis a peascod , or a codling when 'tis almost an apple .
My kind Antonio , I can no other answer make but thanks , And thanks , and ever thanks .
I hate a drunken rogue .
And for his cowardship , ask Fabian .
If you will see it , follow me .
Why , then , build me thy fortunes upon the basis of valor .
Jove and my stars be praised !
If thou hast her not i ' the end , call me "Cut." If I do not , never trust me , take it how you will .
Why , he has three thousand ducats a year .
Go , Sir Andrew .
For youth is bought more oft than begged or borrow'd .
An they be not , let them hang themselves in their own straps .
What means this lady ?
Go off , I discard you .
Yet you will be hanged for being so long absent .
I am sure no man hath any quarrel to me .
Farewell , fair cruelty .
You have said , sir .
Alas , that they are so , To die even when they to perfection grow !
Come , sir , you peevishly threw it to her , and her will is it should be so returned .
Though you have put me into darkness and given your drunken cousin rule over me , yet have I the benefit of my senses as well as your Ladyship .
One would think his mother's milk were scarce out of him .
What a plague means my niece , to take the death of her brother thus ?
If you can separate yourself and your misdemeanors , you are welcome to the house .
I would you were as I would have you be !
What dost thou mean ?
I will not give my part of this sport for a pension of thousands to be paid from the Sophy .
If thou darest tempt me further , draw thy sword .
Stay , I prithee , tell me what thou thinkest of me .
Madam , there is at the gate a young gentleman much desires to speak with you .
Away before me to sweet beds of flowers .
About your years , my lord .
He is very well-favored , and he speaks very shrewishly .
For Monsieur Malvolio , let me alone with him .
But I perceive in you so excellent a touch of modesty that you will not extort from me what I am willing to keep in .
Souls and bodies hath he divorced three , and his incensement at this moment is so implacable that satisfaction can be none but by pangs of death and sepulchre .
I would exult , man .
For him , I think not on him .
I think we do know the sweet Roman hand .
Madam !
I'll make division of my present with you .
Make him believe thou art Sir Topas the curate .
No woman's heart So big , to hold so much .
Nay , pursue him now , lest the device take air and taint .
Sir , I bade them take away you .
Art not thou the Lady Olivia's fool ?
This will so fright them both that they will kill one another by the look , like cockatrices .
How vexest thou this man !
Or o ' mine either ?
Well , go thy way .
And you , sir .
It hath no tongue to vex you .
So I do , madonna .
Fear not , Cesario .
Be curst and brief .
I am bound to your niece , sir .
A baubling vessel was he captain of , For shallow draught and bulk unprizable , With which such scathful grapple did he make With the most noble bottom of our fleet , That very envy and the tongue of loss Cried fame and honor on him. , What's the matter ?
She that would alter services with thee , The Fortunate Unhappy" Daylight and champaign discovers not more .
And your horse now would make him an ass .
By your patience , no .
What wouldst thou now ?
Past question , for thou seest it will not curl by nature .
Most certain , if you are she , you do usurp yourself , for what is yours to bestow is not yours to reserve .
By my troth , thou hast an open hand .
Look then to be well edified when the fool delivers the madman .
Let some of my people have a special care of him .
At your request !
How will this fadge ?
I'll do my best To woo your lady , Whoe'er I woo , myself would be his wife .
What thinkest thou of his opinion ?
A very dishonest paltry boy , and more a coward than a hare .
Sooth , but you must .
Are they like to take dust , like Mistress Mall's picture ?
Is there no respect of place , persons , nor time in you ?
Farewell .
He left behind him myself and a sister , both born in an hour .
Sir Toby Belch !
Do you not hear , fellows ?
That's a degree to love .
Madam , I am most apt to embrace your offer .
Good madonna , why mournest thou ?
If I do not usurp myself , I am .
I am very comptible , even to the least sinister usage .
They that add , moreover , he's drunk nightly in your company .
This concurs directly with the letter .
Madam , I come to whet your gentle thoughts On his behalf .
Anything .
Will you walk towards him ?
As hell , Sir Topas .
Fool , fool , fool , I say !
And you , sir .
Gentlewoman , my lady calls .
Slight , will you make an ass o ' me ?
The better for thy friends .
I must catechise you for it , madonna .
Well held out , i ' faith .
I am the man .
She did commend my yellow stockings of late , she did praise my leg being cross-gartered , and in this she manifests herself to my love , and with a kind of injunction , drives me to these habits of her liking .
I have 't in my nose too .
Sayest thou that house is dark ?
Why , man ?
Why , "some are born great , some achieve greatness , and some have greatness thrown upon them." I was one , sir , in this interlude , one Sir Topas , sir , but that's all one .
Where goes Cesario ?
If this letter move him not , his legs can not .
Ay , ay .
More matter for a May morning .
I do not now fool myself , to let imagination jade me , for every reason excites to this , that my lady loves me .
He is as horribly conceited of him , and pants and looks pale , as if a bear were at his heels .
Therefore this letter , being so excellently ignorant , will breed no terror in the youth .
Well-a-day that you were , sir .
I will do so .
Well , God give them wisdom that have it .
I can say little more than I have studied , and that question's out of my part .
I saw 't i ' the orchard .
I prithee now , ungird thy strangeness and tell me what I shall vent to my lady .
You , uncivil lady , To whose ingrate and unauspicious altars My soul the faithfull'st off'rings have breathed out That e'er devotion tendered , what shall I do ?
So , let me hear you speak .
Haply your eye shall light upon some toy You have desire to purchase , and your store , I think , is not for idle markets , sir .
I will give out divers schedules of my beauty .
How now !
Receive it so .
You are well fleshed .
If it be thus to dream , still let me sleep !
An you love me , let's do 't .
Hang him , foul collier !
Is 't not well done ?
Good .
This shall end without the perdition of souls .
It may be worth thy pains , for I can sing And speak to him in many sorts of music That will allow me very worth his service .
Hold , there's expenses for thee .
How now ?
If I could make that resemble something in me , Softly !
Lechery !
Excellent .
The gentleness of all the gods go with thee !
But he has promised me , as he is a gentleman and a soldier , he will not hurt you .
Why , let her except , before excepted .
Taurus !
I'll make the motion .
How quickly the wrong side may be turned outward !
Good fool , for my brother's death .
She is not worth thee , then .
But , come what may , I do adore thee so That danger shall seem sport , and I will go .
I'll serve this duke .
Therefore in my presence still smile , dear my sweet , I prithee."
This is open .
Give me some music .
And yet , by the very fangs of malice I swear , I am not that I play .
Sir Toby will be sworn that I am no fox , but he will not pass his word for two pence that you are no fool .
Good Sir Toby !
I'll call Sir Toby the whilst .
I must obey .
Do 't , knight .
What news from her ?
There is no obstruction in this .
What country , friends , is this ?
Have I , Malvolio ?
Was not this love indeed ?
Why , I think so .
Fare you well .
You , sir ?
Put up your sword .
Out of my sight ! , Be not offended , dear Cesario. , Rudesby , be gone !
Come on .
Does she so ?
Ay , husband .
Who hath made this havoc with them ?
I did send , After the last enchantment you did here , A ring in chase of you .
I could not find him at the Elephant .
If it will not , what remedy ?

Pronounce this sentence then : Women may fall when there's no strength in men .
How sound is she asleep !
Ay , you have been a mouse-hunt in your time , But I will watch you from such watching now .
The ground is bloody. , Search about the churchyard .
An eagle , madam , Hath not so green , so quick , so fair an eye As Paris hath .
Came he not home tonight ?
I strike quickly , being moved .
Hadst thou no poison mixed , no sharp-ground knife , No sudden mean of death , though ne'er so mean , But "banished" to kill me ? , "Banished" !
Though news be sad , yet tell them merrily .
I would thou hadst my bones and I thy news .
Is it good e'en ?
Did you ne'er hear say , "Two may keep counsel , putting one away" ?
Ay , marry , go , I say , and fetch him hither. , Now , afore God , this reverend holy friar !
No warmth , no breath shall testify thou livest .
Come , civil night , Thou sober-suited matron , all in black , And learn me how to lose a winning match Played for a pair of stainless maidenhoods .
Your lady mother is coming to your chamber .
My daughter he hath wedded .
Susan and she , God rest all Christian souls ! , Were of an age .
Dry sorrow drinks our blood .
I'll to the friar to know his remedy .
What , mistress !
Cry but "Ay me ! " Pronounce but "love" and "dove." Speak to my gossip Venus one fair word , One nickname for her purblind son and heir , Young Abraham Cupid , he that shot so true When King Cophetua loved the beggar maid. , He heareth not , he stirreth not , he moveth not .
Go in , and tell my lady I am gone , Having displeased my father , to Lawrence's cell To make confession and to be absolved .
Let me see her .
It is "music with her silver sound" because musicians have no gold for sounding .
The world is not thy friend nor the world's law .
Stay , then .
Art thou gone so , love , lord ?
Tybalt , my cousin !
And sayst thou yet that exile is not death ?
O me !
I dare draw as soon as another man if I see occasion in a good quarrel and the law on my side .
Our whole city is much bound to him .
Can you not conceive ?
The citizens are up , and Tybalt slain .
Do you like this haste ?
Oh , by this count I shall be much in years Ere I again behold my Romeo .
Who knocks so hard ?
Her vestal livery is but sick and green , And none but fools do wear it .
It makes me mad .
Hie , make haste , Make haste .
Be ruled by me .
O woeful , woeful , woeful day !
Come hither , Nurse .
What , rouse thee , man !
And so , good Capulet , which name I tender As dearly as my own , be satisfied .
Raise up the Montagues .
Or if it did not , Your first is dead , or 'twere as good he were , As living here and you no use of him .
Feeling so the loss , Can not choose but ever weep the friend .
Art thou a man ?
And stay , good Nurse .
Not in a grave , To lay one in , another out to have .
Supper is done , and we shall come too late .
They'll be in scarlet straight at any news .
Yea , " quoth he , "Dost thou fall upon thy face ?
Could you not take some occasion without giving ?
Have you got leave to go to shrift today ?
Benedicite .
I will be deaf to pleading and excuses .
O woe !
I will frown as I pass by , and let them take it as they list .
Tis torture and not mercy .
I'll play the housewife for this once .
All men call thee fickle .
By the hour of nine .
Then plainly know my heart's dear love is set On the fair daughter of rich Capulet .
The other did not so .
O , pardon me for bringing these ill news , Since you did leave it for my office , sir .
Thou hast quarreled with a man for coughing in the street because he hath wakened thy dog that hath lain asleep in the sun .
Stand not amazed .
And what says My concealed lady to our canceled love ?
Call her forth to me .
The second cock hath crowed .
And if you leave me so , you do me wrong .
What less than doomsday is the Prince's doom ?
I bear no hatred , blessed man , for , lo , My intercession likewise steads my foe .
Life and these lips have long been separated .
The quarrel is between our masters and us their men .
Thou art not conquered .
When and where and how We met , we wooed and made exchange of vow , I'll tell thee as we pass , but this I pray : That thou consent to marry us today .
O Romeo , Romeo !
Thy husband in thy bosom there lies dead , And Paris too .
Being holiday , the beggar's shop is shut .
Lovers can see to do their amorous rites By their own beauties , or , if love be blind , It best agrees with night .
Romeo is banished." There is no end , no limit , measure , bound , In that word's death .
Wherefore weep I then ?
Although I joy in thee , I have no joy of this contract tonight .
Well , you have made a simple choice .
Strike , drum .
For I ne'er saw true beauty till this night .
Weeping and wailing over Tybalt's corse .
Farewell , my coz .
Tis twenty year till then .
Courage , man .
What shall I swear by ?
All this is comfort .
Give me a torch .
Love give me strength , and strength shall help afford .
Why should you fall into so deep an O ?
Arise .
Is the day so young ?
Fie , how my bones ache !
I will not fail .
And when I do , I swear It shall be Romeo , whom you know I hate , Rather than Paris .
Tybalt , that murderer , which way ran he ?
Take thou some new infection to thy eye , And the rank poison of the old will die .
Open the tomb .
Hood my unmanned blood bating in my cheeks , With thy black mantle , till strange love , grow bold , Think true love acted simple modesty .
Juliet ! , Fast , I warrant her , she. , Why , lamb !
Uncle , this is a Montague , our foe , A villain that is hither come in spite To scorn at our solemnity this night .
Romeo !
By my head , here comes the Capulets .
My invocation Is fair and honest .
Tush , I will stir about , And all things shall be well , I warrant thee , wife .
May not one speak ?
Marry , 'tis enough .
Nurse , commend me to thy lady and mistress .
What hast thou found ?
What is yond gentleman ?
What is this ?
Night's candles are burnt out , and jocund day Stands tiptoe on the misty mountain tops .
The son and heir of old Tiberio .
Wouldst thou withdraw it ?
Too familiar Is my dear son with such sour company .
Their course of love , the tidings of her death .
Seigneur Martino and his wife and daughters ; County Anselme and his beauteous sisters ; The lady widow of Vitruvio ; Seigneur Placentio and his lovely nieces ; Mercutio and his brother Valentine ; Mine uncle Capulet , his wife and daughters ; My fair niece Rosaline and Livia ;
Most miserable hour that e'er time saw In lasting labor of his pilgrimage .
They pray ; grant thou , lest faith turn to despair .
Think upon these gone .
An if he hear thee , thou wilt anger him .
Therefore be patient .
Tis since the earthquake now eleven years , And she was weaned , I never shall forget it , Of all the days of the year , upon that day .
Who is 't that calls ?
As sweet repose and rest Come to thy heart as that within my breast .
These happy masks that kiss fair ladies ' brows , Being black , puts us in mind they hide the fair .
Oh , then I see that madmen have no ears .
As I remember , this should be the house .
O woeful day , O woeful day !
A challenge , on my life .
But I'll be hanged , sir , if he wear your livery .
O , tell me , Friar , tell me , In what vile part of this anatomy Doth my name lodge ?
Out on her , hilding !
I will die , And leave him all .
The curfew bell hath rung .
Look , love , what envious streaks Do lace the severing clouds in yonder east .
What noise is here ?
O , what more favor can I do to thee , Than with that hand that cut thy youth in twain To sunder his that was thine enemy ?
My lord and you were then at Mantua. , Nay , I do bear a brain. , But , as I said , When it did taste the wormwood on the nipple Of my dug and felt it bitter , pretty fool , To see it tetchy and fall out with the dug !
Good even to my ghostly confessor .
Not I , believe me .
Nay , I am the very pink of courtesy .
The slip , sir , the slip .
Art thou so bare and full of wretchedness , And fear'st to die ?
Here lies the county slain , And Juliet bleeding , warm and newly dead , Who here hath lain these two days buried. , Go , tell the Prince .
Will it not be ?
Meantime forbear , And let mischance be slave to patience. , Bring forth the parties of suspicion .
Ay , pilgrim , lips that they must use in prayer .
What ?
Now will he sit under a medlar tree And wish his mistress were that kind of fruit As maids call medlars when they laugh alone. , O Romeo , that she were !
How is it with her ?
He bears him like a portly gentleman , And , to say truth , Verona brags of him To be a virtuous and well-governed youth .
I hear some noise within .
Blind is his love and best befits the dark .
Lady , come from that nest Of death , contagion , and unnatural sleep .
No words can that woe sound .
Commend me to thy mistress .
Romeo .
I'll to him .
Famine is in thy cheeks .
Why , I am glad on 't .
Is your man secret ?
What eye but such an eye would spy out such a quarrel ?
God 'i ' good e'en .
See how she leans her cheek upon her hand .
Oh , where is Romeo ?
Hie you to the cell .
But passion lends them power , time means , to meet , Tempering extremities with extreme sweet .
Not to his father's .
Would I were sleep and peace , so sweet to rest .
Commend me to thy lady .
A sick man in sadness makes his will , A word ill urged to one that is so ill .
Lay hand on heart , advise .
But , as I said , On Lammas Eve at night shall she be fourteen .
For I had then laid wormwood to my dug , Sitting in the sun under the dovehouse wall .
My dearest cousin and my dearer lord ?
A braggart , a rogue , a villain that fights by the book of arithmetic !
I am aweary .
Is Romeo slaughtered , and is Tybalt dead ?
Have you delivered to her our decree ?
But all so soon as the all-cheering sun Should in the farthest east begin to draw The shady curtains from Aurora's bed , Away from light steals home my heavy son ,
Had she affections and warm youthful blood , She would be as swift in motion as a ball .
I would not for the wealth of all the town Here in my house do him disparagement .
And from her womb children of divers kind We sucking on her natural bosom find , Many for many virtues excellent , None but for some and yet all different .
The bridegroom he is come already .
I do defy thy commination And apprehend thee for a felon here .
I pray you , tell my lord and father , madam , I will not marry yet .
And is he a man to encounter Tybalt ?
Oh , she is lame !
I would the fool were married to her grave !
Send thy man away .
She speaks , yet she says nothing .
I must hence to wait .
Let me alone .
Nay , good goose , bite not .
Oh , she knew well Thy love did read by rote , that could not spell .
At this same ancient feast of Capulet's Sups the fair Rosaline whom thou so loves With all the admired beauties of Verona .
Or did I dream it so ?
For what , I pray thee ?
So will ye , I am sure , that you love me .
She's not well married that lives married long , But she's best married that dies married young .
Why , may one ask ?
Well get you gone .
Upon his brow shame is ashamed to sit , For 'tis a throne where honor may be crowned .
Here , sir , a ring she bid me give you , sir .
Here comes the lady .
We have a trifling foolish banquet towards. , Is it e'en so ?
Fie , fie !
Hang him , Jack !
What says he of our marriage ?
It is not day .
Love's heralds should be thoughts , Which ten times faster glide than the sun's beams , Driving back shadows over louring hills .
I have more care to stay than will to go .
I will give you the minstrel .
Our solemn hymns to sullen dirges change , Our bridal flowers serve for a buried corse , And all things change them to the contrary .
Go and trim her up .
Yet I should kill thee with much cherishing .
Your plantain leaf is excellent for that .
Can I go forward when my heart is here ?
The fee simple ?
Let me be ta'en .
No matter .
Oh , God 'i ' good e'en .
Some twenty of them fought in this black strife , And all those twenty could but kill one life .
What are they , beseech your ladyship ?
The heads of the maids ?
I have watched ere now All night for lesser cause , and ne'er been sick .
Or , if you do not , make the bridal bed In that dim monument where Tybalt lies .
Tis almost morning .
Thou shalt be loggerhead. , Good faith , 'tis day .
Mass , and well said .

Apothecary !
Father , what news ?
I drink to thee .
They must take it in sense that feel it .
Happily met , my lady and my wife .
By a name I know not how to tell thee who I am .
Madam , your mother craves a word with you .
O rude unthankfulness !
Tush , thou art deceived .
Be fickle , fortune , For then , I hope , thou wilt not keep him long , But send him back .
Oh , no .
Well , think of marriage now .
Make it a word and a blow .
Prates too. , What say you , James Soundpost ?
Poor soul , thy face is much abused with tears .
Quarrel , sir ?
Nay , if our wits run the wild-goose chase , I am done , for thou hast more of the wild-goose in one of thy wits than , I am sure , I have in my whole five .
By my holy order , I thought thy disposition better tempered .
O woeful sympathy , Piteous predicament !
Yet I will adventure .
Fie , fie , thou shamest thy shape , thy love , thy wit , Which , like a usurer , abound'st in all And usest none in that true use indeed Which should bedeck thy shape , thy love , thy wit .
Then I'll be brief .
Good heart , at what ?
Shame come to Romeo !
What further woe conspires against mine age ?
No better .
Yea , " quoth my husband , "Fall'st upon thy face ?
My master is the great rich Capulet , and if you be not of the house of Montagues , I pray come and crush a cup of wine .
Give me that mattock and the wrenching iron .
Farewell , dear Father .
The what ?
And death , not Romeo , take my maidenhead !
Tis not to me she speaks .
Calling death "banishment , " Thou cutt'st my head off with a golden ax And smilest upon the stroke that murders me .
O blessed , blessed night !
Indeed , I should have asked thee that before .
Arms , take your last embrace .
Content thee , gentle coz .
What will you give us ?
If I do so , it will be of more price Being spoke behind your back than to your face .
Peace , you mumbling fool !
Is love a tender thing ?
Monday , my lord .
Why rail'st thou on thy birth , the heaven , and earth ?
That ever I should live to see thee dead .
Go , get thee to thy love , as was decreed .
The time is very short .
An I were so apt to quarrel as thou art , any man should buy the fee simple of my life for an hour and a quarter .
What , lamb !
This trick may chance to scathe you , I know what .
Ay , forsooth .
Ay , the heads of the maids , or their maidenheads .
Shake ! " quoth the dovehouse .
Mercutio , thou consort'st with Romeo .
And how doth she ?
What , Nurse , I say !
Shall I be married then tomorrow morning ?
You say well .
Here , here will I remain With worms that are thy chamber maids .
If I had , my weapon should quickly have been out , I warrant you .
No .
Well , peace be with you , sir .
How , how , how , how ?
Saint Francis be my speed !
I hear thou must , and nothing may prorogue it , On Thursday next be married to this county .
Hast thou no letters to me from the friar ?
Hold him in safety till the Prince come hither .
Out .
O ' Thursday be it , then. , Go you to Juliet ere you go to bed .
It was the nightingale , and not the lark , That pierced the fearful hollow of thine ear .
Oh , in this love , you love your child so ill That you run mad , seeing that she is well .
Her lord is come .
A plague o ' both your houses !
How now , who calls ?
Ay , mine own fortune in my misery .
Hie to your chamber .
Doth she not count her blessed , Unworthy as she is , that we have wrought So worthy a gentleman to be her bride ?
Yes , madam .
But , I'll warrant you , when I say so , she looks as pale as any clout in the versal world .
Therefore stay yet .
Either my eyesight fails , or thou look'st pale .
Sir Paris , I will make a desperate tender Of my child's love .
What is your will ?
I saw no man use you at his pleasure .
Wife !
Find them out whose names are written here ?
Madam , in happy time , what day is that ?
I thought all for the best .
I nursed her daughter that you talked withal .
O , then , dear saint , let lips do what hands do .
This torture should be roared in dismal hell .
Spare not for the cost .
My husband is on earth , my faith in heaven .
But wherefore , villain , didst thou kill my cousin ?
Were you by when it began ?
Nurse !
How oddly thou repliest !
Come , is the bride ready to go to church ?
Warrant thee , my man's as true as steel .
You are a lover .
Why , no .
Wisely and slow .
Then move not , while my prayer's effect I take .
And too soon marred are those so early made .
Am I like such a fellow ?
One kiss , and I'll descend .
Down with the Montagues !
I would have made it short , for I was come to the whole depth of my tale , and meant , indeed , to occupy the argument no longer .
Peace , ho , for shame !
We follow thee. , Juliet , the county stays .
As much to him , else is his thanks too much .
I would forget it fain , But oh , it presses to my memory , Like damned guilty deeds to sinners ' minds .
O lamentable day !
Hark you , sir .
Things have fall'n out , sir , so unluckily , That we have had no time to move our daughter .
There is no world without Verona walls But purgatory , torture , hell itself .
God's bread !
And yet thou wilt tutor me from quarreling !
I'll have this knot knit up tomorrow morning .
O deadly sin !
He is wise , And , on my life , hath stol'n him home to bed .
Trust to 't , bethink you .
That villain cousin would have killed my husband .
O Lord , I could have stayed here all the night To hear good counsel .
I know thou wilt say "ay , " And I will take thy word .
Your part in her you could not keep from death , But heaven keeps his part in eternal life .
Well , girl , thou weep'st not so much for his death , As that the villain lives which slaughtered him .
Fly hence and leave me .
This bud of love , by summer's ripening breath , May prove a beauteous flower when next we meet .
See where she comes from shrift with merry look .
Mercutio's kinsman , noble County Paris .
Methinks I see my cousin's ghost Seeking out Romeo , that did spit his body Upon a rapier's point .
Is he gone and hath nothing ?
Will you pluck your sword out of his pilcher by the ears ?
Is 't good or bad ?
Here were the servants of your adversary , And yours , close fighting ere I did approach .
Get me ink and paper , And hire post horses .
You have dancing shoes With nimble soles .
Stay but a little .
Yet put it out , for I would not be seen .
Nay , gentle Romeo , we must have you dance .
Virtue itself turns vice , being misapplied , And vice sometime by action dignified .
So ho !
He speaks not true .
Your mother .
Parting is such sweet sorrow That I shall say good night till it be morrow .
Wash they his wounds with tears ?
Was I with you there for the goose ?
Good morrow to you both .
Go , girl , seek happy nights to happy days .
Come , death , and welcome !
That shall she .
Evermore weeping for your cousin's death ?
Hold , take these keys , and fetch more spices , Nurse .
Tybalt is gone , and Romeo banished .
Out , alas !
I will bring you thither .
Madam !
Let them begin .
Hence , be gone , away !
By'r Lady , thirty years .
Thou know'st the mask of night is on my face , Else would a maiden blush bepaint my cheek For that which thou hast heard me speak tonight .
Tis now near night .
Methinks I see thee now , thou art so low As one dead in the bottom of a tomb .
Bondage is hoarse , and may not speak aloud , Else would I tear the cave where Echo lies , And make her airy tongue more hoarse than mine , With repetition of "My Romeo ! " It is my soul that calls upon my name .
What misadventure is so early up That calls our person from our morning rest ?
Mine shall be spent When theirs are dry , for Romeo's banishment .
O heavy day !
Hold , then .
Hie to high fortune !
Yea , noise ?
Oh , mickle is the powerful grace that lies In herbs , plants , stones , and their true qualities .
You know not what you do .
Do not swear at all .
Is it my lady mother ?
Thou shalt not stir one foot to seek a foe .
Say thou but "ay , " And that bare vowel Than the death-darting eye of cockatrice .
What , dost thou make us minstrels ?
Wherefore storm you so ?
I'll lay fourteen of my teeth , and yet , to my teen be it spoken , I have but four , she is not fourteen .
A jealous hood , a jealous hood !
Welcome from Mantua .
Go thou to Juliet , help to deck up her .
What a pestilent knave is this same !
Whose house ?
What day is this ?
Not life , but love in death .
Thus then in brief : The valiant Paris seeks you for his love .
Put up thy sword , Or manage it to part these men with me .
What's your will ?
It is not yet near day .
No , no .
Tut , I have lost myself .
Thou hast amazed me .
One fairer than my love ?
I wot well where he is .
Get thee gone , And hire those horses .
Bear hence this body and attend our will .
Eyes , look your last .
Then have at thee , boy !
I do remember well where I should be , And there I am .
Friends , part ! " and , swifter than his tongue , His agile arm beats down their fatal points , And 'twixt them rushes , underneath whose arm An envious thrust from Tybalt hit the life Of stout Mercutio , and then Tybalt fled .
Ah , my back , my back !
Before and apace .
His fault concludes but what the law should end , The life of Tybalt .
The all-seeing sun Ne'er saw her match since first the world begun .
Accursed , unhappy , wretched , hateful day !
The earth , that's nature's mother , is her tomb .
Thou need'st not to be gone .
More light and light it grows .
Thus from my lips , by thine , my sin is purged .
Full half an hour .
Come between us , good Benvolio .
I'll make you quiet. , What , cheerly , my hearts !
No , my good lord .
We shall be much unfurnished for this time .
My life were better ended by their hate Than death prorogued , wanting of thy love .
She's cold .
Ask for me tomorrow , and you shall find me a grave man .
What villain , madam ?
My dismal scene I needs must act alone .
Which way ran he that killed Mercutio ?
No money , on my faith , but the gleek .
Chopped logic !
Go hence .
Let them affright thee .
There , where the torch doth burn .
A great suspicion .
Leave me and do the thing I bid thee do .
I will go call the watch .
Hie you to church .
Tell me in sadness , who is that you love .
His son is thirty .
And here stands all your state : Either be gone before the watch be set , Or by the break of day disguised from hence .
Tell him so yourself , And see how he will take it at your hands .
Live , and hereafter say A madman's mercy bid thee run away .
Now , afore God , I am so vexed that every part about me quivers .
Ha ?
Oh , let us hence .
Out , you baggage !
Have I thought long to see this morning's face , And doth it give me such a sight as this ?
A cup , closed in my true love's hand ?
Seigneur Valentio and his cousin Tybalt ; Lucio and the lively Helena." A fair assembly .
Madam , I am here .
The clock struck nine when I did send the Nurse .
Your love says , like an honest gentleman , and a courteous , and a kind , and a handsome , and , I warrant , a virtuous , Where is your mother ?
And why , my Lady Wisdom ?
Stand , an you be a man .
What , have you dined at home ?
The gray-eyed morn smiles on the frowning night , Checkering the eastern clouds with streaks of light , And fleckled darkness like a drunkard reels From forth day's path and Titan's fiery wheels .
Your looks are pale and wild , and do import Some misadventure .
Let me dispute with thee of thy estate .
Stand up .
Come , Romeo .
Our instruments to melancholy bells , Our wedding cheer to a sad burial feast .
O holy Friar , O , tell me , holy Friar , Where is my lady's lord ?
O nature , what hadst thou to do in hell When thou didst bower the spirit of a fiend In moral paradise of such sweet flesh ?
Good thou , save me a piece of marchpane , and , as thou loves me , let the porter let in Susan Grindstone and Nell. , Antony and Potpan !
What sayst thou , my dear Nurse ?
Have not saints lips , and holy palmers too ?
I stand on sudden haste .
Montague !
Go , be gone .
Yea , is the worst well ?
That's my good son .
I stretch it out for that word "broad , " which , added to the goose , proves thee far and wide a broad goose .
Tis he , that villain Romeo .
What wilt thou tell her , Nurse ?
Ay , those attires are best .
Oh , that I were a glove upon that hand That I might touch that cheek !
I have a soul of lead So stakes me to the ground I can not move .
Oh , look !
Many a morning hath he there been seen , With tears augmenting the fresh morning's dew , Adding to clouds more clouds with his deep sighs .
Dost thou not bring me letters from the friar ?
That "may be" must be , love , on Thursday next .
Do you not see that I am out of breath ?
You lie .
But come , young waverer , come , go with me , In one respect I'll thy assistant be , For this alliance may so happy prove To turn your households ' rancor to pure love .
I am the greatest , able to do least , Yet most suspected , as the time and place Doth make against me , of this direful murder .
Or , if sour woe delights in fellowship And needly will be ranked with other griefs , Why followed not , when she said "Tybalt's dead , " "Thy father" or "thy mother , " nay , or both , Which modern lamentations might have moved ?
Tomorrow night look that thou lie alone .
You say you do not know the lady's mind .
And yet no further than a wanton's bird , That lets it hop a little from his hand Like a poor prisoner in his twisted gyves , And with a silken thread plucks it back again , So loving-jealous of his liberty .
Oh , thou wilt speak again of banishment .
Romeo , come forth .
Come , we burn daylight , ho !
Marry , I remember it well .
Here's goodly gear .
What say you ?
Gentlemen , can any of you tell me where I may find the young Romeo ?
But , like a misbehaved and sullen wench , Thou pout'st upon thy fortune and thy love .
I beg for justice , which thou , Prince , must give .
Younger than you Here in Verona , ladies of esteem Are made already mothers .
Do you quarrel , sir ?
I will say for you .
You are too hot .
Commend me to your daughter .
Heaven and yourself Had part in this fair maid .
What's this ?
The excuse that thou dost make in this delay Is longer than the tale thou dost excuse .
Hath Romeo slain himself ?
It is some meteor that the sun exhales To be to thee this night a torchbearer , And light thee on thy way to Mantua .
And sometime comes she with a tithe-pig's tail Tickling a parson's nose as he lies asleep , Then he dreams of another benefice .
And there she shall at Friar Lawrence ' cell Be shrived and married .
Here's drink .
Nay , as they dare .
Of love ?
The strangers all are gone .
I do bite my thumb , sir .
And all the better is it for the maid .
Well , Susan is with God .
Let me be put to death .
Death , that hath sucked the honey of thy breath , Hath had no power yet upon thy beauty .
If good , thou shamest the music of sweet news By playing it to me with so sour a face .
Romeo slew him ; he slew Mercutio .
Where is my mother ?
A dog of that house shall move me to stand .
Why Romeo , art thou mad ?
But one , poor one , one poor and loving child , But one thing to rejoice and solace in , And cruel death hath catched it from my sight !
O me , O me !
Now , by Saint Peter's Church and Peter too , He shall not make me there a joyful bride .
Here all eyes gaze on us .
Nor tears nor prayers shall purchase out abuses , Therefore use none .
Come , vial .
Alas , my liege , my wife is dead tonight .
You shall find me apt enough to that , sir , an you will give me occasion .
The law that threatened death becomes thy friend And turns it to exile , there art thou happy .
Romeo , away , be gone !
Good Romeo , hide thyself .
O serpent heart hid with a flowering face !
Comfort me .
What says Romeo ?
We found him in the churchyard .
Thy wit is a very bitter sweeting .
How shall that faith return again to earth , Unless that husband send it me from heaven By leaving earth ?
Is my father well ?
Now must I to the monument alone .
Where is she ?
Why , such is love's transgression .
Tybalt , the reason that I have to love thee Doth much excuse the appertaining rage To such a greeting .
Come hither , man .
Away , Tybalt .
How , will she none ?
Amen , amen .
I have a head , sir , that will find out logs , And never trouble Peter for the matter .
Why , love , I say .
To answer that , I should confess to you .
She is too fair , too wise , wisely too fair , To merit bliss by making me despair .
He is hid at Lawrence ' cell .
How fares my Juliet ?
My sword , I say !
Verona's summer hath not such a flower .
Come you to make confession to this Father ?
But I am sent to find those persons whose names are here writ , and can never find what names the writing person hath here writ .
And where the worser is predominant , Full soon the canker death eats up that plant .
Thou dost not mark me .
For doting , not for loving , pupil mine .
You are looked for and called for , asked for and sought for , in the great chamber .
The heavens do lour upon you for some ill. Move them no more by crossing their high will .
Oh , he's a lovely gentleman .
Well , we were born to die .
By my count , I was your mother much upon these years That you are now a maid .
Thou wilt fall backward when thou comest to age .
Thou wast never with me for anything when thou wast not there for the goose .
O Tybalt , Tybalt , the best friend I had !
She's dead , deceased , she's dead .
Out upon you !
Marry , that , I think , be young Petruchio .
This can not anger him .
Be trusty , and I'll quit thy pains .
Oh , much I fear some ill unthrifty thing .
Peter !
If I may trust the flattering truth of sleep , My dreams presage some joyful news at hand .
Need you my help ?
Here's one , a friend , and one that knows you well .
Thou canst not speak of that thou dost not feel .
Who now the price of his dear blood doth owe ?
Hast thou slain Tybalt ?
Speak but one rhyme , and I am satisfied .
And trust me , love , in my eye so do you .
For shame , bring Juliet forth .
The date is out of such prolixity .
Switch and spurs , switch and spurs , or I'll cry a match .
The most you sought was her promotion , For 'twas your heaven she should be advanced .
Tis but thy name that is my enemy .
If love be rough with you , be rough with love .
Why , bride !
Both with an Ah , mocker , that's the dog's name .
Marry , I will , and this is wisely done .
Madam , good night .
I'll look to like if looking liking move .
An he speak any thing against me , I'll take him down , an he were lustier than he is , and twenty such Jacks .
Despised , distressed , hated , martyred , killed !
Come forth , thou fearful man .
Peter , stay at the gate .
It is a most sharp sauce .
How now ?
In love ?
Tell me , that I may sack The hateful mansion .
What , drawn , and talk of peace ?
The Prince will doom thee death If thou art taken .
Do not say "banishment." Hence from Verona art thou banished .
Go , then , for 'tis in vain To seek him here that means not to be found .
Good gentle youth , tempt not a desperate man .
I serve as good a man as you .
Oh , she doth teach the torches to burn bright !
This is the truth , or let Benvolio die .
Hence will I to my ghostly friar's close cell , His help to crave and my dear hap to tell .
Thou art like one of those fellows that , when he enters the confines of a tavern , claps me his sword upon the table and says "God send me no need of thee ! " and , by the operation of the second cup , draws it on the drawer when indeed there is no need .
Go ask his name. , If he be married .
But to be frank , and give it thee again .
Tomorrow will I send .
Romeo slew Tybalt .
when 'twas a little prating thing. , Oh , there is a nobleman in town , one Paris , that would fain lay knife aboard , but she , good soul , had as lief see a toad , a very toad , as see him .
O cousin , cousin !
Look thou but sweet , And I am proof against their enmity .
Give me my sin again .
Younger than she are happy mothers made .
Thy face is mine , and thou hast slandered it .
Oh , what learning is !
If love be blind , love can not hit the mark .
Out , you green sickness , carrion !
She's dead , she's dead , she's dead !
Good night .
So that my speed to Mantua there was stayed .
For , hark you , Tybalt being slain so late , It may be thought we held him carelessly , Being our kinsman , if we revel much .
I'll find Romeo To comfort you .
My bounty is as boundless as the sea , My love as deep .
How long hath he been there ?
Ha , ha .
Haply some poison yet doth hang on them , To make me die with a restorative .
Yet let me weep for such a feeling loss .
Therefore we'll have some half a dozen friends , And there an end .
Tis late .
Old Montague is come , And flourishes his blade in spite of me .
Every one prepare To follow this fair corse unto her grave .
But I'll amerce you with so strong a fine That you shall all repent the loss of mine .
This sight of death is as a bell , That warns my old age to a sepulcher .
Groan !
My master's .
What should it be that is so shrieked abroad ?
To supper ?
What is it else ?
My noble uncle , do you know the cause ?
There lies the man , slain by young Romeo , That slew thy kinsman , brave Mercutio .
Mistress !
Gentle Mercutio , put thy rapier up .
What can he say in this ?
As I did sleep under this yew tree here , I dreamt my master and another fought , And that my master slew him .
Either thou or I , or both , must go with him .
Wilt thou be gone ?
Look , sir , here comes the lady toward my cell .
What , are you busy , ho ?
Madam .
They have made worms ' meat of me .
I hate the word , As I hate hell , all Montagues , and thee .
She that makes dainty , She , I'll swear , hath corns .
Th ' exchange of thy love's faithful vow for mine .
I am not I if there be such an Or those eyes shut that makes thee answer "ay." If he be slain , say "ay , " or if not , "no." Brief sounds determine of my weal or woe .
Well , in that hit you miss .
Where is my Romeo ?
She hath , and in that sparing makes huge waste , For beauty , starved with her severity , Cuts beauty off from all posterity .
I'll find out your man , And he shall signify from time to time Every good hap to you that chances here .
But sadly , tell me who .
Oh , think'st thou we shall ever meet again ?
And , pretty fool , it stinted and said "ay." Enough of this .
What , wilt thou wash him from his grave with tears ?
And badest me bury love .
Now do you know the reason of this haste .
Alive in triumph , and Mercutio slain !
Well , sir .
No , sir .
I'll go alone .
What unaccustomed cause procures her hither ?
Who calls so loud ?
Vile earth , to earth resign .
A right good markman !
O mischief , thou art swift To enter in the thoughts of desperate men !
Oh , here's a wit of cheveril , that stretches from an inch narrow to an ell broad !
By my troth , it is well said .
Here's Romeo's man .
I'll tell thee ere thou ask it me again .
I speak no treason .
Romeo !
I'll go along , no such sight to be shown , But to rejoice in splendor of mine own .
Good morrow , Father .
I'll be with thee straight .
I will go along .
What counterfeit did I give you ?
Why , what is Tybalt ?
Let him alone .
Thou know'st my daughter's of a pretty age .
I pray thee , chide not .
Now I'll tell you without asking .
Have at thee , coward !
There lies that Tybalt .
How oft tonight Have my old feet stumbled at graves ! , Who's there ?
And she's fair I love .
What must be shall be .
Good morrow , cousin .
So thrive my soul , A thousand times good night !
Scurvy knave !
Therefore he that can not lick his fingers goes not with me .
Let's see for means .
Sleep dwell upon thine eyes , peace in thy breast .
I will come again .
O comfortable Friar !
What of that ?
How silver-sweet sound lovers ' tongues by night , Like softest music to attending ears !
One , gentlewoman , that God hath made , himself to mar .
He'll fright you up , i ' faith .
Romeo's a dishclout to him .
Here comes my man .
Then I will give you the serving creature .
Well , well , thou hast a careful father , child .
O most wicked fiend !
Life , living , all is Death's .
I will hence tonight .
And art thou changed ?
Towards him I made , but he was 'ware of me And stole into the covert of the wood .
I will be gone , sir , and not trouble you .
A conduit , girl ?
Oh , then , I see Queen Mab hath been with you .
O woeful time .
I can read .
I can tell you , but young Romeo will be older when you have found him than he was when you sought him .
Let me stand here till thou remember it .
Her blood is settled , and her joints are stiff .
Thou wast the prettiest babe that e'er I nursed .
Good night , good night !
Wilt thou provoke me ?
Oh , thou art deceived .
Ye say honestly .
What , still in tears , Evermore showering ?
Go .
Farewell ! , God knows when we shall meet again .
O , teach me how I should forget to think !
These times of woe afford no time to woo .
O God , she comes. , O honey Nurse , what news ?
I am for you .
With another , for tying his new shoes with old ribbon ?
Faith , I know not what to say .
Tis all one .
I mean , an we be in choler , we'll draw .
Speak not .
A gentleman , Nurse , that loves to hear himself talk , and will speak more in a minute than he will stand to in a month .
O wife , look how our daughter bleeds !
What , art thou hurt ?
But with a rearward following Tybalt's death , "Romeo is banished." To speak that word , Is father , mother , Tybalt , Romeo , Juliet , All slain , all dead .
Where's Potpan , that he helps not to take away ?
No , coz , I rather weep .
What , ho !
But what say you to Thursday ?
I pray thee , good Mercutio , let's retire .
You'll be sick tomorrow For this night's watching .
On Thursday , sir ?
What , shall I groan and tell thee ?
Anon !
Within the infant rind of this small flower Poison hath residence and medicine power .
As I discern , It burneth in the Capels ' monument .
It did , it did .
But now I'll tell thee joyful tidings , girl .
Death is my heir .
Confusion's cure lives not In these confusions .
That "banished , " that one word "banished" Hath slain ten thousand Tybalts .
And private in his chamber pens himself , Shuts up his windows , locks fair daylight out , And makes himself an artificial night .
Flies may do this , but I from this must fly .
Shall I believe That unsubstantial death is amorous , And that the lean abhorred monster keeps Thee here in dark to be his paramour ?
Be brisk 0awhile , and the longer liver take all .
Oh , that she knew she were !
God ye good e'en , fair gentlewoman .
Young son , it argues a distempered head So soon to bid good morrow to thy bed .
I am sped .
Where are the vile beginners of this fray ?
And yet I wish but for the thing I have .
But woo her , gentle Paris , get her heart .
Romeo shall thank thee , daughter , for us both .
The day is broke .
Romeo can , Though heaven can not .
How canst thou try them so ?
Is 't so , indeed ?
Cheerly , boys .
O life !
I know not .
This is the place .
A lantern , slaughtered youth , For here lies Juliet , and her beauty makes This vault a feasting presence full of light .
I would I were thy bird .
But all this did I know before .
Was that my father that went hence so fast ?
O calm dishonourable , vile submission !
Do you bite your thumb at us , sir ?
Her eye discourses .
Talk no more .
Hast thou not a word of joy ?
Why , how now , Juliet ?
That's not so .
What wouldst thou have with me ?
I wonder at this haste , that I must wed Ere he , that should be husband , comes to woo .
I see that thou art poor .
O fortune , fortune !
Away with the joint-stools , remove the court-cupboard , look to the plate .
Poor living corse , closed in a dead man's tomb !
It is too rough , Too rude , too boisterous , and it pricks like thorn .
I ' faith , I am sorry that thou art not well .
We talk here in the public haunt of men .
But I pray , can you read anything you see ?
Faith , I can tell her age unto an hour .
Ay , by my troth , the case may be amended .
Under love's heavy burden do I sink .
Ascend her chamber , hence , and comfort her .
I beseech thee , youth , Put not another sin upon my head By urging me to fury .
But thou art not quickly moved to strike .
I would thou wert so happy by thy stay To hear true shrift. , Come , madam , let's away .
I will be brief , for my short date of breath Is not so long as is a tedious tale .
Who bare my letter , then , to Romeo ?
God shield I should disturb devotion ! , Juliet , on Thursday early will I rouse ye .
Farewell .
Now is he for the numbers that Petrarch flowed in .
I'll to dinner .
Ah sir , ah sir .
We waste our lights in vain , like lights by day .
Go thy ways , wench .
To prison , eyes , ne'er look on liberty .
My words would bandy her to my sweet love , And his to me .
Then weep no more .
Dead art thou !
Tybalt would kill thee , But thou slew'st Tybalt , there art thou happy .
The hurt can not be much .
Pitiful sight !
An you be mine , I'll give you to my friend .
Go , sirrah , trudge about Through fair Verona .
What's he that now is going out of door ?
Let me be satisfied .
If e'er thou wast thyself and these woes thine , Thou and these woes were all for Rosaline .
Why dost thou wring thy hands ?
I will not budge for no man's pleasure , I .
We took this mattock and this spade from him As he was coming from this churchyard's side .
Then she is well , and nothing can be ill .
I pray thee , hold thy peace .
But new struck nine .
As if that name , Shot from the deadly level of a gun , Did murder her , as that name's cursed hand Murdered her kinsman .
My naked weapon is out .
Most detestable Death , by thee beguiled , By cruel , cruel thee quite overthrown !
Help me into some house , Benvolio , Or I shall faint .
Thou chid'st me oft for loving Rosaline .
Call , good Mercutio .
Fear comes upon me .
Not I , unless the breath of heartsick groans , Mistlike , infold me from the search of eyes .
Behind the abbey wall Within this hour my man shall be with thee And bring thee cords made like a tackled stair , Which to the high top-gallant of my joy Must be my convoy in the secret night .
Even such delight Among fresh fennel buds shall you this night Inherit at my house .
I would not for the world they saw thee here .
Sole monarch of the universal earth , Oh , what a beast was I to chide at him !
Did ever dragon keep so fair a cave ?
Therefore , farewell .
Two such opposed kings encamp them still , In man as well as herbs , grace and rude will .
Some comfort , Nurse .
Lo , here upon thy cheek the stain doth sit Of an old tear that is not washed off yet .
How sweet is love itself possessed When but love's shadows are so rich in joy !
More light and light , more dark and dark our woes !
Go tell him of this .
Do not answer me .
Romeo !
God ye good morrow , gentlemen .
That dreamers often lie .
What man art thou that , thus bescreened in night , So stumblest on my counsel ?
But old folks , many feign as they were dead , Unwieldy , slow , heavy , and pale as lead .
I hear some noise .
My child , my only life , Revive , look up , or I will die with thee ! , Help , help !
If they do see thee they will murder thee .
You will not then ?
My lord , I would that Thursday were tomorrow .
Perhaps you have learned it without book .
Muffle me , night , awhile .
I am afeard , Being in night , all this is but a dream , Too flattering sweet to be substantial .
Run to the Capulets .
Here's such a coil .
Welcome , gentlemen !
Thy head is as full of quarrels as an egg is full of meat , and yet thy head hath been beaten as addle as an egg for quarreling .
I am content , so thou wilt have it so .
No , 'tis not so deep as a well nor so wide as a church-door , but 'tis enough , 'twill serve .
They are free men , but I am banished .
Then have at you with my wit .
What a man are you ?
Two , two , a shirt and a smock .
What if this mixture do not work at all ?
What's this ?
Thursday is near .
Thou know'st my lodging .
You must contrary me .
This wind you talk of , blows us from ourselves .
In bed asleep while they do dream things true .
I will bite my thumb at them , which is a disgrace to them , if they bear it .
Do as thou wilt , for I have done with thee .
What of that ?
They stumble that run fast .
What , art thou drawn among these heartless hinds ?
Tell me , daughter Juliet , How stands your disposition to be married ?
Thou , wretched boy , that didst consort him here Shalt with him hence .
You'll not endure him !
Monday !
Long love doth so .
Oh , he is even in my mistress ' case , Just in her case .
Where should she be ?
You take your pennyworths now .
So shalt thou show me friendship .
Hark ye , your Romeo will be here at night .
I must another way To fetch a ladder , by the which your love Must climb a bird's nest soon when it is dark .
And we mean well in going to this mask , But 'tis no wit to go .
Ay , ay , the cords .
Oh , here Will I set up my everlasting rest , And shake the yoke of inauspicious stars From this world-wearied flesh .
Where shall we dine ? , O me !
I'll not be forsworn .
This is well .
Doth not Ay , Nurse , what of that ?
For naught so vile that on the earth doth live But to the earth some special good doth give .
Tybalt is dead , and Romeo banished."
For Juliet's sake , for her sake , rise and stand .
By my heel , I care not .
Ay , madam , from the reach of these my hands .
I am hurt .
This night I hold an old accustomed feast , Whereto I have invited many a guest Such as I love .
What early tongue so sweet saluteth me ?
Too swift arrives as tardy as too slow .
What devil art thou that dost torment me thus ?
With Rosaline , my ghostly Father ?
I neither know it nor can learn of him .
I have forgot why I did call thee back .
We'll to dinner , thither .
Some say the lark makes sweet division .
Why , that same pale hard-hearted wench , that Rosaline , Torments him so , that he will sure run mad .
She's not fourteen .
Tis more , 'tis more .
Alas the day , it did .
Give me leave awhile .
Even or odd , of all days in the year , Come Lammas Eve at night shall she be fourteen .
Nay , he will answer the letter's master , how he dares , being dared .
Will you tell me that ?
From forth the fatal loins of these two foes A pair of star-crossed lovers take their life , Whose misadventured piteous overthrows Doth with their death bury their parents ' strife .
What , ho ?
Tis well thou art not fish .
Is she not proud ?
O flesh , flesh , how art thou fishified !
Ay , a thousand times. , Peter !
And she as much in love , her means much less To meet her new beloved anywhere .
Tis no less , I tell you , for the bawdy hand of the dial is now upon the prick of noon .
Take no note of him .
Here is a friar that trembles , sighs and weeps .
And joy comes well in such a needy time .
Buy food , and get thyself in flesh. , Come , cordial and not poison , go with me To Juliet's grave , for there must I use thee .
And what to ?
Can heaven be so envious ?
Why , uncle , 'tis a shame .
Stay not , be gone .
Well , Juliet , I will lie with thee tonight .
Is it e'en so ?
It is my lady .
It is , it is .
Thou wilt quarrel with a man for cracking nuts , having no other reason but because thou hast hazel eyes .
An I might live to see thee married once , I have my wish .
Acquaint her here of my son Paris ' love , And bid her , mark you me , on Wednesday next , But , soft !
Fear me not .
A man , young lady !
Now art thou Romeo .
There rust and let me die .
O God , did Romeo's hand shed Tybalt's blood ?
I'll to my rest .
Make haste , make haste , sirrah .
Alack the day .
Hence "banished" is banished from the world , And world's exile is death .
Look , look .
This dagger hath mista'en , for , lo , his house Is empty on the back of Montague , And it mis-sheathed in my daughter's bosom .
This same should be the voice of Friar John .
These are news indeed !
How hast thou the heart , Being a divine , a ghostly confessor , A sin-absolver , and my friend professed , To mangle me with that word "banished" ?
To move is to stir , and to be valiant is to stand .
And if I can not , I'll find those that shall .
Bliss be upon you !
I bring thee tidings of the Prince's doom .
Or if not so , then here I hit it right : Our Romeo hath not been in bed tonight .
More validity , More honorable state , more courtship lives In carrion flies than Romeo .
A madness most discreet , A choking gall , and a preserving sweet .
Death lies on her like an untimely frost Upon the sweetest flower of all the field .
I like it not .
Your houses !
Where is my lord ?
O Friar , the damned use that word in hell .
The boy gives warning something doth approach .
Uncomfortable time , why camest thou now To murder , murder our solemnity ?
How well my comfort is revived by this !
If in thy wisdom thou canst give no help , Do thou but call my resolution wise , And with this knife I'll help it presently .
Send for the county .
Unhappy fortune !
A thousand times the worse to want thy light .
Then hie you hence to Friar Lawrence's cell .
A plague o ' both your houses !
Howling attends it .
I have an interest in your hearts ' proceeding .
How art thou out of breath when thou hast breath To say to me that thou art out of breath ?
Come , what says Romeo ?
I have it , And soundly too .
Come , come , thou art as hot a Jack in thy mood as any in Italy , and as soon moved to be moody , and as soon moody to be moved .
I dare not , sir .
Search , seek , and know how this foul murder comes .
Or , if his mind be writ , give me his letter .
Therefore thy earliness doth me assure Thou art uproused by some distemperature .
Why the devil came you between us ?
That is because the traitor murderer lives .
Tis no time to play now .
Lie thou there .
Go with me to the vault .
This , by his voice , should be a Montague. , What , dares the slave Come hither , covered with an antic face , To fleer and scorn at our solemnity ?
This doth not so , for she divideth us .
What said my man , when my betossed soul Did not attend him as we rode ?
Conceit , more rich in matter than in words , Brags of his substance , not of ornament .
Do you bite your thumb at us , sir ?
O my brother's child !
Twas no need , I trow , To bid me trudge .
We'll keep no great ado , a friend or two .
Not proud you have , but thankful that you have .
I will , and know her mind early tomorrow .
The sweeter rest was mine .
But let them measure us by what they will .
Right glad I am he was not at this fray .
Three words , dear Romeo , and good night indeed .
Thy drugs are quick .
Look , and thou shalt see .
Therefore thy kinsmen are no stop to me .
Brother , ho !
I know not , sir .
Not a dump , we .
God mark thee to his grace !
Delay this marriage for a month , a week .
A merry whoreson , ha !
And here I stand , both to impeach and purge , Myself condemned and myself excused .
Where is my father and my mother , Nurse ?
Yon light is not daylight , I know it , I .
Do not deny to him that you love me .
Ready to go , but never to return .
Day , night , hour , tide , time , work , play , Alone , in company , still my care hath been To have her matched .
Marry , come up , I trow .
Wednesday is tomorrow .
O happy dagger , This is thy sheath .
Death , that hath ta'en her hence to make me wail , Ties up my tongue and will not let me speak .
In sadness , cousin , I do love a woman .
Therefore , have done .
But by and by comes back to Romeo , Who had but newly entertained revenge , And to 't they go like lightning , for ere I Could draw to part them was stout Tybalt slain .
O God ! , O Nurse , how shall this be prevented ?
Now , by my maidenhead at twelve year old I bade her come .
Scurvy knave !
Therefore love moderately .
O love !
Then I defy you , stars !
As mine on hers , so hers is set on mine , And all combined , save what thou must combine By holy marriage .
Come , night .
Nurse ?
I drew to part them .
A right fair mark , fair coz , is soonest hit .
Poison , I see , hath been his timeless end. , O churl , drunk all , and left no friendly drop To help me after ?
God in heaven bless her !
Some grief shows much of love , But much of grief shows still some want of wit .
Thou wouldst else have made thy tale large .
An thou make minstrels of us , look to hear nothing but discords .
O , be gone !
Commend me to thy lady , And bid her hasten all the house to bed , Which heavy sorrow makes them apt unto .
But where hast thou been , then ?
Adieu , adieu !
Serve God .
I will then give it you soundly .
Lord , Lord , she will be a joyful woman .
Take thou that .
I beseech you , follow straight .
Therefore turn and draw .
Come , thou day in night , For thou wilt lie upon the wings of night Whiter than new snow upon a raven's back .
Why , is not this better now than groaning for love ?
Alack the day !
Romeo is coming .
Not having that which , having , makes them short .
Romeo ! , Alack , alack , what blood is this , which stains The stony entrance of the sepulcher ?
He made you for a highway to my bed , But I , a maid , die maiden-widowed .
It is the east , and Juliet is the sun .
I am peppered , I warrant , for this world .
Any man that can write may answer a letter .
The sun not yet thy sighs from heaven clears , Thy old groans ring yet in my ancient ears .
Get you to bed , faith .
Tybalt's death Was woe enough , if it had ended there .
It was .
Mercy but murders , pardoning those that kill .
O simple !
Holy Franciscan Friar !
News from Verona ! , How now , Balthasar ?
Good Father , I beseech you on my knees , Hear me with patience but to speak a word .
Ay me , what news ?
It is the lark that sings so out of tune , Straining harsh discords and unpleasing sharps .
Such comfort as do lusty young men feel When well-appareled April on the heel Of limping winter treads .
Wert thou as young as I , Juliet thy love , An hour but married , Tybalt murdered , Doting like me , and like me banished , Then mightst thou speak , then mightst thou tear thy hair And fall upon the ground , as I do now , Taking the measure of an unmade grave .
Give me those flowers .
Her body sleeps in Capels ' monument , And her immortal part with angels lives .
O God's lady dear , Are you so hot ?
Nay , I'll conjure too !
Come , stir , stir , stir !
Beshrew my very heart , I think you are happy in this second match , For it excels your first .
O lamentable day !
That I ask again , For nothing can be ill if she be well .
And is it not well served into a sweet goose ?
His son is elder , sir .
Boy , this shall not excuse the injuries That thou hast done me .
I will kiss thy lips .
How doth my lady ?
Hie you , make haste , for it grows very late .
Speakest thou from thy heart ?
Be merciful , say "death , " For exile hath more terror in his look , Much more than death .
Draw thy tool !
Sweet , sweet , sweet Nurse , tell me , what says my love ?
A plague o ' both your houses !
Romeo , will you come to your father's ?
Up .
Dost thou love me ?
Both our remedies Within thy help and holy physic lies .
Now art thou sociable .
He was not born to shame .
The cords That Romeo bid thee fetch ?
Henceforward do your messages yourself .
For , I am sure , you have your hands full all In this so sudden business .
Brother , I'll go and bring it thee .
Dear love , adieu. , Anon , good Nurse ! , Sweet Montague , be true .
Whence come you ?
Ah , welladay !
You are to blame , my lord , to rate her so .
That same villain , Romeo .
She was too good for me .
Anon !
Let us take the law of our sides .
Within this three hours will fair Juliet wake .
Never was seen so black a day as this .
Not mad , but bound more than a madman is , Shut up in prison , kept without my food , Whipped and tormented and , Good e'en , good fellow .
Wilt thou not , Jule ? " It stinted and said "ay." And stint thou too , I pray thee , Nurse , say I .
She will indite him to some supper .
Do as I bid thee , go .
But where unbruised youth with unstuffed brain Doth couch his limbs , there golden sleep doth reign .
To our house .
If all else fail , myself have power to die .
Spakest thou of Juliet ?
He is not the flower of courtesy , but , I'll warrant him , as gentle as a lamb .
I saw her laid low in her kindred's vault And presently took post to tell it you .
Then will I lay the serving creature's dagger on your pate .
Death's the end of all .
I dreamt a dream tonight .
I am the youngest of that name , for fault of a worse .
What satisfaction canst thou have tonight ?
My nyas ?
Dove-feathered raven , wolvish-ravening lamb !
Then , window , let day in and let life out .
Benvolio , who began this bloody fray ?
What is her mother ?
Indeed , I never shall be satisfied With Romeo , till I behold him , dead , Is my poor heart for a kinsman vexed .
Now , fellow , What is there ?
I will confess to you that I love him .
Young Romeo is it ?
Where the devil should this Romeo be ?
Without his roe , like a dried herring .
I have .
They call for dates and quinces in the pastry .
Have you importuned him by any means ?
Men's eyes were made to look and let them gaze .
Art thou not Romeo , and a Montague ?
Give me , give me !
Take it in what sense thou wilt .
Rest you merry !
Who is it ?
Utter your gravity o'er a gossip's bowl , For here we need it not .
Or shall we on without apology ?
My wits faints .
Well , thou hast comforted me marvelous much .
What , are you mad ?
Forget to think of her .
One knocks .
Make haste , lest mine be about your ears ere it be out .
Romeo must not live .
Alack the day !
He ran this way and leapt this orchard wall .
I will bite thee by the ear for that jest .
Nurse , where's my daughter ?
Zounds , a dog , a rat , a mouse , a cat to scratch a man to death !
I protest unto thee , Good heart , and i ' faith , I will tell her as much .
Why dost thou stay ?
To wreak the love I bore my cousin Upon his body that slaughtered him !
Appear thou in the likeness of a sigh !
You tallow face !
You shall have none ill , sir , for I'll try if they can lick their fingers .
Go waken Juliet .
O , wilt thou leave me so unsatisfied ?
Ay , boy , ready .
Now , ere the sun advance his burning eye , The day to cheer and night's dank dew to dry , I must upfill this osier cage of ours With baleful weeds and precious-juiced flowers .
Need and oppression starveth in thine eyes .
I am not for this ambling .
Nurse , will you go with me into my closet To help me sort such needful ornaments As you think fit to furnish me tomorrow ?
Her eye in heaven Would through the airy region stream so bright That birds would sing and think it were not night .
Speak , nephew .
She hath not seen the change of fourteen years .
I'll not to bed tonight .
This is she , Peace , peace , Mercutio , peace !
Find thou the means , and I'll find such a man .
Ay , let the county take you in your bed .
Thy wild acts denote The unreasonable fury of a beast .
Proud , " and "I thank you , " and "I thank you not , " And yet "not proud" ?
Nay , that's not so .
Didst thou not fall out with a tailor for wearing his new doublet before Easter ?
Riddling confession finds but riddling shrift .
Talk not to me , for I'll not speak a word .
Tell me , good my friend , What torch is yond that vainly lends his light To grubs and eyeless skulls ?
Take up those cords. , Poor ropes , you are beguiled , Both you and I , for Romeo is exiled .
The fearful passage of their death-marked love And the continuance of their parents ' rage , Which , but their children's end , naught could remove , Is now the two hours ' traffic of our stage , The which , if you with patient ears attend , What here shall miss , our toil shall strive to mend .
O Romeo , Romeo , brave Mercutio is dead !
How should they , when that wise men have no eyes ?
Why , she is within .
Where's Romeo ?
There is time enough .
Saints do not move , though grant for prayers ' sake .
Holy Saint Francis , what a change is here !
And to sink in it , should you burthen love , Too great oppression for a tender thing .
Here comes the furious Tybalt back again .
Say either , and I'll stay the circumstance .
Why , lady !
We can not be here and there too .
Go to , go to .
Give me thy hand .
Come , come away .
But saying o'er what I have said before .
That may be , sir , when I may be a wife .
The orchard walls are high and hard to climb , And the place death , considering who thou art , If any of my kinsmen find thee here .
Borrow Cupid's wings And soar with them above a common bound .
Look you , she loved her kinsman Tybalt dearly , And so did I .
Hast thou met with him ?
But no more deep will I endart mine eye Than your consent gives strength to make it fly .
It is an honor that I dream not of .
Wherefore art thou Romeo ?
Marry , my child , early next Thursday morn , The gallant , young , and noble gentleman , The County Paris , at Saint Peter's Church , Shall happily make thee there a joyful bride .
If my heart's dear love , Well , do not swear .
My child is yet a stranger in the world .
Oh , the people in the street cry "Romeo , " Some "Juliet , " and some "Paris , " and all run With open outcry toward our monument .
Hold , there is forty ducats .
Oh , so light a foot Will ne'er wear out the everlasting flint .
What with a torch !
Now , good sweet Nurse , O Lord , why look'st thou sad ?
O Lord , they fight !
O noble prince , I can discover all The unlucky manage of this fatal brawl .
Thus with a kiss I die .
Answer me like men .
Soft !
Saw you him today ?
Farewell !
Stay the friar too .
Tell me not , Friar , that thou hear'st of this , Unless thou tell me how I may prevent it .
I will follow you .
Said he not so ?
Let's talk .
Even so lies she , Blubbering and weeping , weeping and blubbering .
Faith , we may put up our pipes and be gone .
You are a saucy boy .
A pack of blessings light upon thy back , Happiness courts thee in her best array ,
I will carry no crotchets .
And when I shall die , Take him and cut him out in little stars , And he will make the face of heaven so fine That all the world will be in love with night And pay no worship to the garish sun .
And I'll still stay , to have thee still forget , Forgetting any other home but this .
Perchance she can not meet him .
Ah me !
Honest Nurse , farewell .
Smatter with your gossips , go .
Will you go to them ?
And , as he fell , did Romeo turn and fly .
Seal up the mouth of outrage for a while , Till we can clear these ambiguities And know their spring , their head , their true descent , And then will I be general of your woes , And lead you even to death .
No , not till Thursday .
Nay , an there were two such , we should have none shortly , for one would kill the other .
Alas , poor Romeo !
Sweet , so would I .
Is thy news good , or bad ?
But come what sorrow can , It can not countervail the exchange of joy That one short minute gives me in her sight .
I spoke with his man .
We are undone , lady , we are undone !
Ah , Juliet , if the measure of thy joy Be heaped like mine , and that thy skill be more To blazon it , then sweeten with thy breath This neighbor air , and let rich music's tongue Unfold the imagined happiness that both Receive in either by this dear encounter .
Either withdraw unto some private place , And reason coldly of your grievances , Or else depart .
What o'clock tomorrow Shall I send to thee ?
Madam , I am not well .
O God , I have an ill-divining soul .
O heavens !
Make haste , I say .
Care keeps his watch in every old man's eye , And where care lodges , sleep will never lie .
What , not a word ?
Beguiled , divorced , wronged , spited , slain !
Meantime I writ to Romeo , That he should hither come as this dire night , To help to take her from her borrowed grave , Being the time the potion's force should cease .
Tonight she is mewed up to her heaviness .
For himself to mar , " quoth he ?
Villain am I none .
I am none of his skains-mates .
Nay , gentlemen , prepare not to be gone .
You kiss by th ' book .
We'll to church tomorrow .
Go thither , and with unattainted eye Compare her face with some that I shall show , And I will make thee think thy swan a crow .
Then say at once what thou dost know in this .
Is Rosaline , whom thou didst love so dear , So soon forsaken ?
Let not the Nurse lie with thee in thy chamber .
You know not how to choose a man .
Well , what was yours ?
And weep ye now , seeing she is advanced Above the clouds , as high as heaven itself ?
Go , you cot-quean , go .
Then have my lips the sin that they have took .
Me they shall feel while I am able to stand , and 'tis known I am a pretty piece of flesh .
Some others search .
Can you not stay awhile ?
A grave ?
I am not here .
While we were interchanging thrusts and blows , Came more and more and fought on part and part , Till the Prince came , who parted either part .
Yet I can not choose but laugh To think it should leave crying and say "ay." And yet , I warrant , it had upon its brow A bump as big as a young cockerel's stone , A perilous knock , and it cried bitterly .
Young men's love then lies Not truly in their hearts , but in their eyes .
Couple it with something .
And then , I hope , thou wilt be satisfied .
I am too sore enpierced with his shaft To soar with his light feathers , and so bound , I can not bound a pitch above dull woe .
Ah , where's my man ? , Give me some aqua vitae. , These griefs , these woes , these sorrows make me old .
Come , I'll dispose of thee Among a sisterhood of holy nuns .
Whither ?
There stays a husband to make you a wife .
No , not he , though his face be better than any man's , yet his leg excels all men's , and for a hand and a foot and a body , though they be not to be talked on , yet they are past compare .
It is written , that the shoemaker should meddle with his yard and the tailor with his last , the fisher with his pencil and the painter with his nets .
Romeo will answer it .
O brother Montague , give me thy hand .
Now Romeo is beloved and loves again , Alike bewitched by the charm of looks , But to his foe supposed he must complain , And she steal love's sweet bait from fearful hooks .
Farewell .
Beat them down !
This shall determine that .
Two of the fairest stars in all the heaven , Having some business , do entreat her eyes To twinkle in their spheres till they return .
Blistered be thy tongue For such a wish !
Tybalt , the kinsman to old Capulet , Hath sent a letter to his father's house .
Or , if thou wilt , swear by thy gracious self , Which is the god of my idolatry , And I'll believe thee .
A greater power than we can contradict Hath thwarted our intents .
Farewell .
Answer to that .
Thou villain Capulet !
What cursed foot wanders this way tonight To cross my obsequies and true love's rite ?
Where I have learned me to repent the sin Of disobedient opposition To you and your behests , and am enjoined By holy Lawrence to fall prostrate here To beg your pardon .
Was ever book containing such vile matter So fairly bound ?
Well , sir , my mistress is the sweetest lady. , Lord , Lord !
Death is my son-in-law .
The world affords no law to make thee rich .
Come , come with me , and we will make short work .
What , shall this speech be spoke for our excuse ?
Is this the poultice for my aching bones ?
Stay , Tybalt , stay !
Be patient , for the world is broad and wide .
So shall you feel the loss , but not the friend Which you weep for .
I am none of his flirt-gills .
Will you speak well of him that killed your cousin ?
Cast it off !
On , lusty gentlemen .
I see thou know'st me not .
My back a ' t ' other side .
Here comes your father .
Thou , why , thou wilt quarrel with a man that hath a hair more or a hair less in his beard than thou hast .
Henceforth I never will be Romeo .
I was hurt under your arm .
Strike !
My soul , and not my child !
I think He told me Paris should have married Juliet .
Now comes the wanton blood up in your cheeks .
Madam , if you could find out but a man To bear a poison , I would temper it , That Romeo should , upon receipt thereof , Soon sleep in quiet .
Ha , banishment !
Would none but I might venge my cousin's death !
I'll go and chat with Paris .
Reply not .
Now God in heaven bless thee !
Farewell , farewell .
Down with the Capulets !
His son was but a ward two years ago .
What is the matter ?
But now , my lord , what say you to my suit ?
I will show myself a tyrant .
I will omit no opportunity That may convey my greetings , love , to thee .
What noise is this ?
Now is the sun upon the highmost hill Of this day's journey , and from nine till twelve Is three long hours , yet she is not come .
Where is my page ? , Go , villain , fetch a surgeon .
Thy Juliet is alive , For whose dear sake thou wast but lately dead , There art thou happy .
Clubs , bills , and partisans !
My leisure serves me , pensive daughter , now. , My lord , we must entreat the time alone .
Stay , fellow .
That last is true .
Let wantons light of heart Tickle the senseless rushes with their heels .
I do but keep the peace .
I anger her sometimes and tell her that Paris is the properer man .
Sometime she gallops o'er a courtier's nose , And then dreams he of smelling out a suit .
Ay , if I know the letters and the language .
Thou fond mad man , hear me a little speak .
I gave thee mine before thou didst request it , And yet I would it were to give again .
Your love says , like an honest gentleman , 'Where is your mother ?
My fan , Peter .
Am I come near ye now ? , Welcome , gentlemen !
Hence , and stand aloof .
Whither should they come ?
For what purpose , love ?
I met the youthful lord at Lawrence ' cell , And gave him what becomed love I might , Not stepping o'er the bounds of modesty .
Romeo , Romeo , Romeo !
Do so , and bid my sweet prepare to chide .
I pray , sir , can you read ?
Give me thy torch , boy .
When good manners shall lie all in one or two men's hands , and they unwashed too , 'tis a foul thing .
Sin from thy lips ?
I'll bury thee in a triumphant grave .
I tell you , he that can lay hold of her Shall have the chinks .
O Juliet , I already know thy grief .
Very well took , i ' faith , wisely , wisely .
Now heaven hath all ,
And so did I .
Marry , sir , because silver hath a sweet sound .
Good night .
Grief of my son's exile hath stopped her breath .
I'll send to one in Mantua , Where that same banished runagate doth live , Shall give him such an unaccustomed dram That he shall soon keep Tybalt company .
I do beseech you , sir , have patience .
Sojourn in Mantua .
That's a certain text .
Amen !
Oh , it is my love .
Romeo , he cries aloud , "Hold , friends !
An if thou couldst , thou couldst not make him live .
Sweet-heart !
But I will write again to Mantua , And keep her at my cell till Romeo come .
