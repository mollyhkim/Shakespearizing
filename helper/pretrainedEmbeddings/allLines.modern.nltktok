Maybe he's not feeling well .
Ensign , what's he doing in there ?
Let it go up to heaven .
Master Fer !
Your friend , Artemidorus." I'll stand here until Caesar passes by , and I'll give him this as though it's a petition .
Go wherever you want .
So why did you laugh when I said that men don't interest me ?
How did you sleep , my lord ?
It's too frightened to look at itself .
That's enough for one lesson .
You brazen whore !
Come on , sir .
For a while , no play was sold to the theaters without a big fight between the children's playwright and the actors playing adult roles .
He doesn't seem to be alive .
I think I've found one already , thanks to you , my lord .
No , I swear I'm not .
As surely as I am the queen of Egypt , Antony , you're blushing , which means you're Caesar's servant .
What a fine sight !
Also , he's left you all his walkways , in his private gardens and newly planted orchards , on this side of the Tiber River .
Have you heard something of her in your letters ?
I'll get it done right away .
You make me want to agree with the philosopher Pythagoras that animal souls are reincarnated in human bodies .
Run to your houses , fall on your knees , and pray to the gods to spare you the pain that you deserve for such ingratitude .
I thought the king preferred the Duke of Albany to the Duke of Cornwall .
Whoosh !
On land you keep the legions and cavalry together , don't you ?
I'll give you the title to that ship and its treasure .
He has to pay the price for his foolish actions .
I wish I could keep killing him for nine years straight .
In his greatest need , even they will desert him .
How is she ?
No doubt , but you may be going about it the wrong way , Neighbor , this gift is very gracious , I'm sure .
He would just see me for what I am , a person amazed to hear you talking about Naples .
Come on , come on .
Here , sir !
It's too late .
My noble lords and relatives , good morning .
As you please .
He's like a cowardly
So how's my nephew Hamlet doing ?
So , in God's name , let's march .
I'm sure you know him .
I'm going back into battle .
Please , don't mention her .
Oh , oh , oh , oh .
If that's what you say , go fight a duel with me and prove it .
Dear gods , bless this couple , since you're the ones who have shown us the path that led us here .
Give me the necklace !
Don't bring me any more reports .
Yes , I really think so .
Don't misunderstand me , sir .
Now all the late travellers are hurrying to reach their inns .
Tell her you heard us , and that she should sneak into the arbor where the crisscrossing branches overhead keep the honeysuckles out of the sun .
Tell me !
The Count Claudio will marry Leonato's daughter .
I think so too .
The gods protect him from so great a shame !
The dog returns to its own vomit , and the newly washed sow to its mud puddle." You'd take anything for a mistress .
But tell me this : don't you know my voice ?
After such a long period of grief , we will have such a celebration !
My letters are ready to go .
No way , then , I'll run .
I have a good plan .
Aren't the playwrights hurting them by making them upstage adult actors , which they are going to grow up and become ?
The oars were made of silver , and the oarsmen rowed in time to flute music .
I'll disguise myself as you and pour out "my" feelings to Hero , taking her prisoner with the force of my love story .
I thought everything out here was wild , which is why I acted so stern and commanding .
That's the way great men ought to endure great losses .
Look at the stars , see how the floor of heaven is inlaid with small disks of bright gold .
My brother , your uncle Antonio , just listen to this ( I still can't believe a brother could be so disloyal !
I will too .
Aren't you dead yet ?
You are what's left of the noblest man that ever lived .
Tell me one .
Good Prince , say something !
Who's there ?
I spoke angry , foul words to him , and with that I will kiss you .
What in the world do you call this , tailor !
Why are you so far from home ?
The Constable of France .
Tell me .
To , to , to , To murder me ?
As long as there are
I'm sure of that .
An Englishman ?
You call this sneering ?
That's a wise idea .
Come with me .
My lady ordered me to deliver her letter .
You're pale and trembling .
So , by heaven's decree , Rosalind Was composed Of different faces , eyes , and hearts , so that she might have the most prized touches of all .
You have bested many things , well don't try and best me .
Dolabella !
It's time to hide , wretched Margaret .
It looks that way .
I've done no more to Caesar than you will do to me .
I can't say "whore." It makes me sick to say the word even now .
I'll obey you until I can make bail .
Come here , Ariel .
I'm not like that now .
I don't care if you love me or not , I like the cap and I'll have it or I won't have any .
You bastards !
Come here , Catesby .
No , not tonight .
You can't do that .
Kind and dear princess !
I swear by this hand and my father's soul , the whole thing is a disaster .
Play me some music .
I'm proud to be Sir Rowland's son , his youngest son , and I would never change that , not even to be Frederick's adopted heir .
That's better than exaggerating our trust .
You must be crazy to say that !
Well , I'm sorry for you , gentle Silvius .
So it is on earth .
Be happy about it .
Once at Sardis and once last night , here in Philippi fields .
The queen and her elves will be here soon .
Gentlemen , let go of him .
I don't like it that you knew about this , Iago .
But how ?
Thank you .
If not , the Fates are on the side of the traitors .
Sir , I know you , and I trust you enough to share something very important with you .
Do tell .
Remember your children as being sweeter than they actually were , and think of the man who killed them as worse than he is .
It's not okay !
I can't believe my sister would neglect her obligations in any way .
For no man , sir .
Because it doesn't have eight ?
Oh no , my reasons are deep and as permanent as death .
Indeed ?
I wish you had told me you had a different father .
You saw my master wink and laugh at you ?
Gentle boy , good night .
Brutus speaks .
Is that a good idea , do you think ?
I've heard all about you women and your cosmetics too .
You've never thought of me like that , and you have no reason to .
The handkerchief !
Who takes care of them ?
But tell me , monsieur , what sport are the ladies missing ?
I'll test it out .
Farewell , kind master .
The things she has shamelessly hurled on me are beyond imagination .
Can a person be forgiven and still keep the fruits of his crime ?
Young boys and girls are equal to men .
I swear , I could do so much , Please , no more .
I do , Mark Antony .
The fire is ready .
Do you want to exchange fathers ?
If you don't repay me on the day we agree on , in the place we name , for the sum of money fixed in our contract , your penalty will be a pound of your pretty flesh , to be cut off and taken out of whatever part of your body I like .
How can you blame her , a tender young maiden still given to virgin blushes , for objecting to having a blind , naked boy appear before her ?
Your Majesty is quite right .
If you could please stop fooling around , I'll tell you what your mother wants .
Besides , he brings his fate with him .
I will either get you out , lying if I have to , or stay in prison in your place .
I swear , By nothing , because this is no oath .
Oh !
How can I describe you that will make you appeal to the young woman and will also agree with God , the law , my honor , and her feelings ?
And I'll go to bed at noon .
The gods forbid !
You have to be my torchbearer for the masquerade .
Right .
Yes , you are .
Tell me , you unknown power , He can read your thoughts .
A lover would have to be weepier , of course .
Does a madman scare me when he stares at me ?
Macbeth !
My lord , he wonders why you have assembled such troops of citizens to speak with him , since he had no idea they were coming .
Good to see you , Corporal Nym .
Well , sir , the gown is not for me .
Helena , it's not true .
I'm not that stupid .
Oh , are you really !
He's as brave as a fox .
Let him be for a bit .
Now , you tanned fieldworkers who are so tired of August's labors , get out of the dirt and come rejoice with us here .
You're a senator !
Well , that's really my job .
I'll think it over .
Don't you see my baby suckling at my breast so that its nurse will fall asleep ?
I'll bet any man who knows the law five shillings to one on it .
But mock me gently , dear Kate , because I love you terribly .
I wish you were someone else's son .
So you got what you deserved , and were locked up in this cave , which is more fitting for the likes of you than a prison would be .
Listen , boy !
What is his name ?
Watch me : stroke your chins and swear by your beards that I am a knave .
She's round , like a globe .
Coward !
I hope you have good weather to set your mind at ease .
Run , master , run .
Put on my crown .
The warships have sent a dozen messages tonight , one after the other , and many of the senators have been awakened and are at the Duke's already .
Oh , just see what happens after the pageantry is over !
In Sicyon .
Very wise .
If it's fighting he is after , some of us here should run and hide .
You should let others take care of you and submit to people who know better than you do what's good for you .
That's where hell is , and darkness , and fires and stench !
As old and white-haired as you are , and you're such a traitor ?
I want you .
I am sure , sweet Kate , this kindness deserves thanks .
I do not know that you are as good a man as myself .
And that necklace around his neck is the very one he swore he didn't have !
Why have your rosy cheeks faded so quickly ?
In the mud .
Oh , I wish I had my rosary !
A likely story !
You don't have more than half an hour to live .
Caesar , I'm telling you that Antony is dead .
Caesar is in a sober mood .
No , that's not it , it's because of what happens in the marriage bed .
Why are you adored ?
What's this !
The whole world could look at you , and no one would be as blind as he is , thinking you're beautiful .
Don't you care about me ?
Should we watch this ridiculous scene ?
Farewell to you both .
Now , my companions and brothers in exile , hasn't experience made this simple life sweeter than a life of glittery pomp and circumstance ?
Life's better at
I'm glad to see you .
The son ran away .
This way , we can see how the world moves .
Allow me to continue. , I am a gentleman of Verona , sir , who , hearing of your daughter's beauty and wit , her friendly disposition and bashful modesty , her uncommon virtues and her mild behavior , have taken the liberty of presenting myself as a guest at your house in the hope of seeing for myself if what I've heard is true .
My lord , it's news I wish I didn't have to report .
He's been captured or killed .
Stay here , Titinius .
Well , do whatever you think best .
Stand and fight , you overdressed servant , fight !
Have you both really given me up ?
What name , madam ?
Has anyone ever courted a woman in this state of mind ?
I'll be gentle and mild .
And that's true too .
Where have you sent the king ?
That's true .
And does this prospect of good fortune make you happy ?
Well , let's hope your good fortune continues !
Write them together , yours is just as good a name .
There was never a mother who suffered so much loss .
Tell me once more what you say .
Sit down and rest .
But it's enough to know that the day will end , and then the end will be known .
What did you mean by giving me this handkerchief ?
I'm sorry you don't have time. , Antonio , give this gentleman a reward .
And in a P.S .
Drown yourself ?
So you're telling me to give it time and wait for summer .
No , cousin , I'm going to Fife .
If you've been ordered back to Venice because of my father , don't blame me .
I should really leave right away .
It's nobler to leap in ourselves than dawdle until they push us .
Hello , brother Edmund .
But she , your subject , hates such a king .
She was worried about my absence , and about the fact that young Octavius and Mark Antony have grown so strong , which I found out at the same time as the news of her death .
Alas , you misunderstood everything !
I beg your pardon , sir , What did that guy say ?
Your vote will be as strong as anyone's in the reordering of the government .
You call it my " Don't you know ?
Brother Anthony ,
Now , if courtiers were shepherds , that kind of courtesy would be unclean .
Be content .
Will you come with me to hear this news , sir ?
Whose tongue ?
Am I your servant ?
But now they rise from the dead with twenty fatal head wounds and push us off our stools .
Therefore it's certain that he wasn't ambitious .
King Edward was going to marry Lady Lucy , your mother can vouch for that , and then he was betrothed to Bona , the King of France's sister-in-law .
That's a sin young men often commit because they allow their eyes to wander .
But you must learn to recognize such liars , or you will be greatly taken advantage of .
My honorable , reverend master ?
Benedick , Beatrice praised your wit the other day .
Antipholus , you hear how the man pleads with me .
There's no power in Venice that can change an established decree .
I think a few members of the court should fetch the young prince from Wales and bring him to London to be crowned our king .
There's other work for you to do .
I demand this in the name of all the saints in heaven .
No , by no means .
But if we have reasons that are strong enough to ignite cowards into action and to make weak women brave , and I think we do , then , countrymen , what else could we possibly need to spur us to action ?
And when that time comes , then you can mock me , but please don't pity me , because I won't pity you .
I don't think any woman like that exists .
But let him start off easy by killing one of us .
He uses his clownishness to disguise his deadly wit .
It's a shame that you walk the streets with all the honest men .
Tell him we could have driven him back at Harfleur but thought it unwise to burst a pustule before it had fully ripened .
Now come along .
The Lord Grandpre .
Cassio's killed a young Venetian named Roderigo .
Right now I'd give a thousand
Who has wronged him ?
Caesar wrote for him to come to Rome .
She had no food today and will have none .
I meant to say the Lord Protector .
With my eye sockets ?
Myself ?
Who should begin ?
Come , Vaughan .
No , some of it is about my child's father .
If you don't , if I'm left alone , I swear I'll have that legal expert as my bedfellow .
I won't leave him alone until he gives Cassio his job back. , How are you , my lord ?
Soldier , you must come to the king .
Oh , lovely .
Every heart in Rome loves and pities you .
A hundred then .
Good Macbeth , we're ready when you are .
Just as the ox has his yoke , the horse its bridle , the falcon a tether , a man has his desires , to keep in check .
Listen to me , you traitor .
Prove you are worthy of your birth , which I do not doubt for a moment .
That was me , but it's not me , I'm not ashamed to tell you what I once was , since I'm so happy to have since converted .
Sure , or anything else you show him .
With his ambition growing like this , do you hear what I'm saying ?
Indeed , you have wronged me , you liar .
Isn't that what they said ?
What a heavy sigh !
I hope luck will give me what my heart hopes for !
There's not a strand of feather left in our whole army , a good sign , I hope , that we won't fly away like birds , and time on the field has made us slovenly .
The prince has far outgrown me .
Has it come to this ?
So , goodbye .
Everything I am and everything I have now belongs to you .
I came here crying .
As a wandering lunatic , he can do whatever he wants .
Look , your wife is with him .
But in spite of all this , the man is still wealthy enough .
Let's all sink with the king .
Here is the cap your Worship ordered .
Here comes the noble Antony .
Here we'll shake hands good-bye .
Then he shook Bassanio's hand affectionately , and they separated .
Trebonius knows his cue .
I'll call it "Bottom's Dream" because it's so deep that it has no bottom .
My lord , I have some mementos of yours that I've been meaning to give back to you for a long time now .
Follow that gentleman now , and be careful not to make fun of him .
Those uncles that you wish were here were dangerous .
Now be quiet .
I'll fall at his feet and lie there until my pleading and crying convinces the duke to come here and force my husband to leave this abbey .
Ah , my poor princes !
So the pale , angry moon , who controls the tides , fills the air with diseases .
These are tricks of the imagination , and this place is filled with magicians .
Spoken like a brave man who respects his reputation .
Are you planning on showing me all your wit at once ?
Here come the lovers , laughing happily. , I wish you joy , my friends !
Her only flaw , and it's a big one , is that she's unbearable , a total witch , so much so that I wouldn't think of marrying her myself , not even if I were in a worse fix than I am , not for a whole goldmine .
Tell me , please : how many boys and girls will I have ?
It's like a cockleshell or a walnut shell , a joke , a prank , a doll's cap .
You're getting in the way of our work .
Get out of my sight !
The fact that this summer bird , the house martin , builds his nests here proves how inviting the breezes are .
No , madam .
Even my tears burn me like molten lead .
I mean , with my head in your lap ?
If it weren't for the fact that so many of our soldiers revolted and joined them , we could have met them out in front of the castle , man to man , and beaten them back to England .
piece of cheese will get him. , I challenge you to a match .
At that time you can smash in his skull after seizing his books ; or you can bash his skull with a log ; or you can stab him in the belly ; or cut his windpipe .
Your mother sends her blessings .
Come , here's some sauce to go with it .
And when some lowlife protests that Stop , and eat no more .
Listen to you !
My husband .
Heaven keep you safe !
I'll send my prayers with him .
The Phoenix is my house ?
People who want to start a big fire quickly start with little twigs .
No , it was a little one , not more than a pint .
No , you'll have to excuse me .
Just do it carefully. , And to think that the noble and loyal Kent has been banished , for the crime of telling the truth !
You expect me to cry ?
What , are you crazy ?
You lie .
Oh , control yourself , lady !
If I had the goddess Juno's power , I would make the strong-winged messenger , Mercury , pick you up and seat you beside Jove .
A sense of security opens the door to conspiracy .
Captain Macmorris , if you take my words in some way other than how they were meant , see , I'll have to think you're not treating me with the good will you ought to , see , since I am as good a man as yourself , both in the practice of war and in my country of origin and in other respects .
If we'd been able to put on our play , we would have had it made .
Her eyes are vicious , but yours are comforting .
Look for yourself , see the top of the cliff way up there ?
Yes , it's true .
Let's shake on it .
I'll give you mine .
If Cleopatra heard you , you would be well punished for your audacity .
The heart won't be reasoned with .
So have a seat and talk to her .
Well , that's a fine answer .
You don't know a thing !
She can't stand to hear about getting a husband .
All these quarrels are about me .
You come with me , uncle of Exeter .
Richard , the duke of Gloucester , is very dangerous , and the queen's sons and brothers are haughty and proud , it would be better for this ailing country if they were subjects , not rulers .
I'll hound him .
I will never be exhibited as lucky Caesar's prize .
Cheer up as much as you can .
Sir , I tell you we believe you're both lying criminals .
I won't either , sir .
What's she doing now ?
Sir , Octavius has already arrived in Rome .
Take Beatrice , have you come because I called for you ?
Go ahead .
He would never have spoken to me like this .
Go to my room and put on something of mine .
We're being haunted .
Oh noble lord , consider your lineage .
The humiliation is all mine .
I'll give the Queen a hearing and grant her requests if she either throws her dishonored friend out of Egypt or kills him .
Fulvia ?
What's going on here ?
Edmund , where's your wicked brother ?
If you don't need it for some important reason , then give it back to me .
Go to her and tell her for me .
Hardly , Kate .
Have a seat .
The fool's nice enough , but he's such a huge eater , and slow as a snail when he works .
You think my uncle was lying , grandmother ?
Should I perjure my soul by disobeying it ?
No , my good lord .
The earth has bubbles , just like the water , and these creatures must have come from a bubble in the earth .
Since the youth won't be reasoned with , he'll have to suffer for his stubbornness .
Nothing , but this is true .
Did he cry ?
And you have to cut this flesh from his chest .
He did this in public ?
Sorry , sir , Goodman Verges tends to ramble .
I'm the ghost of your father , doomed for a certain period of time to walk the earth at night , while during the day I'm trapped in the fires of purgatory until I've done penance for my past sins .
But don't delay .
What foreign lands has he conquered and captive foreigners chained to his chariot wheels ?
But as it stands , I wish I could believe it wasn't .
Let me finish my curse .
But leave it all to God .
Age hasn't dried up my body or eroded my intelligence so much , and luck hasn't robbed me of so much of my fortune , and my bad ways haven't deprived me of so many friends , that they won't find me ready to seek revenge both physically and mentally , with money and friends at my disposal .
Tell every soldier to break off a branch and hold it in front of him .
How What , are you jealous , Oberon ? , Fairies , let's get out of here .
Fool , do not flatter yourself .
Before you can say "Come" and "Go , " And breathe twice , and shout "So , so ! " Each one of your servants will rush here ,
Wait , don't stand next to each other .
What on earth does that mean ?
Hello , Tubal .
What will be my evidence ?
Two or three men are groaning .
Come , come , I know what you're referring to , Richard .
What kind of fighting cock is this ?
Pick up the corpses .
Do you know his plans ?
Why ?
So , in that case , tell me who's next in line to inherit the kingdom of Naples ?
Good idea .
Monster , I smell like horse piss , which is making my nose pretty upset .
None of these deranged rascals can shake me from my profession .
My wickedness ?
Why , a bad action is just a wrong in this world , but when you've won the whole world , it's a wrong in your own world , so you can make it right then .
Goodbye , sir .
The horsemen stand frozen like candlesticks , torches in their hands .
Then stay with us .
What are you going to do for her ?
And if he doesn't deserve this joy on earth , he'll never deserve it in heaven .
Master , do you really mean that ?
Let's go inside and we'll answer all your questions truthfully .
When we see that our betters have the same problems we do , we can almost forget our own misery .
Come on , then .
No , I think there's more to this than you're letting on .
That's what made him crazy .
Shylock , although I never lend or borrow with interest , I'm willing to break that habit to help a friend in need .
Get out of my sight .
Proculeius , Caesar has heard about what you've done here and has sent for you .
Goodbye .
That is , if we ever want to return to being rivals for Bianca's love .
If we don't obey them , they'll suck the life out of us or pinch us black and blue .
That's how sound a man you appeared .
Is Antonio here ?
Since the wall is conscious , it should curse back at him .
They're just fine , my dear madam .
You are your father's daughter .
Right now , my pressing business calls me away .
I've outshot you , and not for the first time .
You'll find I'll give it to you very willingly .
Thanks for letting me go .
But Macbeth is .
It turns kings into gods and men of lower rank into kings .
Yes , go ahead and moan , because you killed the sweetest , most innocent woman who ever lived !
Or was it just your whim , on your own initiative ?
I don't trust you .
A very nasty meaning .
I know him .
Calphurnia !
Please , my friend , give me all the news , both good and bad , at the same time .
What , Gertrude ?
Talk to him .
But how ?
If I'd been a god I would've let the sea sink inside the earth before it had a chance to swallow up that ship and all the people it was carrying .
Places , everyone !
We can not fight for love as men can .
We spend more time seeking out the fleeting glories of this temporary world than looking to the permanent grace of God !
Enough , gentlemen .
Let the dying fire shine a glimmering light throughout the house .
That's the way a good deed shines in a naughty world .
Insolent Oh , the good gods !
Very pale , sir .
Their villainy nauseates me , and I must therefore vomit it up .
My lord , we were sent for .
Let me work on him .
Caesar's knave will bring him a message for us .
Should I do it now ?
Who are you ?
A man of great influence .
You seem like a good judge .
She's beautiful , if my eyes can see .
To leave his wife , his children , his house , and his titles in a place so unsafe that he himself flees it !
No , he hasn't .
There it is .
I'll do all that .
I didn't realize he knew her .
Oh , my son , what issue is that ?
Less than a month after my father's death , even before the tears on her cheeks had dried , she remarried .
Then meet me right away at the notary's .
The poor thing , I really think she loves me .
Do you know any , Hero ?
You all saw that on the Lupercal feast day I offered him a king's crown three times , and he refused it three times .
To die for adultery ?
Except that he has not yet agreed to address you in this form and with this title , in French , And even this I'm willing to grant if you request it .
Take me to him .
I have a daughter .
I admit the cape .
Calphurnia , my wife , is keeping me at home .
So please , my sweet Rose , my dear Rose , be happy .
I tried to stop speaking plainly , since you dislike plain speech so much .
The whole town will riot !
Meanwhile , after you .
Take some memento from us as a token of our gratitude , not as a fee .
Keep this libertine occupied with endless debauchery .
I'd rather see you having fun , because we have friends coming who want to have fun .
Retreat further , my lord , retreat further .
My lord ?
Let's carve him up like a dish fit for the gods , not chop him up like a carcass fit for dogs .
What do you want me to do with this ?
Consider how poorly this reflects on me .
Sweet men , come to him .
Here .
Until recently , I was as unimportant to his affairs as the morning dew is to the wide ocean .
It's time to reassess the situation .
Do the deed that will make this island yours forever , and will make me , Caliban , your worshipful foot-licker .
Our arms , which can be strong and cruel , and our hearts , filled with brotherly love , embrace you with kind love , good thoughts , and reverence .
I didn't take any more pains bringing this message than you took pains in thanking me." That's like saying , "Any thing I do for you is as easy as saying 'thank you.'" If this doesn't move me to take pity on her , I'm a horrible person .
You're bleeding a lot .
You're using this as an excuse for not showing up at the Porcupine like you promised .
I won't deny you anything !
Please go away , both of you .
If Duncan bleeds I'll paint the servants ' faces with his blood .
I'm not possessed !
Their guilt is finally starting to gnaw at them , like a slow-acting poison .
Then surrender , coward , and we'll put you in a freakshow , just like they do with deformed animals .
Excellently , excellently .
Hermia is lucky , wherever she is , because she has beautiful eyes .
I'll do anything rather than marry a drunk , Nerissa .
The general and his wife are talking about it now , and she's defending you strongly .
He has killed me , Mother .
The king of England's approach is as forceful as a whirlpool .
But brother Anthony , Don't , it's no big deal .
Not explicitly , but so what ?
Don't think of any beauty But the beauty of Rosalind .
Come over here , gentlemen , and put your hands on my sword again .
It's still warm from the cut .
But if the cause is not just , the king himself will have a lot to answer for , when all those legs and arms and heads chopped off in battle shall join together on Judgment Day crying , "We died at such and such a place." Some will be swearing , some crying for a surgeon , some for the wives that are destitute without them , some about the debts they owed , some for their children left unprovided for .
I can't go any further .
Pompey has a strong navy .
I want my bond .
He was so slick in covering over his plans that if it hadn't been for his love affair with Shore's wife , I would never have suspected him .
He's not here .
What do you think you're doing ?
Some of them are leaning already .
That was good planning , and you'll sleep some more .
Call them .
Ma'am , I'd rather , I know your lady Goneril doesn't love her husband .
Goodbye .
Now , Titania , wake up , my sweet queen .
Because when rich villains need poor villains ' services , those poor ones can name the price .
Hey , you !
Who calls so coldly ?
And there were a hundred spooked women huddled together in fear who swore they saw men on fire walk up and down the streets .
Do you think you've won ?
Lunatics , lovers , and poets all are ruled by their overactive imaginations .
If she were so moral , she would never have fallen in love with the Moor in the first place .
Me neither .
I want you there and back again before I can even tell you what you should do there .
If you refuse me , the laws of Venice have no validity .
By the god Jupiter above , I swear "No." By Jupiter's wife Juno , I swear "Yes." They wouldn't dare .
May God's arm strike on our side !
Listen , Dardanius .
Thinking , my lord ?
If I can bear that pain , then I can bear my husband's secrets .
Oh , let us be merciful anyway .
Not in my husband's nose .
You're now within a foot of the cliff's edge .
I can't go any further , sir .
This box is too threatening .
I'll join you , sir .
You'll have to bear with me .
Sir , I'm puzzled by what you just said .
Why are you calling me "love" ?
It's shameful , and we have to make some changes right away .
Madam , he's well .
What do you want , fellow ?
Carry him to my best room , gently , so he doesn't wake , and hang all my erotic paintings around him .
I will catch up with you , Cleopatra , and weep for your forgiveness .
Though I said my name was Benedick , I heard this news with Claudio's ears .
Bad deeds will be revealed , no matter how people try to hide them .
I think they want him to go home and appoint Cassio governor in his place .
Isn't he an honest man ?
It's true .
Thus , it should be clear as day that King Pepin's title , Hugh Capet's claim , and the resolution of King Lewis's doubts all plainly derive from the female .
If you stick with me , when the time comes , there will be something in it for you .
I've felt neglected recently , but I decided that it was more likely that I was being hypersensitive than that they were intentionally unkind .
Anyone who has a house to cover his head has a good head on his shoulders .
Why is the Jew waiting ?
Enough .
Was there ever a match put together so quickly ?
Then we won't agree to his demands .
As a friend .
I'll use Albany's power and authority for now to win the war , but afterward one of the sisters , whichever one wants to , can get rid of him .
But what about your guilty conscience ?
The sky frowns and scowls on our army .
I'm seizing your lands and all that you possess until your brother gives testimony that absolves you of any guilt .
Yes .
There you go .
His speech was like a tangled chain .
I didn't kill Lysander .
And though I wouldn't dare to swear that you love me , still my blood begins to flatter me that you do , despite the ill effects of my face .
Keep my lover quiet .
And you're my husband , right ?
And I swear by my wickedness ( if I had any ) that I am a knave .
Oh , my old master ! , Who tied him up ?
Don't worry about how I handle it .
I'm going to tell Desdemona my feelings .
Caliban , who now serves me .
What an ass I am .
What , did you cheat on us before we deserved it ?
Here comes my wife now .
By his side lies the noble earl of Suffolk , York's comrade and equal in brave wounds .
Run , run , my lord .
Please just listen .
What's up , Grumio ?
Shylock is my name .
You're cold , cold , and you were never hot with lust .
I can't talk about my happiness anymore .
Oh , life is full of surprises !
She stood trembling , then suddenly dropped dead .
You know tomorrow is her wedding day .
I'm not sad , my lord .
I'm here , here !
Isn't it a pain that I can't choose or refuse anyone , Nerissa ?
Please , my lord , don't be friendly with her .
Oh no !
My gracious king .
And so , beautiful lady , I'm standing here just like that , wondering whether all this can be true until you tell me it is .
I wish the night were here already !
As for those who have , I beg you to excuse the gaps in time , and the many people and things that can not be represented here in all their magnitude and proper form .
Let me gather my wits and get serious here .
And he would have deserved it too .
This disrespectful stance toward the man who is your lord , your king , your governor tarnishes your beauty the way the frosts of winter blights the land .
We'll leave tonight and be home a day before our husbands get back .
We're friends !
What are you doing ?
And you , go call my fool .
Is that you , wife ?
In that case , I think Cassio's an honest man .
The person who suffers alone suffers the most .
Well , all right then .
Music , listen !
I'll have no halves .
Madam , madam , Antony's dead !
We have to think about that .
Please wait .
I'm very sick , too .
Otherwise , I'll die a virgin , devoted to you .
If our father continues to use his authority as usual , then his recent abdication of the kingdom will just hurt us .
The silk came from sacred silkworms , and it was dyed with fluid made from embalmed virgins ' hearts .
Fine , thank you .
I remember kissing her washing stick and the cow's udders that her pretty , chapped hands had milked .
Sir , you and I must part company , no , that's not it .
I bet my life on it .
And when is he leaving ?
Let's be angry only long enough to do the deed , and then let's act like we're disgusted by what we had to do .
He's waiting nearby to find out if you'll invite him in .
Are your men searching for him ?
Which plays , what music ?
I'm waiting here for the general , and I don't want him to see me with a woman .
You're a man with a good reputation .
Did you see Octavia ?
Some startling news has just arrived , sir .
But constant expression of wild grief will only make it tame , so I'm not going to say any more about my boys until I've gouged your eyes out with my bare hands .
Soldier , you are .
Good lord !
Let everyone beware : I can shake off the tyranny that now oppresses me whenever I choose .
Some kinds of lowly activities are done for noble reasons .
Put on your nightgown , in case someone comes and sees that we're awake .
Has Caesar gone to the Capital yet ?
What's that noise ?
If you are human , don't stand for it .
Bottom , you're Pyramus. , And Flute , you're Thisbe .
Coward !
What else you do know ?
Yes , but he'd deny it all .
Is Cassius nearby ?
Though I wish you were dead , I'm not going to be the one to kill you .
Stop !
Is it possible ?
I wouldn't commit so serious a crime for anything .
I'll do any decent thing , my lord , to help my cousin get a good husband .
One of us will stay and stand guard .
Yes , leave that labor to great Hercules , it's worse than the previous twelve put together .
Shame on you !
Armed , sir .
Swear you won't .
Run off , go visit fairs and festivals !
I leave him to you .
Well , first there was the prince from Naples .
Wasn't that the best thing to do ?
He has already been named king and has left for Scone to be crowned .
Just keep your love under control , and don't let yourself become a target of his lust .
A man with a wife like that might ask , "Hey , wandering wit , where are you off to ? " Nah , better save the questions for when you find her in your neighbor's bed .
Looking just like the dead king .
You've got it wrong , old man .
The nobles of Cyprus whom you invited to dinner are waiting for you .
All right , I understand .
I hope you think I'm faithful to you .
Is this true ?
Welcome .
He said he would deny that he wrote his letter ?
So good night to everyone .
Until then , my noble friend , think about this : I'd rather be a poor villager than call myself a citizen of Rome under the hard conditions that this time is likely to put us through .
I am no tyrant but a Christian king , whose emotions are as tightly controlled as the wretches who languish in our prisons .
This is the inventory of the money , silverware , dishes , and jewels that are still in my possession .
The humiliation that the king is suffering now will be revenged thoroughly .
What did he do to you ?
In any case , do what you want .
But did you tell him she cheated on him ?
I will see them .
But I'm as immovable as the northern star , whose stable and stationary quality has no equal in the sky .
On , on , on , on , on !
No .
I don't dare come down , forgive me , my lord , I don't dare , for fear of capture .
Your magic spell has such an effect on them that if you saw them now , you'd feel sorry for them .
It's good if you love Hero , because she's worthy of your love .
Remember that Hamlet is young and has a lot more freedom to fool around than you do .
What does a crocodile look like ?
Then Octavia's complaints will rouse Caesar , and as I said before , the thing that brought them together will part them .
Every month he has a new best friend .
Bring her out , brother .
Yes , you're speaking very well .
It seems that the guards who were supposed to be protecting his chamber did it .
Take comfort .
We'll go forward with you and meet them at Philippi .
I wish I had !
Now let Richmond and Elizabeth , the true heirs of each royal house , be joined together !
If things go well , bring the crowd to I'm off .
Even their clothes are unstained , and look fresher than before the storm .
The people have heard it already , and they've been told of his accusations .
Go back , slave , or I'll knock you one across the head .
You love me in spite of your heart , I think .
I'm that great gust to her fire .
It would be much appreciated .
Stanley , Richmond is your wife's son .
I suspect some foul play .
Her fallow fields are overgrown with weeds , while the blade that should uproot such wilderness lies rusting .
Your wife , sir , your wife .
And he deserves it , having been excellent before he had a reputation for it .
Take care .
Goodbye , then .
Here's my hand .
I'll take a look at your letter .
His mistake was hardly worth punishing him for in the first place , though in wartime it is sometimes necessary to make examples out of even the best soldiers .
Has anyone offended your Worship ?
I can see in your eyes there's been some good news .
Please , if you can do it without taking advantage of the young man , buy the cottage , pasture , and flock for us , and we'll pay you for it .
Should we go inside ?
And if she starts to drop off , I'll rant and yell until I wake her up .
Chop off his head .
Leave it alone , you fool .
Right in the middle of the fight , just when the battle could have gone either way , actually we had a slight advantage , that immoral Egyptian nag , May she die of leprosy ! , suddenly became frightened , and turned her ships around and fled .
Who was that ?
But fathers who are rich Make their children kind .
Adieu , good Mr. Depression .
So pardon him , dear father , for my sake .
My husband lost his life to get the crown , and my sons ' fortunes have been tossed up and down , leaving me to rejoice over their victories and weep over their losses .
Our army has recently acquired many of Mark Antony's former soldiers , enough to capture him .
I've got something for you .
Take your cues from my own despair .
I'm afraid we're intruding too boldly on your sleep time .
That's what we're trying to say , sir .
I've told you .
Is the throne empty ?
It's a capital offense for anyone from Mantua to come to Padua .
There , Leonato , take your daughter back .
We'll go visit Caliban , my slave who always talks to us so nastily .
With my music playing in the background , I'll lure fish .
You're tigers , not daughters .
I don't doubt your wisdom .
Get out of my sight , or I'll give you what you deserve and spoil Caesar's victory .
But I can't be too obvious about being on your side without risking the life of your stepbrother , young George .
A friend .
Go back again , slave , and bring him home .
Come on , you're drunk .
Yes , I'll go .
And bring the ship's captain to the castle .
The king and queen are coming down with everyone else .
I don't want to kill you before you've readied your soul .
Who's this ?
It's Captain Macmorris , right ?
followed you on your sad wanderings , ever since your bad luck began .
Oh , noble sir !
Their dying shouts broke my heart !
I'll give you frets ! " With that , she clobbers me with the lute so that my head goes right through ,
Why should that name be proclaimed more than yours ?
You weren't good enough for her .
You're going to ask me why I'd rather have a pound of decaying flesh than three thousand ducats .
I did .
Do they seem religious ?
I want to use this money to set my father free .
Well then , your uncle and the Prince and Claudio have been deceived .
I don't really want to do this , but he's given me good reasons .
Why ?
Come here , you wretch !
Tell me where you live .
They told me I was everything .
No , I don't , sir .
But why couldn't I say "Amen" ?
But with you it's different .
Oh , Antony !
I'll miss you , Ariel , but you'll be free. , Yes , you will , yes. , Go to the king's ship in your invisible state .
We'll put a leash on this danger that's now running wild .
Hey !
I'm telling you , it was Carthage .
My reputation , my reputation !
Remain calm until midnight , and then you'll see what the trouble is .
You lowlife son-of-a-bitch !
Please , just look over there .
I'll just stay here till the storm passes .
Tie him up harder. , You filthy traitor !
You don't have to tell us what Lord Hamlet said .
That was one hit .
We haven't yet encountered that danger , and the best thing to do is avoid it entirely .
Back when I was a schoolboy , if I lost an arrow I would try to find it by shooting another arrow in the same direction , watching the second arrow more carefully than I had the first .
As God is my witness , you know you're mine .
You should know , my loving lord , I've heard that the marquess Dorset has fled to Brittany , to the earl of Richmond .
What's going on here , you secret , evil , midnight hags ?
We will speak about this further .
I'd like to know .
It's true .
Or thorn-bushes .
Aren't you dead yet ?
I would have thought she was invincible against any assault of love .
I have to tell you , I thought you were a much kinder person than this .
I swear he's the better dog .
What are you doing ?
Be a careful mother , madam , and think about your son , the young prince .
Now he's a little crooked .
They want to talk .
Look how they kiss and carry on !
A crown was offered to him , and he pushed it away with the back of his hand , like this , and then the people started shouting .
Send him on his way quickly .
Well , well .
Your wife Octavia , with her self-effacing eyes and self-righteous assumptions , won't get any praise from patronizing me .
Tell me your idea first .
Where's my son Edmund ?
So , without further ado , the best thing to do now is probably just to shake hands and go our separate ways .
If you say one more word , I'll punish you , maybe even hate you .
Pompey , you can not frighten us with your navy .
It's after six o'clock , my lord , when you said our work would be finished .
Edward's healing touch is a miracle that I have seen him perform many times during my stay in England .
Is Marcus Luccicos in town ?
But don't I have good reason to cry ?
Oh , you excellent young man !
I don't know who had him arrested , but the man that arrested him was in a suit of leather .
Please go on .
Follow me .
You're appealing to a son who hates you .
What do you think ?
Don't worry , I'll be there .
If they have spoken the truth about Hero , I will tear her apart with my bare hands .
Now that the wind is favorable , let's board the ship .
The young snake that escaped will in time become poisonous and threatening , but for now he has no fangs .
But goodbye .
Come , Dolabella .
You're on very good terms with the duke of Exeter .
Watch out !
He plans to leave tomorrow .
They were planning to pull a mischievous trick on Ferdinand and Miranda , who have sworn not to sleep together till their wedding day .
Ugh !
After a brief time , as he is a strong , brave man ,
I'm not in the mood .
Everything is gloomy , dark , and dreadful .
No , if they try to lead us to harm , I will leave the dance floor at the next song .
I almost recognize that voice .
Either the lovers have different social standings ,
We'll eat at her place .
Lord Hastings , you and he are close .
Oh , chest , obey me !
Come , this way to the rowboat .
Oh , yes I am , father .
Driven ? " Really ?
But come , lords , will you come with me to Edward's room to comfort him ?
I've only done my duty .
Shame on you ; I've already run out of patience with you all .
Listen but don't speak to it .
Humble greetings , great master !
Lady Luck is a fickle whore And never gives the poor a break .
Go to the harbor immediately !
Calm down .
His knights are getting out of control , and he himself reprimands us about every little detail .
He is called Ensign Pistol .
Oh , damn three times , damn ten times the evil man whose wicked deed deprived you of your ingenious mind .
Death is the best way to cover over her shame .
Madam , keep up hope .
I pray that God ends his life before I die , so I can say , "The dog is dead ! "
By eight o'clock .
I was .
If he shows up tomorrow , I'll give him what's coming to him .
And in return for this gift , he wishes you to drop your claim to the dukedoms .
We need more help !
Oh , if you are the same Egeon , speak now , and speak to that same Emilia !
We'll talk about this later .
And good ones , too .
By St. Paul , ghosts have struck more terror in my soul tonight than ten thousand of worthless Richmond's soldiers could , dressed up in their most sword-proof armor .
There's good reason to escape when there's no mercy to be found anymore .
Next time I'll give you nothing for something .
You're a traitor. , Off with his head .
It's good you hunted for yourself , sir .
Stop !
What do you say to a piece of beef with mustard ?
But gilded tombs contain worms .
May you die of the worst disease !
Give me some wine and let me say a few words .
He's not getting anything except the penalty .
You make me so happy .
When did I say all that ?
Now my spells are all broken , And the only power I have is my own , Which is very weak .
Demetrius , I'm ready to fight you as promised .
One more time , we proclaim this publicly : If anyone will pay this man's bail , he will not be put to death .
I am being serious , my lord .
Pay him six thousand and cancel the debt .
Sinful Macduff , they were killed because of you !
If the world were mine , I'd give it all up , everything except Demetrius , to be you .
Greetings , good general !
Please stop , sir .
It's locked away in my memory , and you've got the key .
Knock , knock , knock !
Say that it's my fear that keeps you inside and not your own .
Goodbye to you all .
Naked in bed together , but without doing anything ?
If you do that , I'll never respect you again .
Are you sick ?
And , as the speaker of any prologue should , I ask you to hear our play courteously and to judge it kindly .
If I gave them all I own , I'd have two fool's caps for myself .
No , lovely princess .
Dear Macduff , I beg you , tell us you were lying and say it isn't so .
Draw the curtains , just like that .
My lord , what are you talking about ?
I hate to say it , but it's almost two and we won't get there before suppertime .
Good Volumnius , you know that we went to school together .
Divine , perfect woman , give me a chance to prove in detail that I'm innocent of the evils you accuse me of .
Take it to heart , Dorset .
And here comes father .
Which of you two ate lunch with me today ?
Ha , ha , ha !
What garment would your Honor like to wear today ?
I'll go to the right side .
Farewell , kind lord .
Yes , my lord .
Iago , who started it ?
That'll keep them from being afraid .
We'll burn his body in the holy place and use the brands to set the traitors ' houses on fire .
What time is it ?
You're taking a shorter route .
If he's in a good mood I'll mention you again , and do everything I can .
Did I do anything good to myself ?
I'm not sick if you've prepared some honorable exploit for me .
Do I ask you to follow me ?
They ought to be whipped for being so stupid .
Lorenzo will be happy with what we've done .
Thisbe is the lady Pyramus is in love with .
Cassio , how did you get my wife's handkerchief ?
Can you blame him ?
We come to hate that which controls us .
Oh , I've been murdered unfairly !
Would you walk out with me , sir ? , Oh , Desdemona , Yes , my lord ?
Macbeth has heard this news and he is so angry that he's preparing for war .
It may be so .
Whether I go ahead with them or not is completely up to you .
I wish they were , so that I could die right now , because , at this point , I live a living death .
Oh , who did this thing ?
Hello , good sir .
Shame on you , warped hag !
That's music to my ears .
My lord the ruler of Burgundy , I'll speak to you first .
Give me that letter , sir .
The new challenge scared them about as much as sparrows frighten eagles , or rabbits frighten a lion .
Sweet marjoram .
He died like someone who had practiced how to toss away his most cherished possession as if it were a worthless a piece of garbage .
Every person I meet greets me like an old friend , and every one of them knows my name .
Now I am no more than a woman , ruled by the same lowly passion as the maid who milks and does the humblest chores .
This is amazing .
Ha , ha , ha !
Is everyone here ?
What good luck !
Noble Brutus has mounted the platform .
Good lord !
Crude slaves with greasy aprons , rulers , and hammers shall lift us up so everyone can see .
Then I have to assume you don't want him to be king .
God help me !
No , don't be ashamed , Cleopatra .
How dare What , is the man crazy ?
And there's another storm brewing , I can hear it in the way the wind whistles .
Because Pyramus is a good-looking man , the most handsome man that you could find on a summer's day , a lovely gentlemanly man .
Really , I'm afraid you are .
I like this girl !
Give him the instructions for our amusing little contract , and I'll go get the money for you right away .
What do you want to tell me ?
Oh , my daughter !
Keep it from leaving , Marcellus .
I want my bond .
This is how God forces wicked men to turn their swords against themselves .
He's definitely drunk now .
Come now , keep your oath .
You are welcome here , sister .
It won't go on .
I order you , speak !
Shall I accompany your Grace ?
I assure you , sir , the tender love I feel in my heart is stronger than the sexual passions stirring down below .
And make sure the servants are less friendly to his knights .
But for whose sake did I do that sick deed ?
Quickly , tell me how .
For my part , I'm sorry this battle turned into a drinking match .
Your beautiful eyes , sweet lady , have infected mine with love .
That's why paintings of Cupid , the god of love , always show him as blind .
Dromio , bring this money to the Centaur Inn , where we're lodging , and wait there until I come .
You think he's special , since you've only ever seen him and Caliban .
Too bad about the son !
Come , husband , let's go to lunch .
If you want to see your deceiver , then look at me .
Am I to be dictated to , like a child ?
I say it's the moon that shines so bright .
So please , old friend , give us some good advice .
There's a fool sharing my bed now .
Why , she challenges me like a Muslim would challenge a Christian .
Hurry , hurry !
I'm always happy to hear about brave men .
Do you believe his "offers , " as you call them ?
The leftovers from the funeral dinner made a convenient wedding banquet .
Bassanio , the best thing you can do is to keep living and write an epitaph for my gravestone .
Yes , you're absolutely right about how worthy Brutus is and how much we need him .
Perhaps What , my love ?
You'll get a blow from me for that , I think .
Well , let's watch it .
What's wrong with you ?
My lord , please go inside here .
God help Claudio !
A strange fish .
Who would choose to grunt and sweat through an exhausting life , unless they were afraid of something dreadful after death , the undiscovered country from which no visitor returns , which we wonder about without getting any answers from and which makes us stick to the evils we know rather than rush off to seek the ones we don't ?
Portia , are you really gone ?
If I extinguish the candle , I can light it again if I regret it .
Cleopatra , our conquest won't include either the things you kept back or the ones you listed .
He's a good man .
Play some music while he chooses .
How can that be ?
We'll meet you at sea .
What do you say , my fair I do not know dat .
Let's go find him and cheer him up .
Please hire Cassio again .
This guy is exactly the kind of person your sister warned us about. , Come on , bring in the stocks , now !
Isn't this Stephano , my drunken butler ?
Help !
I'm divided between two friends who are determined to kill each other .
Yes .
Nell .
That's all .
Please lock the door and keep quiet .
What can I do for you , sir ?
What a backward world we live in !
What have you done ?
Who does he accuse ?
Oh , you idiot !
But let's shake hands , Menas .
Where did we leave off ?
What do you think he wants ?
Treason !
But sir , have you married my daughter without my consent ?
But let it rain ; I'll survive .
And time itself is ended .
Everything's fine , now , sweetheart .
No , sir .
The poor souls , how strangely they talk !
Do you have to harp on my inadequacy ?
But didn't you expect us to cut the cloth ?
Where are you , keeper ?
What do you say , your Highness , about my just request ?
By God , I will tell the king about these taunts .
I wish I could see this invisible drummer .
All right .
They're entirely welcome .
I know who you are .
And , being a man of your breeding , you're going to be married under some shrubs like a beggar ?
I might wake you up in a while to send you on an errand to my brother Cassius .
Listen to the noble Antony .
This repays me .
No , you don't need to worry about us , Lorenzo .
For assuredly , you are so near the abyss that you're bound to be swallowed up .
The gods have ordained it to be like this , sir .
I've served you since childhood , but I've never done you a better service than telling you to stop .
If you want to make me happy , don't wish yourself harm .
Well , then , what should we do for fun instead ?
Now , don't forget , you promised me something .
And here he is .
She was too attached to her filthy marriage ever to do a thing like that !
I have a lot to do before noon .
Come on , servant , come .
Has my master returned yet ?
Well , we almost fought and then realized that we had reached the seventh cause .
Everyone who does so is a traitor and should be hanged .
Yes , I did , my lord .
I've looked at many ladies with pleasure , and been
Welcome .
For Brutus's sake , I am indebted to you .
That's him .
In that case , the wise gods deny our prayers for our own good .
It's good for your fresh wound and your bloody noggin .
As absolute a traitor as any in the whole entire world , or even France or England !
He mixed that poison himself .
He's not a "master , " sir , he's just a poor man's son .
Wait , Petruchio , I should go with you .
The friar's ready .
She can turn and turn , and then turn on you again .
He is in heaven , where you will never go .
Keep up your courage , man !
Now , please , I beg you , don't work so hard .
Sir , you're old .
Be tough , " says the devil , "and run ! " But then my conscience , hanging around my heart , says very wisely to me , "My good friend Launcelot , you're a good boy , the son of an honest man , " really , that should be the son of an honest woman , since my father cheated on my mother .
Yes , my good lord .
It's true , Hero says so .
Soon we will toast around the table .
I hear someone knocking at the south entry .
Promising favors ?
Pay me three times the amount of the loan and let the Christian go .
Who measured the ground ?
Antony's eyes are fiery red from crying .
The night has been chaotic .
Cassius , don't take it badly .
When he regained consciousness again , he said that if he'd done or said anything wrong , he wanted them to know that it was all because of his sickness .
Bring me the handkerchief , My mind is full of doubt .
What's the treasure , uncle ?
Of all the strange things I've ever heard , it seems most strange to me that men fear death , given that death , which can't be avoided , will come whenever it wants .
Thank you , and God bless you for your hospitality .
But I will tell you that I seduced Margaret , the Lady Hero's waiting woman , tonight .
The sky's so dark it looks like it would rain down boiling hot tar if the sea weren't swelling up to the sky to put its fire out .
Oh !
What does the lead box say ?
No , from the moon , I'm telling you .
What role did you play ?
Go get me something I can use to break down the door .
Are you down in the dumps ?
This is a majestic and harmonious vision .
Oh-ho-ho , kid !
I am bound by oath , so please forgive me .
If Caesar chose , Antony would jump at the chance to be his friend .
Hello there , good sirs .
Go to my brother Cassius .
Shame on you !
What does this say ?
But I won't shed any of her blood or scar that beautiful skin , whiter than snow and smooth as the finest marble .
Undress the statues if they're decorated in honor of Caesar .
Let go of me !
So , listen , Hermia .
Her bottom .
We don't come here with the intention of making you happy .
What's with you , my lord ?
I long to be immortal .
Aren't I your Rosalind ?
If grief doesn't kill me , I'll find a quicker way to kill myself , even though I think grief will do the job just as well .
That was too much .
But what love could make my Lysander leave me ?
Did you hear a noise ?
It's no time for jokes : sober up .
But those political considerations might last such a long time that the general will forget my love and service , especially if I'm gone and someone else has my job .
Now this is where you come in .
Then run away .
Not at all !
Sad or happy ?
And keep yourself hidden , I command you .
But first , I'll dump this fellow in his grave , then return to my love weeping with grief .
And like mine , but I'm getting a little tired of it .
Dear master , I can't go any farther .
But if Antony is alive , healthy , friendly with Caesar , and not Caesar's prisoner , I'll shower you with gold and pearls .
Pass the order along .
Sir , I think I saw him last night .
But this is a sure thing : the snake's an odd snake .
Where did he go ?
Kings and noblemen served him .
You sound out of tune .
Yes , indeed , it was , and he pushed it away three times , each time more gently than the last ; and at each refusal my countrymen shouted .
I had you figured for a piece of furniture .
Now , I'll swear to the opposite , that the pancakes were rotten , and the mustard was fine , but even so , the knight wasn't lying .
Who can blame him for acting crazy , when inside he condemns himself for everything he's done ?
I don't know what to believe , father .
Oh , goodbye !
I don't completely distrust you .
John Duke of Norfolk , Walter Lord Ferrers , Sir Robert Brakenbury , and Sir William Brandon .
God bless you and make you obedient , loving , and kind .
Oh !
Can we go ?
A person can only pay with their life once , and she has paid in full .
Hands , speak for me !
It sets you up for a fall .
And you're not to utter a syllable of Tranio's name .
You've connived to steal my daughter's heart , making her stubborn and harsh instead of obedient ( like she should be ) . , And , my gracious duke , if she won't agree to marry Demetrius right now , I ask you to let me exercise the right that all fathers have in Athens .
Go tell the hunters to blow their horns and wake them up .
The Egyptian snake is born when the sun shines on the Nile mud , just like the crocodile .
I frown at him , but he still loves me .
If your Grace would kindly appoint some members of your council to sit with me once more and go over them more carefully , I will give my answer and acceptance right away .
If not , then I'm a liar .
You belong to her .
Caesar , I never believed in omens , but now they frighten me .
I swear to God you're accusing me wrongly !
Madam , some actors happened to cross our paths on the way here .
He only married out of political necessity .
That's well spoken .
It would be excellent if they could make a man halfway between Don John and Benedick .
Oh , you bloody prison , fatal and threatening to noble lords !
Hasn't he proven himself to be a great villain , slandering , scorning , and dishonoring my cousin ?
Hail , king !
What could I hope to get from you , who've got nothing but your charm to support you in life ?
Have the excavators stopped work ?
Tell us about the letters that you got from France .
Opportunity's knocking for you , and in my imagination I see a crown dropping onto your head .
Then tomorrow at dinner ?
How nice of you !
What good does heaven have in store that can do me any good now ?
I can't find it .
You are my guests .
Tell me , who had him arrested ?
Oh , has it come to this ?
Even for a Good morning , lieutenant .
This is the perfect place to rehearse .
Go ahead , use your authority .
Now I see that you can't call anything good except in right context .
But in the meantime , just assume that I'm paranoid , as I'm pretty sure I am , and keep thinking she's innocent , please .
Yes , my lord .
Why , how could she have been murdered ?
Who's blocking the way ?
Young Prince Edward is still alive , what do you think I'm going to say next ?
At my house .
Sorry , sir ?
You see , we're not alone in our unhappiness .
We can be happy that things have been resolved so agreeably .
I'll leave him alone .
Yes , at Philippi .
I'm asking you to understand my point of view .
Away !
Well done !
Which is either a fool or a nothing .
Come on , you keep getting paler .
Ah , ladies , ladies !
You're right , actually .
The Moor is being tricked by some crook , some terrible villain , some rotten bastard .
Call him !
All right , then .
Me too .
But I do think it's the husband's fault if we wives cheat on them .
Where are these murderers ?
No , it is not possible you should love the enemy of France , Kate .
I want to do a little good despite my evil nature .
What is there left to do ?
One of these three boxes contains her lovely picture .
God , help us not be jealous !
Look at you !
It's his handwriting , my lord , but I hope he didn't mean what he wrote .
By all means .
No , no more than is reasonable .
By my father's death , Your life has dishonored his death .
This is the end of my journey , the end of my life .
But my dear , when I said I was worth nothing , I was actually bragging , I should've said that I was worse than nothing .
Go ahead , swear to that , so you'll be damned to hell for lying .
But I promise you , Kate : the older I grow the better I'll look .
As long as I'm alive , I'll be here .
Please avoid doing that .
I will settle this matter .
If I were king ?
This paper tells me of ten thousand Frenchmen who lie dead on the battlefield .
Well , should we head to the Tower ?
Please , marry us .
It would be bad if she knew about Benedick's love and teased him about it .
If you were king , we would do the same .
You go down toward the Capitol , and I'll go this way .
If that's what you want , all right .
I've spent five years in the remotest parts of Greece and roaming all over Asia .
Right , and they wore proclamations around their necks , saying , "Be it known to all men by these The eldest of the three brothers wrestled with Charles , the duke's wrestler .
Oh God , do I have to remember that ?
Why won't he ?
Who's been with her ?
What happened , general ?
Forgive my boldness if I take you up on your words about making magic .
Is this your good friend who's in so much trouble ?
Go to hell , you whore !
Now , we go contentedly to freedom , not banishment .
Who are you talking about ?
Gone , sir .
So it's not my business that's making me sad .
Gentlemen , please try to sharpen his interest even more , and let this play do him some good .
Oh , I'm dead !
God has blessed you with a good name .
They sing when they die .
Get out of here !
Now I feel my soul leaving .
Well , it certainly wasn't true for Richard !
It doesn't make either of us happy , I know .
My brother is imprisoned because of you , I am disgraced , and the nobility are held in contempt while those who two days ago weren't worth a dime have suddenly been promoted .
And what oath do we need other than that we honest men have told each other that this will happen or we will die trying ?
And as long as she's herself , wise , beautiful , and faithful , she'll always have a place in my heart .
As it dissolves , so shall my life .
Yes , and paid me well for doing it .
They're very anxious for you to get there .
Will you , Strato ?
I'll recite a prophecy before I go .
I wish it were day !
I think if we had fought , we would have proven too young and strong for them after all .
The more I love him , the more he hates me .
I did .
What do you think of these quick-witted folks , Gremio ?
Good !
Come here .
If I were in England now , like I was once , and I had even a painted picture of this fish , every fool there would give me a piece of silver to look at it .
I thought your heart had been wounded by a lion's claws .
Therefore , you should obey their wishes .
My lord , I know what I'm saying .
Then every soldier must kill his prisoners .
What a farce !
Come and get it !
Motley is the only thing to wear .
They're all ready to eat dinner .
You always know he's got some plan that pleases him when he says good morning with such gusto .
Just the weathervane moving .
Your wife and children were savagely slaughtered .
Your son Edward , who stabbed my son Edward , is dead .
Some of those lines had more feet than the That's not a problem : the feet can bear Sure , but these feet were
And why's that ?
It's true , my lord .
It's yours .
Invite all my sad captains .
We'll hit him on the head with the handles of our swords , then throw him in the wine barrel in the next room .
Well , I won't .
Call out my household servants .
I have to admit that when I saw his suicide during rehearsal , I had tears in my eyes , but they were tears of laughter .
I'm going to make you look sharp , Laertes .
You won't enjoy it much , I can tell you , the odds are so against this young man .
You gentle Romans , Quiet there !
I wonder what it means .
How can this drama be so many contradictory things ?
I'd do anything to bring them back together , since I really care for Cassio .
And on their graves , I trust , the story of this day's work will be written in brass .
Jacob didn't have any control over what happened .
You don't know how quickly affection can be killed with a single nasty word .
Why , he told me so himself , and he said he didn't care who knew it .
That's my way , when I see a crab-apple .
She is not , madam .
Here an angel's lying in a golden bed. , Give me the key .
That's very likely .
And why do you blame me for loving you ?
Yes , from Normandy .
I heard that Apollodorus carried , What did he carry , please ?
Is it really possible that you could like her right after meeting her ?
She doesn't have anything going for her so far .
I didn't survive a shipwreck so I could be scared of your four legs now .
This clearing will be the stage , and this hawthorn bush will be our dressing room .
You're going to make me jealous , Launcelot , if you keep taking my wife into dark corners like this !
I guess it's only one man , no big deal .
I don't know .
This madman will murder me .
You'll be pricked all over , and it'll sting like bees .
Sir , I think I have the right to speak , and speak I certainly will .
No , in its tongue .
That day will never come .
Why are you whipping that whore ?
He has an uncle here in Messina who will be glad to hear this news .
I prefer to call it a "hanger." But anyway .
Young man , when you wake up , if she's nearby , beg her to cure your lovesickness .
I don't feel guilty about them at all .
What's the trouble ?
Favorably , except that there wasn't enough time for his Grace to hear , as I sensed he would have liked to , the details about how he is rightfully entitled to certain dukedoms in France , and to the throne of France in general , through clear lines of descent originating with his great-grandfather , Edward III .
I found them on a tree .
I'm more anxious watching you fight than you are in the fight itself .
You would make a nasty suitor .
My creditors are getting mean .
Defend yourself !
Pay attention .
Oh Cassius , I'm tired out by many sorrows .
Revenge .
Oh , cut my bodice-staps so that my pent-up heart can have some room to breathe , or I'll faint from this deadly news !
Tie up the servant , for he is mad as well .
I've promised to make everything right .
He's married .
Actually , an old religious uncle of mine taught me how to speak , and he was brought up in the city .
I'll kill him !
Having already thought about the fact that she would have to die sometime , I can endure her death now .
You lie , you disgusting tyrant .
You and I can not be held within the confines of a country's arbitrary customs , dear Kate .
I know you .
God , that song's even better than the other one .
Is that how the law sees it ?
When you fight against your country's enemies , you will be paid for your efforts with your country's wealth .
Ha ha , are you good ?
This pantomime was probably a summary of the play .
She would make a good wife for Benedick .
Picture the linen sails driven by the invisible and subtle wind as they pull the vast hulls through the wrinkled sea , breasting the high waves .
Three times today my horse stumbled and started when he looked in the direction of the Tower , as if he hated to carry me to this slaughterhouse .
Well , what's going on , mister ?
He's too overwhelmed with shame .
I'll do so .
You are their heir and sit on their throne , and the blood and courage that glorified them run in your veins .
You'll find us both at Crosby Place .
Good idea .
I'll give you such reasons for killing him that you'll feel obliged to snuff him out .
They swore that you were sick with love for me .
May Egypt drown in the Nile and all good creatures turn into poisonous snakes .
Very well .
The advancement of your children , noble lady .
Who's there !
I'll stand , and so will Trinculo .
You don't have to worry about any of these lords , my lady .
It's worse than murder to humiliate a king's messenger like this .
I'll be at your service .
I have the authority to dismiss this court , unless Bellario comes today .
Please , write down "Borachio." , And yours ?
If he won't stop when he's told to , then he isn't one of the Prince's subjects .
How can you top that ?
He says your daughter's not feeling well , my lord .
Don't ever tell anyone what you've seen tonight .
Come here , herald. , Let the trumpet sound ! , Read this out .
I'll challenge him .
I'm at your service until death .
Are you ill ?
Three miles from here you can see it coming , a moving forest .
I'm telling you , your husband .
Indeed , he's not right for this .
No , I won't take a husband until they make men out of something other than dirt .
In exchange , give up your claim to love Helena , since I love her and will love her until I die .
The general is talking to you !
Some of them give me money , some invite me places , some thank me for the kind things I've done for them , some try to sell me things .
And be a happy mother by doing so .
Can he even get angry ?
Give me a goblet. , Hamlet , this pearl's yours .
Add details of your own to back up what I'm saying .
Go back to my sister's .
Fear will keep you safe .
Then you're a better man than the king .
Music !
We'll figure out the best time and safest route to avoid being found out by my father's guards , whom he'll send out as soon as he discovers I've gone .
He's insane .
As long as they didn't do anything , it would only be a minor sin .
Good-bye , good Queen .
Goodbye , nymph .
But why should my reputation for honor last longer than my honor did ?
Nobody like that should be trusted .
almost read people's thoughts .
Don't go back until I've carried the corpse into the marketplace .
Good cousin , good Meg , good Ursula , come help me get dressed .
Did you go to bed so late , my friend , that you're having a hard time getting up now ?
The king wants to speak with Cornwall .
You will , my lord .
He'll be a good governor .
If we are slated to die , the fewer , the better for our country , and if we're slated to live , the fewer men , the greater the share of honor for each of us .
I recognize his trumpet .
That's true , sir .
He smiled and said , "The better for us." He's right , and that's how it is .
The demon who seduced you could stride the world over with the proud gait of a lion , could return to hell and tell the devil's legions , "I will never win another soul as easily as I won that Englishman's." How you have poisoned my faith in people !
Yes , absolutely , no question or ambiguity about it .
I only wish I could load him up with all the praise he deserves !
Caliban !
I wish they had stayed !
They only feel the shadow of joy .
Here it is , I think .
While the armed hand fights in foreign lands , the wise head defends itself at home .
Go on , wear your boots out !
Want ?
I will choose this one and try my chances .
Did he charge interest ?
So you'd better not stay with him , Antony .
She is worse than wicked .
I told you , sir , they were totally drunk , so puffed up with courage that they were getting angry at the air for blowing in their faces , and beating the ground for touching their feet , yet even when drunk , they kept their plan firmly in mind .
You're right , that's how it is .
He sleeps all day like a cat .
And no man with a reputation will tarnish that name with lies and bad behavior .
Who are you talking about , niece ?
But insincere men , like horses who are too lively at the start of a race , make a big show of their spirit .
Go in , or we're done for .
And all because I use my own money to make a profit .
Do it now .
Look after my goods and possessions .
I'll keep my oath and patiently suffer through my anger .
You're the beautiful one as far as Demetrius is concerned .
You go and take care of your business ( since everybody has some business to take care of , whatever it is worth ) , and I'll go and pray .
Look at them .
Now this joke has turned serious .
I won't trouble you yet with questions about your situation. , Some music , please , and , good friend , sing .
Not until we part as friends .
It is three o'clock , and , Romans , before night , we will try our luck in a second battle .
Yes , my good lord .
I'm speechless .
And they respond to you with their hearts as well .
I say that I love you more than he does .
Good-bye .
It doesn't matter .
Say something , man !
Indeed , we have many good days to look forward to !
The will !
them brothers , friends , and countrymen .
I'll fight until they hack the flesh off my bones .
That's uncivilized and unnatural !
She'll die for it. , Eros , ho !
And the Prince and Claudio , who accused her , are innocent as well , because they were deceived by Don John .
You've said it , friend , and farewell to you .
I'm Trinculo , don't be scared , your good friend Trinculo .
So we are in agreement .
The level meadow , where the freckled cowslip , burnet , and green clover once grew , has become useless : unmowed , it grows to seed , so that nothing springs up but weeds , rough thistles , barren plants , and burs .
This one ?
Well , then , help me .
I think it's better to call it off .
Why ?
Ladies , you're dropping bread from the heavens to starving people .
And I'll help you .
He's crying out for you and swears he'll burn your face and disfigure you if he can get ahold of you .
This is pure insanity .
Please come in .
Yes , yes , and let's sing in unison , like two gypsies riding on a single horse .
Good morning , noble sir .
Peter Quince , What is it , jolly Bottom ?
It's a monster !
Then if he loses , it'll be his swan song , music before the end .
What ?
That's true , and with good reason .
I did , kind lady .
But you know , sirrah , we customarily say that the dead are well .
Your husband , being saddled with a shrew , projects his own suffering onto my husband .
My falcon is now hungry and unfed and must not be given enough to eat until she comes to me , for if her hunger is satisfied , she'll pay no attention to the bait .
You're kidding !
You're famous for it .
Well , don't face off with me .
How am I evil to advise Cassio to do exactly what'll do him good ?
I'm happy about that .
Look , it's going away .
My master's decision .
Oh , what a relief !
It's as silent as a graveyard here .
Did you see that ?
All the worse that she stooped this low , then .
They said they were acting for you .
When I was putting on the Ceres show , I thought of reminding you about Caliban , but I was afraid of upsetting you .
Stay inside .
I forgot about the reward .
We will , my noble lord .
I need people as trustworthy as you .
Good morning , worthy Caesar .
Yes , ma'am .
Oh Lord , who's that crying ?
Well , explain , but do it fast so that your puny store of kindness isn't used up by talking about it .
She trembled and shook because he stamped and swore and carried on as though the vicar were trying to put something over on him .
Yes , my lord .
I never offended him at all .
On the condition that your sister's son , Publius , also must die , Mark Antony .
Miserable England , I foresee for you the most frightening time you have ever experienced. , Come , lead me to the block .
All right then , legitimate brother Edgar , I have to have your lands .
Now , by the world , It's full of your ugly wrongdoings .
Edmund , go find him .
Why are you going crazy over these trashy clothes ?
Many men seek their fortune at seventeen ; at eighty , it's a bit late .
I'm very glad about that .
Good night , good brother .
Their shadows are like a deadly canopy , under which our army lies , ready to die .
Yes , madam .
Halt !
Sir , the laws of Ephesus will be on my side , and you'll be embarrassed .
It was just removed from from the heart of , oh , she's dead !
Clarence has arrived , lying , cowardly I'm not surprised it scared you , my lord .
Don't try to tempt me !
No , ma'am .
Just tell me what you want me to do , and however hard it is , you'll see that I'm eager to do it .
Was someone as beautiful as you meant to be a whore ?
Oh , and young men never die ?
You should be whipping yourself , since you lust after her and yearn to do the same thing for which you're punishing her .
We have two hours to get ready .
We'll draw straws .
No , don't even mention him .
Well , if it wasn't her , I don't know .
Because I'm a Jew .
You will listen to me .
I'd heard about my brother's plan and have been subtly trying to change his mind , but he's determined .
Is the duke of Exeter safe ?
How are my old friends from this island doing ? , Honey , they'll love you here in Cyprus .
If there are any , speak , for it is he whom I've offended .
I believe you are , Regan .
Shall I stay in this dreary world , which is no better than a pigsty without you ?
Come on .
A woman who was beautiful but never proud , who could speak well but knew when to be quiet , who dressed well but was never overdressed , who had self-restraint even when she could get what she wanted , a woman who never took revenge , who overlooked it when people hurt her , who was too wise to do anything stupid , who could think without revealing her thoughts , and who could refrain from flirting with men in love with her , that kind of woman , if she ever existed , would , Would do what ?
But if I were Brutus and Brutus were me , then I'd stir you up , and install in each of Caesar's wounds the kind of voice that could convince even stones to rise up and mutiny .
Your eyes are like stars , and your voice is more musical than a lark's song is to a shepherd in the springtime .
I pray that the mighty gods defend you !
But are they all safe , Ariel ?
I'll reward treason with blows , I promise you .
Only my free will , nothing else .
And how , out of your great heap of knowledge , will you manage to prove that ?
I'll give him some liquor .
I will say as much to his face .
An illicit kiss !
I'd like to get to know you better , Mr. Cobweb .
The only reason you left India was to come here and see that butch Amazon Hippolyta .
You are all Lord of lords !
Yes , it's me .
Now I'll offend you whether I give it to you or not .
You are in a perilous state , shepherd .
I will harp on it till my heartstrings break .
Where ?
Thank God" , that's a good answer .
She's a perfect woman , it's true .
The woman who might have blocked you from all the murders you've committed by strangling you in her cursed womb .
Oh Dardanius !
You're brave gentlemen .
Wait for mine , sweet soul .
Absolutely , if you can find a wife by then .
They are my daylight , my life .
That's what you'll say once you've seen part two .
You coward , did you run away from me ?
But first I'll release the fairy queen from the spell .
I think it was at sea .
Is there anything inaccurate in that ?
This is like if I asked you to wear your gloves when it's cold outside , or eat nutritious food , or do something that's good for you .
How would you woo her ?
Not with any sauce they could provide for them .
I'll speak to him now .
Let him thank me , who helped him get there .
Well then , the beef without the mustard .
All I can hope for now is a share of the feast .
What do you mean , do I think so ?
I'll meet it if it's the last thing I do .
Nor is it up to you , my lord .
Oh , come on. , Come here , sir .
Francis Flute , the bellows-repairman ?
It's a subject as worthy of endless discussion as the changing sea .
Take me to the man my husband is in debt to .
Take him away .
Yes , I do , lady .
Come with me .
It's best to rehearse there , because if we do it here in the city , we'll be bothered by crowds of people and everyone will know the plot of our play .
You gave an excellent performance .
I will , madam .
You'll work for me .
Pronounce them , it is just as nice to say .
I'll prove that I'm an honest man and a man of honor if you dare defend yourself .
Oh yes , I heard them all , and more , too .
It's true that your son Lucentio here loves my daughter , and she loves him , or else they're putting on quite an act .
It wants us to speak to it .
This is beyond weird .
Definitely a tailor , sir .
Where am I ?
He I can't tell what's going on .
God will free you from blame .
To Dover .
More than anything else in the world , I love you , value you , and honor you .
That's me .
To hell with all worn-out horses , all crazy masters , and all bad roads .
If you do , please give it to me , because I need to start learning the lines .
And did they ask you to tell Beatrice about this , madam ?
Othello's career is over .
Why ?
Ah , dear , if that is true , let heaven make poisonous hail grow from my heart , and let the first hailstone drop down my throat .
They want to whip me for telling the truth , you want to whip me for lying , and sometimes I'm even whipped for keeping quiet .
No , I had to do something .
It's been proven that Lady Hero is innocent , that the Prince and Claudio have been utterly deceived , and that Don John , who has run away , is the source of all the trouble .
No braver than this ?
That's him , madam .
His name is Balthazar .
That's no way to pray .
I'll go to Ireland .
Caesar loses supporters wherever he raises money .
Then your other senses must be getting worse because of the trauma of blindness .
I'm afraid of what they might encourage him to do , considering the state he's in .
I need better evidence than the ghost to work with .
I swear , I'm telling you what I honestly think .
Duke of Burgundy , if you want peace , the lack of which creates these misfortunes you describe , you must purchase it buy agreeing across-the-board to all our very just demands .
She will not .
The whole world thought your father was an honorable man , but he was always my enemy .
What about you ?
I was an idiot to take it !
lain .
It used to be that when you knocked a man's brains out he would just die , and that would be it .
Well , old man , I'll tell you news of your son .
Richard loves Richard , that is , there's just me and myself here .
Well , the difference of a horse !
And if you treat us badly , won't we try to get revenge ?
I'm so sorry .
Well there , now you've said it .
I have news , old news such as you never heard before !
I don't think it's a good idea .
Lord , how painful it was to drown .
Let them in .
Have you returned smiling from the great battle for the world ?
She could even what ?
True .
What ?
Go on , my loving lord .
Very good , sir .
You won't kill me , will you ?
Once , on a cold and windy day , when the river Tiber was crashing against its banks , Caesar said to me , "Cassius , I dare you to jump into this rough water with me and swim to that point there." As soon as he spoke , though I was fully dressed , I plunged in and called for him to follow .
Oh God , who is , by the way , the best comic of them all .
Otherwise I would have been perfect , as solid as a piece of marble , as firm as a rock , as free as the air itself .
Like hell !
Does it mean being truthful ?
Do you want to destroy our old friendship by joining these men to insult your poor friend ?
Do I have the asp's poison on my lips ?
The town is besieged , and the trumpet calls us to the gap , and we talk and do nothing , by Christ .
I told you not to hang around my house .
We You won't pay for the glasses you smashed ?
He intends to do something bad to you .
Come to think of it , I am feeling sleepy .
Where are you now ?
Goneril , you know how much I love you , but still I have to say , Shush , please .
The old priest at Saint Luke's Church is at your command at all hours .
My father , I think I see my father .
And don't we have passions , and a taste for fun , and weaknesses , just like men ?
You do the same , wherever the crowds are thick .
He'll never follow anything that other men have started .
The next man who swings his sword must not care about his life , because the instant he strikes , he dies .
Oh , I don't know .
No , you'll see , four days will quickly turn into four nights .
She cheated on me , and she was a whore .
And return to us immediately , bringing Messala with you .
Please find a way to give me some time alone with Desdemona , if you think that's all right .
Go , go , good countrymen , and to make up for having done wrong , gather up all the poor men like yourselves , lead them to the Tiber , and weep into the river until it overflows its banks .
If our criminal master gets off free , I won't care what happens to me anymore .
No , my lord , that was me .
He'll have to kill both of us , and indeed we're both men .
If I didn't have a good reason to do this , damn me to the very bottom of hell .
My lord ?
Yes , I am .
I swear , I love you .
If there's any way I can spoil his life , I'll be overjoyed .
If it turns out that she really is running around on me , I'll send her away , even though it'll break my heart .
It's easier to rule a third of the world than a wife like that .
Go ahead , then .
Tell him I'm sick .
That's a good one .
Ah , you sorceress !
Then hurry up and tell me what you want .
Believe me , I'd rather have lost a purse full of gold coins .
Be kind to her .
That was the limit for me .
Where is my gracious lord of Canterbury ?
Well , I've begun my reign with a carefully thought-out plan , and I have every hope of succeeding .
Right over to that I hope he enjoys her .
There's very little about her that's gloomy , my lord .
For more important things , you'll say no .
Get going already .
Goodbye , my sweet lord. , Goodbye , my sister .
I know it's the sun that shines so bright .
Maybe , but I wish I'd never laid eyes on him .
Bandage my wounds !
The king is coming .
No one should have an honor he doesn't deserve .
I don't have any news to report , my lord .
Not true .
This is a stranger business than men have ever set foot in before , and it's not natural either .
Go home to bed , Francisco .
Hello there , sir !
Not at all , not at all .
Please stay seated .
Yes , I truly think He did great good .
My spirit friend , Harpier , is yelling , "It's time , it's time ! " Dance around the cauldron and throw in the poisoned entrails .
They're ready , my lord .
And now you're asking for money .
Are you making fun of me ?
How could he have even entertained these thoughts in his heart ?
Carry your master out .
No , please don't hate him , for my sake .
The only thing you can sense are punches , just like an ass .
The meat was fine if you wanted to eat it .
I've spent most of my money , and tonight I got beaten up .
But jealous people don't think like that .
Hover about her and tell her she got what she deserved , with her children dead before their time .
He thinks "G" is me .
Aren't you Kent ?
This castle is in a pleasant place .
Give me Bianca for my inheritance .
It's the devil speaking through him .
And what is this useless ceremony of kings ?
Has your heart cooled toward me ?
Just looking at you makes me sick .
Oh God , he's murdered his master !
My heart feels like it's about to explode .
You'll be ashamed of this forever !
I make the laws , not you .
Didn't you know ?
What kind of question is that !
This poor guy's partly confessed his plan .
Do you think they're married ?
I ask too much of you , but you're always willing .
They say you are a melancholy fellow .
Who are these people ?
Why does the world report that Kate is lame ?
A worthy fool !
I'm sure I can guess .
Our masquerade mates are waiting for us .
I'll talk with this good man .
You mournful princes and grieving gentlemen who have been sharing this burden of grief , now it's time to cheer each other up with love .
I understand now .
When you see a huge wheel rolling down a hill , you shouldn't try to hold on to it or it'll break your neck .
Orlando , do you really believe that this boy can do everything he's promised ?
And she is very smart .
I was born as free as Caesar .
I admit it doesn't look that way to me , and the fact that you suspect me shows that you're smart .
But yet , madam , I don't like the sound of "but yet." It reverses all the good that came before it .
I could live a thousand years and I wouldn't be as ready to die as I am now .
Anyway , he is what he is .
His absence means he's broken his promise , sir .
Is that true , my lords of England ?
Oh Lorenzo , if you keep your promise to me , I'll end this agony by becoming a Christian and marrying you .
Yes , sir .
Damn it !
How is it that you've come back so soon ?
What can I do for my lord ?
I'll be there early .
Remember what I've told you .
Their lips , like four red roses on a stalk , touched .
As it is God's will and pleasure , Captain , I entreat you to come quickly to the king .
Let me see , what do you think about falling in love ?
When you record these sad events in your letters , please describe me exactly as I am .
He's not himself because he feels so ashamed .
Everyone who comes to gamble on winning me has to swear to these three rules .
Ariel , go order my goblin servants to make these fellows ' bones ache , give them muscle cramps all over , and give them more bruises than leopards have spots .
Whatever you want , I made it for you .
Who'd waste his time talking to such a stupid bird ?
But here are other matters to be dealt with .
Look who's coming .
I was not myself , as a result of the wine .
Mantua .
Guys who'd take her with all her faults , provided there were enough money involved .
Her once-trimmed hedges , like prisoners with wild , untended hair , put forth unruly twigs .
Fast !
Has any man seen him at the barber's ?
Yes , it is .
It's leaping about like a frisky horse .
I believe your Honor is thinking of a character called Soto .
God have mercy on us !
Fulvia is dead .
You know I'm powerful enough to make you pay for this .
It's too bad that Antony's fault should make you look like a jerk .
I know how Too light for a lout like you to catch , though no lighter than I should be .
That's true , my lord : I did get this ring from her .
My uncle ?
Many men have sold their souls Just to view my shiny surface .
Against my brother Lucius ?
If either of you knows any secret reason why you two should not be joined in marriage , I order you on your souls to say so .
The weather is fair .
But even if I thought you were right , it doesn't matter .
Don't disturb his soul .
And you deadly cannons that roar like thunderbolts thrown by the gods , goodbye !
There goes a strong fellow , Menas .
What's your name ?
I think it would be very hard to arrange for them to have sex while you watched .
The man hasn't done anything wrong .
What's your name , friend ?
You are only a soldier .
Come on , men !
Thank the lord for alliances !
He doesn't know what he's saying .
If you like , we'll stand by and wait to do whatever you need .
This will make our actions seem practical and not vengeful .
As sure as I'm standing here , I saw him .
We're all against what Caesar stands for , and there's no blood in that .
It doesn't matter where , so long as it's not here .
Well , you're a liar , then .
I hope you're not trying to cheat me .
If you don't mind , I'd like to speak with you .
Are my master and his wife coming , Grumio ?
I only partly believe it , for I'm enthusiastic and resolved to meet all dangers without wavering .
We'll be there , and there we'll rehearse courageously and wonderfully , truly obscenely .
Please tell him I have surrendered to his fortune .
When she cries , all the little flowers cry too .
We'll listen to him .
I heard the news , my lord .
If you're going to lend us this money , don't lend it to us as if we were your friends .
How could I forget , my lord !
That awful , plodding rhyme sounded like a row of dairy women stomping off to market .
Good luck .
He certainly flattered them both with extravagant compliments .
Tomorrow , my lord .
Well then , here's more money for you .
It's all right , since they left their food behind , and we're hungry .
If he's nearby , I want an explanation .
Happy indeed , the way we have spent the day .
No , come to my cabin .
Good morning to my sovereign king and queen .
You attract me to you , you cruel magnet !
Is there any news about my husband ?
Here .
Who wishes that ?
How do you know he loves her ?
She will be the bond that joins our kingdoms and our hearts .
I'll meet all your attacks , even if you come charging at me with a lance at full gallop .
I hear my father coming .
To escape the decree condemning me
Who doesn't know he's dead ?
And so will I .
May the evil one take me if I meant it like that !
If you want to read it , as I haven't heard it yet , though I've heard too much of Phoebe's cruelty .
Why have you come here in such a mob ?
The poor thing , he is so shaken with a fever that it's terrible to see .
Then you are damned .
Peaseblossom .
Some water will fix that .
Where am I going ?
Why , no , sir .
Just as tall as my heart .
By Jupiter , if I were Antony , I wouldn't shave my beard today .
No ?
Tomorrow , Caesar , I'll be able to tell you what land and sea forces I can raise for this war .
Did Diana ever beautify a grove as much as Kate beautifies this room with her queenly movements ?
This is a classic example of the idiocy of the world : when we're down and out , often because of our own excesses , we put all the blame on the sun , the moon , and the stars , as if they forced us to be bad , or the heavens compelled us to be villainous or stupid .
Give a quick example .
Farewell , good Salisbury ; and may good luck go with you .
I owe you nothing until I receive the necklace .
Damn it , show me what you're going to do for her .
Come on , sweet Audrey .
Good madam , be patient .
Swearing is for priests , cowards , overly cautious men , feeble old people , and those long-suffering weaklings who welcome abuse .
This disease is beyond my medical skills .
That pale face of yours will frighten the others as well .
Hooray !
Is that the law ?
But she's modest and ladylike too .
As you wish , sir .
Thank you .
I definitely will .
Good night , madam .
What do you want from me ?
But now I see our weapons are like straws , our strength like a straw's weakness , and our weakness past comparison , so that we seem to be the thing we most are not .
What's the news ?
Just listen this once .
That's it !
I'm the man who was born to tame you and change you from a wildcat Kate into a Kate as gentle and domestic as other household Kates .
He had no patience .
My lord , my life is as important to me as yours is to you , and it was never as precious to me as it is now .
Your peace of mind depends on him .
Now , by St. George , my knighthood , and my crown , The first you profaned , the second you dishonored , and the third you stole .
No , I'll recite it for you right now : "de hand , de fangres , de nails , " "De nails , " madame .
The only possibility is that you've murdered him .
Swallows have built nests in Cleopatra's sails .
We had a little food and fresh water that a nobleman from Naples , Gonzalo , had given us out of the kindness of his heart .
Why are you locking her away because of this fiend from hell , Signor Baptista ?
Who comes with him ?
There they go , Silver !
Was that the Caius Cassius that I knew ?
Good .
My sister would be much more offended to have her trusted messenger abused and assaulted just for carrying out her orders. , Put his legs in the stocks .
Let me see , let me see .
They have a coin in England stamped with the figure of an angel , but that's just engraved on the surface .
How do you feel ?
So don't advise me .
What can you do but be happy ?
You'll wear a mask , and you can make your voice as high as you want to .
It is not destiny's fault , but our own faults , that we're slaves .
My husband ?
What I deserve is that you treat me like a queen , and what you deserve is to act like my subjects .
children have lost , or no longer have time to learn , skills that should be a credit to our country .
Hello , sir .
Amen to that .
I must go to his house and tell his wife that he came bursting into my place like a lunatic and stole my ring .
Did he beg my pardon ?
I'll tell my husband what you've said , Launcelot .
Yes , Caesar ?
If you sit down , I'll carry your logs a while .
I just did my duty , sir .
That's what the Prince and my fiance say .
I'll do that .
We'll all want our fortune told .
Do you have unusual snakes there ?
Why "let it strike" ?
Tell me , are you and Ensign Pistol friends again yet ?
Has Fortune turned on me , like the whore she is ?
Oh , look , sir , look , sir !
Orlando ?
Bring them right in .
I hope heaven protects him from the weather , because I lost sight of him on the stormy sea .
But I'll stop rebuking you .
Is he enough of a man to wear a hat and grow a beard ?
Give me your hand , Leonato .
My lord , they're waiting for you to give your daughter away to Claudio .
Why didn't I just adopt a beggar's child left at my doorstep , whose shame and dishonor I could have denied , not being its true father ?
The duke of York sends your Majesty his respects .
I wish there was less social pressure to drink .
The wind's whipping up the waves so high you expect them to reach the clouds and splash against the stars in the sky .
My lord , I have thought over the request you just made of me .
Let their beds be as soft as yours , and let them eat the same food as you" ?
No Corin , since you're old , you can not guess , even if you were as dedicated a lover in your youth as there ever was , sighing and mooning all night long .
I swear to God I'll get revenge .
What shall I do ?
When I left him , he was less than nine miles from here .
Hang him immediately .
It's easy to get Desdemona on your side .
And yet for all that , if she didn't hate him to death , she'd love him to death .
Sir , what is your opinion of me ?
Please do .
How long will a man lie in his grave before he starts to rot ?
As they pass by , grab Casca by the sleeve , and he'll tell you if anything important happened today , in his usual sour way .
If we meet him at Philippi , these people will be at our backs .
What if your husband strays elsewhere ?
If it does pass , the Church will lose more than half of what it possesses , because the bill would strip us of enough real estate left to the church by wealthy , pious men in their wills to support fifteen earls and fifteen hundred knights , six thousand two hundred squires , and a hundred well-supplied almshouses for the relief of lepers , old-age pensioners , the poor , and those too weak or sick to work .
Does everyone kill what they don't love ?
The servants Macbeth killed .
Even the traits that become me most kill me when you don't approve of them .
The man who tells a lie and swears by it is now considered as brave as Hercules .
Let's see .
Then I guess beggars are the ones with bodies , while ambitious kings and heroes are just the shadows of beggars .
Our imminent separation so occupies our thoughts that even though you stay here , you come with me , and even though I leave here , I stay with you .
Good luck , sir .
Damn those men shouting down there !
My lord , I have news for you .
The duke will be here tonight ?
I had a son , whom I've legally disowned .
Are you blushing ?
Hastings and Edward's children , Rivers and Grey , holy King Henry and your fine son Edward , Vaughan , and all who have died from underhanded , corrupt , fiendish injustice , if your angry souls are witnessing this moment through the clouds , enjoy the revenge , laugh at my ruin !
It's clear that someone less noble , less loyal , more bloody-minded than Clarence but not a blood relation , deserves as bad an end as my brother , but he goes free .
Do you know what Caesar intends to do with me ?
His wife probably did it on purpose because she knows what kind of fits he's having .
All the spirits hate him as much as I do .
Therefore , I beg your Highness , pardon me .
But men tend to interpret things however suits them and totally miss the actual meaning of the things themselves .
Those men you just mentioned will be beheaded today .
Die where you have lived , in my arms .
He looked to the side , and pay attention to what he saw then : under an oak tree , whose lower branches were mossy with age and top branches ancient and brittle , he saw a wretched beggar , with overgrown hair and beard , asleep on his back .
What should I say ?
It blushes , is easily embarrassed , and stages regular uprisings in a man's heart .
I'm sorry about your daughter's death , but I swear our accusations were true , and backed up with proof .
Good-bye .
It is .
You're most welcome .
That's enough for the senate .
Do it .
Then she ran away to grieve alone .
Prince Dauphin , you'll stay with me in Rouen .
Sir , such a life with such a wife is unlikely !
Now , my dearest Queen , Please , stand farther away from me .
We would not want to die in the company of a man who fears to die with us .
It doesn't matter if it's in tune so long as it's loud enough .
You are to bring his daughter to the supper .
Let me deal with this .
I got it from you , I never said I didn't .
The sweet fool in a fool's costume , that's me .
And we will raise your wages .
The gods know , Oh , never has a queen been so betrayed as I have been .
Here , sir , as foolish as ever .
I can help you find a wife who's rich , young , beautiful , and reared in a manner fit for a gentlewoman .
Since you're letting me leave , I'll hurry .
Let it end , or let me die so I won't have to watch any more of it .
You seasoned his food with screams .
Three-time traitor and whore !
As good a reason as any .
But let's stop this drinking and get down to business. , God forgive our sins ! , Gentlemen , let's get down to business .
At least two hours past .
How can you stand there shamelessly talking about me and Hippolyta , when you know that I know about your love for Theseus ?
Good Hermia , please don't act so bitter toward me .
So let's see it .
He does hear me , and that makes me cry .
I wish you could face your bad news like a man !
I'll go now to find out the date of the wedding .
But there's more work to be done .
Treason !
The smell of leek turns my stomach .
I learned to do this from you .
Tell him that the mayor , some citizens , and I have come to confer with his grace in matters of great importance concerning the general good .
May God keep you well , sir .
What , my dear lord ?
It's a deal .
Go back to where you're staying and go to sleep .
I'm sorry I said anything .
I'm not feeling well , that's all .
Why , friends , you don't even know what you're doing yet .
Goodbye .
I'm glad your father isn't alive to see this .
It said , "Love me and don't leave me." How can you talk about the quality of the poem or the value of the ring ?
I really believe your cousin was falsely accused .
I'll take it over to the pile .
Will it eat me ?
There , take that , you scoundrel !
Caesar hanged him for this service .
If you hadn't been their father , your white hair would have inspired in them only compassion .
I'll have Herod's head chopped off !
Time has come round , and I'll end where I began .
Put a lot of cash together .
Around nine o'clock , madam .
Sweet saint , for goodness's sake , don't be so angry .
What worries have kept you awake tonight ?
Yes , very well , sir .
Call him .
Please take them off .
Nobody's coming ?
I've had news that my Nell died of the pox in a hospice .
Good night , good boy .
I'll wait over here .
My king , they haven't come back yet .
How ?
So go to your deaths , poor miserable wretches , the pain of which may merciful God give you the strength to endure .
EPHESUS Now what do you think ?
A fox you've trapped And such a daughter Should both be slaughtered , If my fool's cap is worth a rope to bind them .
What are they doing on the road ?
I hope you're an expert in your field .
Be on guard duty tonight .
Here comes one of them now .
The king my father ? !
Unless you can also teach me how to forget my banished father , you shouldn't try to teach me how to be happy .
In what sense , my lord ?
And so , my words and thoughts will be at odds .
You were tricked into fighting , Gloucester .
Yes , right away .
Take this garment , put it on , and then come back here .
That's not how I do business .
I was never disloyal , and I never will be .
Let's call for help and get them tied up again !
What performances have been prepared ?
Punish me if it's not true .
Maybe they call me that because I am cheerful .
Well sir , good night .
They shouted three times .
The container of that great soul is now cold .
Claudio !
I'm sure it is to knight you , Captain .
Oh , heaven help me !
That counts for everything .
If I default , he'll pay you .
Oh , monstrous !
Soldiers , watch carefully .
Yes , I will .
What , the necklace ?
Me , ma'am ?
Good .
She's well .
It would be easier to do it in the dark .
I can not live without her .
What does that mean , sir ?
Go , lad , and find out what the trumpet's sounding for .
You should ask me what time of day it is , instead .
Tell me , Captain Macmorris , have you left the tunnels ?
It's a lot to ask of a maiden .
Let's do it with no show of anxiety , no , with no more fear than if we'd heard that the English were busying themselves with folk dancing .
You would have made me treat them like a tyrant. , I'm done , my lord .
Set it down awhile .
Since it's drizzling , stand under this overhang with me and , like a true drunk , I'll tell you everything .
Oh !
Love cools off , friendships break up , and brothers become enemies .
Come with me and I'll get it for you .
We will , my lord .
In fact , I consider ambition to be so light and airy that it's only the shadow of a shadow .
Too quickly , we boarded a ship .
And who is England's king but an heir of the great York ?
Well , let me get back to my choice .
Well , I recognize this one Good God !
Catesby .
I believe you , and I ask you to forgive me .
Things have certainly changed !
That he was never trained as a soldier .
Yes , very bad .
I'm surprised my bland husband didn't meet me on the way here .
It's getting there .
Good night , dear Captain Blunt .
I put those wedding sheets on your bed , as you asked .
You see how naive and foolish I've been .
Lord Alexas , sweet Alexas , most anything Alexas , almost the most consummate Alexas , where's the fortuneteller you recommended so highly to the Queen ?
That's true .
Be patient , I'm telling you .
What part of the agreement did I break ?
On top of her ?
Here's the head of that notorious traitor , the dangerous and unsuspected Hastings .
It's strange that Regan and her husband left their house without sending back my messenger .
When will there be another like him ?
He is .
Dear sister , it's unfair to me , and unfair to yourself , to turn me into a slave .
Yes , certainly .
Sir , I must get that diamond ring back from you .
Not by the likes of you !
Is it a weakness ?
I saw that .
And I'm such a sensitive ass that if my hair even tickles me a little , I need to scratch .
Tell them to slick down their hair , brush their blue coats , and make sure their socks match .
It's coming toward me .
I think this night is just like sick daylight .
I remember , Adam , that's Here comes my master , your brother .
If not , to tell you I will die is true , but not for love , by God .
But , tell me , where is the noble Richmond now ?
Thank you .
Yes , even if I had whole kingdoms to give along with her .
I heard Octavius say that Brutus and Cassius have ridden like madmen through the gates of Rome .
I must tell you then .
Where is my lovely bride ?
That's too long. , Servants , leave her and me alone .
I will lower my voice .
There's a nicer piece of work right here .
Come on , take control of your feelings .
Then right next to him I saw the murderers , dripping with blood , their daggers rudely covered in gore .
Oh , a plague has been prevented , thank God !
Here comes another group looking for you .
Let me speak proudly : tell the Constable we're only workaday soldiers .
The more I pray , the less I get out of it .
And if your love can produce something from its sadness , write a poem for her ; hang it on her grave and sing it to her bones .
I swear I thought you meant you'd been hurt physically .
If it's possible to do this without putting yourself in danger , dear Captain Blunt , say goodnight to him from me and give him this important note .
Damn you all !
Are you any kind of philosopher yourself , shepherd ?
Your wife and brother led troops against me , claiming to be fighting in your name .
Don't trust Trebonius .
Feed him apricots and blackberries , with purple grapes , green figs , and mulberries .
Let's go offer up our lives
What can I say ?
Okay .
The king made peace among all of us .
What soldiers , milk-face ?
They killed my children too ?
Oh , I'm dying , Horatio !
I'll tell you as soon as I know , Richard , because at this point I have no idea .
My father's studying hard , so he won't see you .
The king will be angry with him .
You're not going to take him .
For love to appear in his true likeness , he would have to be as Cupid is : naked and blind .
Hail to your majesty .
Sir , I can't .
Who's that ?
If he agrees , great .
Enough !
I won't refuse you anything .
I thought the clouds were talking to me , the winds were singing to me , and the thunder , like an awful organ pipe , roared Prospero's name .
Either there are wars in heaven , or else the world , too insolent toward the gods , provokes them to send destruction .
Oh , it's too terrible .
He refuses to admit what everyone else knows .
It would please him very much if you would rely on his wealth and success to support you .
Wherever we go , men will smile at us while hiding daggers .
Then do so , with all your heart .
Where are those bastards ?
Be careful not to fall in .
No , he refused it publicly , in open court .
But tell me , are you speaking seriously ?
Who did it ?
I work for Titania , the Fairy Queen , and organize fairy dances for her in the grass .
I mean when I wore it at your daughter's wedding .
Last night , when that star to the west of the North Star had traveled across the night sky to that point where it's shining now , at one o'clock , Marcellus and I , Quiet , shut up !
Where are you , Pindarus ?
Turn around , you dog from hell , turn around !
Cambio is transformed into Lucentio .
Neither will I .
You'd better get me But does he know that I'm here in the forest and dressed in men's clothing ?
Take this mad wretch to jail. , Father-in-law Baptista , will you see that he's available to appear in court ?
No , indeed , my lord .
What , does the news only get worse ? , Please , Bassanio , I'm half of you , so let me bear half the burden this letter brings you .
It's a strange snake .
I'll finish my lecture after dinner .
My mistress , " I said .
Well , all of these should be in the lantern , because they're all in the moon .
Fine , but you weren't harsh enough .
She can't possibly have done you any wrong .
He'll tell them so .
Oh , for Pete's sake !
If we can do that , everything will be all right .
We're done for !
Me , "greedy" !
He meant he did nothing right for me , which is true , unfortunately .
I'm not sure I can wait that long .
How do you mean , "conspired" ?
All right , but first let the ambassadors speak .
Come , gentlemen , let's go in .
Hold off burying her until I've caught her in my arms once more .
I'm coming .
What would you like me to do at Salisbury ?
Goodbye !
And I hope you realized I wasn't very happy about it .
Good-bye for a while .
Thus , I'll leave without being kissed .
I haven't seen him for two days .
You were worn with honor .
My lord , the enemy has already passed the marsh .
But since , To get back to the matter at hand , what do you think of our proposal ?
We're on a tight schedule .
The devil's after me !
He wants the child for himself , to accompany him on his wanderings through the wild forests .
Try again .
A faithful shepherd worships you .
Someone deliver the order that Buckingham be brought to Salisbury .
I come to ask you out of charity to let us wander over this bloody field to record the numbers of our dead and bury them , separating our nobles from the common men , for many of our princes , alas ! , lie drowned and soaked in the blood of mercenary soldiers .
Don't do this !
I will , sir .
Bad times ?
Haven't I resisted even Brutus , begging from his knees ?
What's important is the urgency of this mission .
Do so .
He drinks like this every night before he goes to sleep .
What friend ?
No , he's not .
I see Regan and Goneril in hell , A thousand hissing devils with sizzling red pitchforks come up to them !
Where is Duncan's body ?
Will my daughter be a good musician , do you think ?
And if he ever has a wife , let her be more miserable when he dies than I am now .
Well gentlemen , we've heard our assignment .
If arguing makes us sweat , the real trial will turn that water to blood .
She is our principal demand , one of the first points of the treaty .
Dear woman , you don't know the rules of charity .
I'm really worried about that .
If you struggle to bring down a tyrant , you will sleep peacefully when the tyrant is killed .
Yes , as safe as her brothers ' lives were .
Your majesty !
And when I'm king , remember to ask me for the earldom of Hereford and all the possessions that go with it , which my brother the king used to own .
Don't let them know fear .
Help me , ladies !
Who's there ?
And why do you blame me for loving you ?
I should have waited to tell you my news .
I'll help out , if only because he speaks the same language as me .
Here , hang them on this clothesline .
Many people faint when they see blood .
But , my lord , this boy was born in the forest and has been schooled not in the usual subjects but only in magic .
Drunk ?
Call up the Master Constable Dogberry .
If you can prove that I'll ever be so in love that I can't be brought to my senses with a good round of beers , you can pluck out my eyes with a love-poet's pen and hang me on a brothel's door where the picture of blind Cupid usually goes .
We say the king is wise and good , and his noble queen is getting old , pretty , and not jealous .
Go and tell my daughter I want to speak with her .
Can't Lord Stanley sleep ?
There are lots of ways to get on the general's good side again .
It's this servantlike mentality that's keeping you unmarried .
Unnatural acts will cause Good night , good doctor .
I hope he's grown a lot since I last saw him .
The things men do daily , not knowing what they're doing !
It wouldn't hurt you to be charitable .
Sir , he ate with this woman at the Porcupine .
Tell me .
Maybe you will find a husband without a beard .
Oh no , not if you say it right .
My old brain is troubled .
Don't wrong her birth .
Please , give my regards to your mother , Mrs. Peapod , and your father , Mr. Peapod .
How did her eyes get so bright ?
Oh , what a long , tedious , exhausting night !
Your threats are no stronger than her whining. , Helena , I love you .
The day , my friends , and everything await me .
Well , if you don't , then I'm out of here .
Everyone thought it would pass then , and it probably would have had it not been for the great civil unrest and uncertainty of the time , which required the matter to be put off .
And leave you out ?
Come out .
I pity England , but not myself .
Regan , is that what you said ?
A fine ship , with some good people in it , I'm sure , smashed to pieces .
Won't the ladies be scared of the lion ?
My soul is full of sorrow .
One thing is certain : he's out of control .
Am I in France ?
Caesar's speed defies belief .
And there's no need for wonder or worry .
Oh , he's crazy , Laertes !
Yes , just as great and just as recent .
I guess now she's going to be my sister-in-law and not my wife .
I find you quite gentle .
And since I wooed her in your name , I'll join you in disgracing her .
That's me , sir .
What's the matter ?
Your lives are over .
I'm awkward in my speech and I'm not a smooth talker .
Murder , murder !
The storm has begun and everything is at stake .
Sure I can , father .
I will allow you one day to look for help in Ephesus .
Oh , well .
It will rain tonight .
Nothing that I know for sure , but a lot that I'm afraid might happen .
Take up the sword again , or take me up .
I'll be right next to you .
Now I've paid you back , Parthia , and gotten revenge for Marcus Crassus' death .
Last night she got no sleep , and she won't get any tonight .
Yes .
Be silent and go in .
Captain Macmorris , I beg your pardon , but would you grant me a discussion or two with you , see , partly touching on or concerning the practice of war , the Roman wars , for the sake of argument , see , and friendly conversation ?
Then you should offer the gods a sacrifice to show your thanks .
Goodbye .
What right did he have to scold me like that ?
How many noblemen would be weeded out and would become peasants ?
But I don't hate Orlando .
He's an important person .
To tell the truth , Gratiano , you're giving your wife a valid reason to get upset .
Revenge !
Oh , my dear mistress , I won't be able to finish this work until sunset at the earliest .
Follow his chariot , like the greatest disgrace to your whole gender .
Just one glass .
I'm off to Venice .
Weren't you the one who made him desert Perigouna in the middle of the night , right after he'd raped her ?
And she screamed at me , right ?
Hello and God bless you , sir .
Kent can speak rudely when Lear goes mad .
Beat ,
Am I on earth , in heaven , or in hell ?
We'll send Mark Antony to the senate house , and he'll say that you're sick today .
You are welcome for his sake .
Sex and marriage are honorable things , even for a beggar , right ?
God willing , our love and our happiness will only increase as we get older .
You're rubbing salt in his wounds when you should be applying bandages .
Follow your spirit , and as you charge cry , "God for Harry , England , and Saint George ! "
But I'm sorry I've blurted all this out .
I will go lose myself , wandering up and down throughout the city .
Naked , " he says .
Why should I stay , In this vile world ?
No , the man who can not extol the virtues of my horse from dawn to dusk is not particularly clever .
It really is good to see you .
If she punishes you , master , she's sure to punish me .
Tell me what I want to know .
Richard has set boundaries between my love and theirs ?
If the Jew cuts deep enough , I'll pay it instantly with all my heart .
Do as I told you .
I thought I had escaped from the Tower and was on a ship to France with my brother Richard , who persuaded me to leave my cabin and walk on deck with him .
Call in the messengers sent from the Dauphin .
Nah , I don't care what their
If Hamlet makes the first or second hit , or gets back at Laertes by making the third hit , then let my soldiers give him a military salute .
Hello !
No , nothing .
Please , pay him immediately .
You're older than me .
My lord , he will swear on his life that I haven't kept a thing. , Tell the truth , Seleucus .
Do you know anyone who would kill someone for money ?
No , not a penny .
He's coming , ma'am .
And then ?
Go to bed , and sleep .
Yes , that's it .
And welcome , welcome !
My God , I'm the highest-ranking person who speaks this language , if only we were back where it's spoken .
If your wife's not a madwoman , and you tell her how much I deserve this ring , she won't stay angry at you forever if you give it to me .
Pretty lady , I'm much ashamed of your shocking behavior .
Don Pedro is here .
Do you hear what I say , lady ?
By the way , I don't want anyone thinking I'm drunk .
And here comes the warden , just in time .
It's wrong , and I'm starting to realize I'm being cheated !
That's the one .
This poor virgin isn't much to look at , sir , but she's mine .
Are you going riding this afternoon ?
Like hell she is !
Yes , madam , twenty different messengers .
Here , I'll tell you my whole plan in my carriage , which is waiting for us at the gate .
Now the time is right for us to speak , and we do so with imperial authority .
Listen , hussy , is this man one of your customers ?
We're probably a very valuable catch for these guys .
It's hard to make sense of such different stories .
If your Majesty would like , I'll muster up my friends and meet you wherever and whenever you like .
I know the sound of his walk. , Die , villain !
What's the name of this forest behind us ?
The pound of flesh that I want from him was very expensive .
You killed my child .
Kind Tyrrel , will your news make me happy ?
Let's carry him to the barracks .
Like the Oh stop it , you lusty bed-hopper .
I have come to announce that Juno has asked you , Ceres , goddess of the fields and the earth , to leave your rich farms of wheat , rye , barley , oats , and peas , the hills where the
There is a particular lord who will watch you perform tonight .
Where have you been hiding ?
Jailer , watch out for this one .
From my house , if I had a house , " "The sixth of July .
Let the gods who stirred up this dreadful storm bring their enemies to light .
Men can be masters of their fate .
Who deserted this morning ?
Bring them to me .
Your brother Don John the Bastard has run away from Messina .
Say it again , just one word , and my hand , which killed your lover out of love , will kill your far truer lover .
In any case , Antonio assured the duke they weren't with Bassanio on his ship .
It's time to put our armor on .
Please go , sir .
It was armed , you say ?
I hope you'll recognize me when we meet again .
Don't worry about me .
No one will listen to it .
Do my simple features please you ?
You , will you join with me ?
I don't see any blood .
Indeed , my lord .
I don't hear anything , madam .
Only too well .
I think you're my mirror , not my brother .
What did you say ?
The queen wants you to chat with Laertes , politely , before you begin your match .
It's like a monster that just grows and grows , out of nothing .
Aren't they at this very moment on the western shore helping the rebels land safely from their ships ?
Since my beauty no longer pleases my husband , I'll weep away what's left and then die with weeping .
That's her father and his friends , who've been roused out of bed .
The king is coming here tonight .
Have you seen my lord ?
But you don't have any of the symptoms my uncle told me about .
Get up .
God forbid !
Go to the church : take the priest , the clerk , and some reasonably honest witnesses .
Tell me which part I'm going to play , then go on .
I'd kiss you before I spoke .
Good morning , my noble lord .
Indeed , before you arrived here , old Siward , with ten thousand soldiers already prepared for battle , was making his way here .
For shame !
But for the whole world ?
Ruining his meals , his enjoyment , and his sleep would drive any man or beast mad .
My poor husband , my dear Edward !
For eighty-one weeks he will waste away in agony .
Thank God I'm not a woman and afflicted with all the giddiness that troubles that entire sex .
Speak , I command you .
Who are the new commissioners ?
Please , your Grace , tell me what crime I have committed .
She was previously Caius Marcellus' wife .
Take off my armor .
And Trinculo's drunk .
What a horrible day !
I will see you tomorrow , then .
Richard , a fiendish spy for hell itself , still lives , but only long enough to buy souls to send below .
Now go find the forest ranger .
Me too .
Hello , sir .
She says you're going to marry her .
I know exactly how to proceed .
Learn to see better , Lear , and let me stay here where you can look to me for good advice .
No , he did not .
You look like you have something more to say .
I was talking to a petitioner here just now , someone who's suffering from your anger .
Is the single man lucky , then ?
He's a good man. , Let's go , Desdemona .
The moon looks sad to me .
I'll do everything I can for you , Cassio .
No matter what you say , my father is not dead .
If there's any doubt , there is no doubt .
I admire your efforts , and all of you will share the rewards .
Go , Mardian , and let me know how he reacts to my death .
Let's go .
Let me just ask her one question , and by your authority as her father , order her to answer truthfully .
Why , his cuckold's horns , of course , the kind you men are always blaming on your wives .
I've been invited to supper , Jessica .
Doesn't he deserve it ?
Come on .
I'm telling you , just watch his face .
Are you thinking about me ?
Birnam Wood .
Well , I wish you liked me .
Please , dear , come here .
The clock struck three .
Was a man ever beaten as much as me ?
You drunken slave , I sent you for a rope , and I told you what to do with it .
Just know this before I begin : I can't play a single note that's worthy of note .
This is the prophecy that the wizard
I'm afraid it will I'd love it .
Bless you , fair lady !
The door is open , sir .
Well , then he must be alive .
Claudio , I'm telling you right to your face that you have wronged me and my innocent child .
My husband will never get a moment's rest , I'll keep him up at night talking about you until he runs out
I admit I'm only a woman , but I'm still a woman from a noble family , I'm Cato's daughter .
Or tell me , my sweet love , what you'd like to eat .
Are you a suitor to the girl we speak of , yes or no ?
Will you take me , my lady ?
That's why he hates me .
He ate at my house , but that doesn't make me nervous .
I'll tell you what , Prince : a whole university full of wisecrackers couldn't change my mood today .
Were you dreaming , Lucius ?
If you still love her after that , then marry her tomorrow .
Oh , what an excellent young man !
I urge you to deliver your verdict .
He loves Caesar best , but he also loves Antony .
I'll go tell the king about this .
I know a terrific wench .
Me neither , my lord .
In Spain , Caesar had a fever , and it made him shake .
How long do you plan to stay here in this forest ?
He and his daughter are captured .
With a touch of green in it .
Good old lord Gonzalo , " as you call him , is saddest of all , with tears running down his beard .
Were you born here in the forest ?
What evil and deceitful mirror made me think I could rival Hermia's starry eyes ?
Yes , like your horse , who , staggering under your boasts , would trot more easily if some of them dismounted .
Who was it that came here ?
Do you know why the King of France suddenly went back home ?
Before you got so angry , I never would have thought that .
You've described a warm friend who's cooling off .
You should know this : much luck is on my side , and my enemies have happened to wreck their ship on this island .
honor you .
Bring out the stocks !
We'll have one heart , one bed , two bodies , and one faithful vow .
This sunken-eyed hag was brought here pregnant and left by the sailors .
Taurus !
I was his daughter when your Highness took my father's dukedom .
Is there anyone to give the bride away ?
Where's Metellus Cimber ?
I won't stay behind .
How did you two get separated ?
I don't think it would be wise to let Mark Antony , whom Caesar is so fond of , outlive Caesar .
Wouldn't it be better , since I'm unusually tall for a woman , to dress myself like a man ?
The battle on the sea is almost lost .
Is this the same Moor whom the senate considers so capable ?
Yes , and be wise .
I am not here to disprove what Brutus has said , but to say what I think there's a lot of sense in what he says .
You must be over there .
Then the writer imitated the one I composed to my steed , for my horse is my mistress .
Here's to Caesar .
Farewell , brother .
Though this island may appear desolate ,
Look , here I have Macbeth's cursed head .
Sir , do you know who I am ?
Besides , they're fresh .
I know that she is worthy of that love .
She had put a wreath of fresh , fragrant flowers around his hairy forehead , and the drops of dew that lay in the center of the flowers made the flowers look like they were crying with shame to be decorating the head of that ugly jackass .
What was your dream ?
Give me an almanac .
Have I hugged you yet ?
I'll follow in the center of the troop formation , which I'll defend with my best horse , and with Saint George on my side , as well !
So all hail , Macbeth and Banquo !
Come here , you .
There isn't a nobler man than Antony in all of Rome .
I feel bad for scaring you like this , but it would be much worse for me to let you come to harm .
Quick , let's hide , my lord .
But it's dangerous to make him try to make sense of the time he lost .
You think she gave it to Cassio ?
No one's heard from him .
In this recent storm .
Marcus Octavius , Marcus Justeius , Publicola , and Caelius will go by sea , but we'll keep the bulk on land .
Too late is more like it .
I wonder if you'd be so good , you lousy , rotten villain , to grant my wish and my request and gratify me , see , by eating this leek .
Only children are afraid of scary pictures .
There isn't a single drop of sincerity in him that could be touched with love .
We want Antony taken alive .
In this house lives a man who despises all that is good in you .
And I've built two chapels where solemn priests sing continually for Richard's soul .
And earth !
Oh , listen to me , night , Who is this ?
I just speak directly .
The next person to strike again dies .
I can't sleep quietly in the Tower .
This may have seemed like the pinnacle of sadness , but if I went on I could outdo it .
Well put , Maecenas .
Good news , friends .
Don't leave me in the lurch .
I'll listen to Brutus .
This terrible storm has smashed the Turks so badly that their plans are ruined .
But don't be afraid to take the crown that belongs to you .
What are you accused of ?
Double , double toil and trouble , Fire burn and cauldron bubble .
So be it .
Trust me , you could slide all the way from my shoulder to my heel taking no more of a running start than the distance between my head and my neck .
Do you maintain the same story ?
Your wit is too courtly for me .
I'd trust him with everything I own .
My memory is hazy , more like a dream than a recollection .
As king , I can not risk the danger he represents as he grows crazier by the hour .
Oh , finish what I've begun .
And still do , I swear by my hands .
Please sir , if love or money can buy anything in this empty place , tell us where we can rest and feed ourselves .
The problem is in what the letter says , as far as I can tell .
Yes , I swear .
You feel love because you feel lust and you have no willpower .
Oh , evil , evil !
Bring him my head .
Yes , Caesar , but it's not gone yet .
Awake , my lords !
God give you joy , Petruchio .
You need to leave to take care of your own business .
Why ?
Then , in my tent , you can elaborate on your complaints , and I'll listen .
I'll take no lesser name than that of Something that refers to my current state .
If I saw twenty of the greatest powers that pay tribute to Caesar taking such liberties with her hand , what's her name now ?
Are you talking , you villain ?
Come on then .
Uncle , I'm coming out !
I didn't .
You kick me out , he kicks me back .
This is to feel the news , not hear it .
Gentlemen , calm down .
Welcome back !
She will purchase that peace with an everlasting war .
Now go ahead and tell me the rest of your story. , Please go stand farther away .
Hello , do you have any news ?
My master and my lord !
These are nothing but jealous lies .
Dighton and Forrest , whom I hired to perform the butchery , are used to killing people , the bloody dogs .
And weren't you the one who made him cheat on all of his other girlfriends , like Aegles , Ariadne , and Antiopa ?
Agree to swear .
What is it , Octavia ?
I saw Bassanio sail away , and Gratiano went with him .
Kingdoms and provinces dropped from his pockets like loose change .
Ask her to help you get back your position .
Is she dead ?
But don't let me keep you from going , Cassius .
If he's never drunk it before , it'll help soothe his fever .
It looks better in a king than his own crown looks on him .
Damn it !
Oh , most bloody sight !
They'll consider you and Jessica masters of this house in place of Lord Bassanio and myself .
I don't know , except they are busy with some phony guarantee .
I confess my crime and throw myself on your Highness's mercy .
Her reputation was as pure as the snow , but now it's as dirty and black as my own face .
Maybe he won't see me .
Very well , ma'am .
Signior Tranio , you also took aim at that bird , though you didn't hit her. , So here's a health to all who've shot and missed .
But you still wish the gods had made me poetical ?
Take it , brave York .
What , isn't my mother coming ?
What captain do you serve ?
We won't , sir .
What , even you , Brutus ?
I won't bother with it .
I hope you haven't lost your mind .
Where that "sweetheart" said I was her husband !
I'm here .
It's even stranger when an angel is so angry .
We'll leave you here .
The highest-ranking ?
If you say it isn't true , I'll give you a province and make you rich .
A man , sir .
But never mind .
It's your job in life to kill the innocent ?
If we flee from the boar before the boar even pursues us , we'll only make the boar angry and suspicious , causing him to chase us when he never intended to .
The ambassadors are back from Norway , sir .
Whatever else happens tonight , I hope the king escapes safely !
Wake up , wake up !
Alas , grim death , how vile and ugly your near-twin , sleep , is !
My lord .
Here he comes .
You just missed a fight that was barely avoided .
Why , our troops amount to three times that .
He wasn't sad , because he knows that his disposition affects others .
Oh , Kent , what could I ever do to become as good as you are ?
Our reasons are so well considered that even if you , Antony , were Caesar's son , you would be satisfied with them .
Who should hang them ?
The poison is as sweet as balm , as soft as air , as gentle , Oh , Antony ! , No , I'll take you too .
Oh , but I think of him more highly than I say I do , and I wish he looked worse in other women's eyes .
So how short am I , you painted barber pole ?
You promised to tell me .
Take three times your money .
Fight it like a man .
Don't be crass. , You all look confused .
Tell him to surrender .
He answered , "You penniless bastard !
Is Othello angry ?
Thus far has our straining author pursued the story with his crude , inadequate writing , keeping important people penned up in this little room while he mangled history's full glory with his uneven telling .
A boy robbed you , but you'll beat up the post instead .
So you'll go to hell ?
Talk to the ambassadors who've just come back : ask them how majestically he responded to their message , how well supplied he was with good advisors , how restrained in expressing his displeasure , and , moreover , how terrifyingly firm he was in his resolve .
Yes , that's it !
Let's get dressed quickly and then meet in the hall .
I'm afraid the people have made Caesar their king .
If you aren't weeping , it's a good sign that I'll soon have a new father .
My lady , will you have a dance with me ?
Yes , even power gets in its own way .
So order the armies to rest , and let's go home to share the glories of this happy day .
The brave experience death only once .
This fake astonishment of yours is just like your other pranks .
The lady's overdoing it , I think .
How about it , Corporal Nym ?
The only reason they don't get punished and cured is that the disease is so commonplace that the nuthouse nurses are usually suffering from it , too .
Here .
Come with me , my dear Cordelia .
The king sent us to give you his thanks and to bring you to him .
Maybe you should ask , what will you do for a husband ?
Mighty duke , look here and see a man who's been treated most terribly !
Me too .
Not that I know of .
Tell them you know that Hero loves me .
What heir of the York family is there alive other than myself ?
I never knew a woman who loved a man so much .
And what would you give me for the handkerchief ?
No more foolish talk .
Instead of Celia , call me Aliena .
Their sweet smells come from those little freckles .
And here I am , with that piece .
What's that ?
For I'm sure that although you may know what temperance is , you've never experienced it firsthand .
This is a love token from some other slut , and you want me to copy its pattern for you ?
Don't you
Cassio !
The reason is that it's what I want .
I have to stay with the servants , who are with our camp's luggage .
I , who have heard the rumble of guns in battle , and thunder in the sky ( heaven's version of artillery ) .
Let's hear what he has to say .
I tell you I requested that your master cut out the gown , but I didn't ask him to cut it all to pieces .
Will your Majesty grant us permission to freely express the message we've been asked to convey ?
We might as well call him a man , since God created him .
Swear your love for each other .
A murderer should look like you do , so pale and grim .
Why , you silly man !
The best thing about me is that I'm hardworking .
Good evening , good evening .
Look , here comes just the man we were looking for .
Believe me on my honor and keep my honor in mind , so you may believe me .
I want my bond , so stop talking .
They won't pinch me , frighten me , push me in the mud , or mislead me unless he tells them to .
We'll see about that !
I am the son of Marcus Cato !
Who do you mean ?
Though we have lost a generous king , we are about to enjoy the benefits of a new king .
Be violent , bold , and firm .
I know my nails are stronger than my eyes ; I'll scratch them out .
The heavens only announce the deaths of princes .
I wonder if the lion's going to talk .
What symptoms , my lord ?
What was that thing I saw moving away from you up on the cliff before you fell ?
Yes sir , thank God .
But so what ?
That's how things should be , straight and smooth .
My own flesh and blood rebels against me !
Has he come home yet ?
The tragic actors from the city , the ones you used to enjoy so much .
Kill Claudio .
Oh , where have you led me , Egypt ?
Luck and Antony separate here and now .
No , not for all the world .
Ah , soldier !
Why shouldn't she take my hand , father ?
How will you wreck this marriage ?
Caesar wouldn't take the crown .
I don't like sports .
It's your music , madam , from your house .
Claudio deserves to be honored , and Don Pedro has rewarded him accordingly .
Have them come in .
That's right , you stupid thing .
Good night .
Why would you be so foolish as to beat the moody duke's favorite champion ?
We used to sit together and sew one flower with our two needles , sewing it on one piece of cloth , sitting on the same cushion , singing one song in the same key , as if our hands , our sides , our voices and our minds were stuck together .
He'd stay up all night and all day if he didn't drink himself to sleep .
Regan gives good advice .
Indeed , before he fell down , when he realized the commoners were glad he refused the crown , he pulled open his robe and offered them his throat to cut .
He is like a god and knows the truth .
But let him come .
Hey , Mountain , hey !
And you've come at a good time , so you can convey my greetings to the senators and tell them I won't come today .
I'd rather be a baboon than kill myself out of love for some woman I can't have .
Let me wipe it off first .
Very soon , because you want it .
How's it going , Shylock ?
Don't you trust my sword and these wounds ?
An honest tale succeeds best when it is told simply .
I don't want to be cured , boy .
Yes , your Highness .
Tell him my fury will abate , and I'll take the crowns .
Show him and make him grieve .
That only proves how inexperienced you are .
As soon as you kill Prospero .
Do you acknowledge the contract ?
Tranio got you that time .
God help me , I love you !
Sure , to a cheap host and an even cheaper guest .
I'm begging you , take the cork out of your mouth so I can drink the news .
Look !
As a favor to Nope .
I'll lock up the doors , grab some more ducats , and be with you right away .
What do the priests say ?
Getting right to the point , I live near the Capitol .
You're under arrest , sir .
And if he advances unopposed , my lord , let us abandon France .
And so , good morning to all of you .
Where is Polonius ?
You're in trouble either way .
From down here , I thought his eyes looked like full moons .
He followed you .
If you work for him , you're a fool and should wear a fool's cap. , So how's it going , uncle ?
Listen , my lords , We're in a bit of a hurry , Leonato .
There's no need to be , really , for , You're my teacher , so I must believe you .
But I won't sleep till I get back .
Let me unbutton this .
Show .
Between whom ?
Whisper to her that Ursula and I are walking in the orchard and that we're talking all about her .
But my eyes , which I've darted at you , haven't even left a mark .
Hey , if I'd remembered something about him , I could have had a good comeback for my uncle , touching on his growth worse than he touched on mine .
Yes , they are .
Yes , what time is it ?
And he's not going to do any tomorrow .
When she landed at the port , Antony sent an invitation for her to come to supper .
But I don't worry about being deceived because I don't need to trust .
And that's everything , Leonato. , Claudio , Benedick , my dear friend Leonato has invited you all to stay here at Messina .
My mind is confused .
I believe it won't stop moving and stand upright till Richard wears the wreath of the realm .
How old are you ?
I also hope that we can be better strangers .
Yes , just now , my lord .
There's no reason to be afraid .
What did that gentile fool say to you , hmmm ?
Very well .
Let me tell you , my friend , I'm almost insane myself .
Hear me , you wrangling pirates .
It doesn't matter .
Since I can't amuse myself by being a lover , I've decided to become a villain .
I'm here , I've been destroyed by villains !
Where are you going ?
My lord , I'd want to have the gift you promised me on your honor : the earldom of Hereford and all the possessions that go with it .
I , Wall , have done my part .
The king performs more wonders than seem humanly possible , challenging every enemy he sees .
One of you run to the Queen with the news .
Even if marrying her meant I died .
That's because you are near me , and you're as dazzling as the sun .
Young boy , I wish I could make you believe that I'm in love .
Don't be afraid .
We have to be married properly .
Your life has had honor in it .
Mark Antony , Pardon me , Caius Cassius .
Who talks of my nation ?
But if
It's terrifying .
Yes , he'll weep stones , as he taught us to do .
That he felt for me the love that I begged him to feel for you .
Next he slung his arm around the bride's neck and kissed her with such a smack that when they parted the sound of their lips made the whole church echo .
Don't talk to me , Emilia .
He's as smart as they come , but just a jester .
Speak .
It's easy for a liar to pretend to feel sorrow when he actually feels none .
Get up and tell me how you came here .
Yes , even if I had a thousand more pounds than that , for I hear that you are Me , too .
Here .
But
If he doesn't show up , the play is ruined .
Yes , sir , he's here at the door right now and asks to see you .
Have Montjoy hurry , then , Lord Constable , and have him ask the king of England what he is willing to pay us to get out of the war .
Tear him to pieces .
I would , my boy .
Let's play billiards .
Ingratitude is always hideous , but an ungrateful child is uglier than a sea monster !
It's a big deal to you .
Pompey is making the most of our absence .
I answered that Lepidus had become too brutal and abused his position .
Well , I hope not .
I had business that made me late .
Come on , be a man .
No , I won't .
I'll write how , under his flag and with his well-paid troops , we have beaten the formerly unvanquished Parthia .
Where have you been , my bravery ?
Hurry up .
May good luck follow you !
You truly did .
A man's virtues will always show themselves , and that's the end of that .
Here , my good lord .
Just as if they were perfectly loyal and faithful .
Give me the death sentence and end all my troubles .
Give me access to them , and soon you won't have to worry about them anymore .
If he were dead , you'd be weeping for him .
They let God see things they wouldn't show their husbands .
I'm going on alone .
Evidence enough to deceive the Prince , anger Claudio , ruin Hero , and kill Leonato .
Tell me , what does he think of our situation ?
Who's that ?
I'm sure some Christian will resort to trickery to get you .
Bad people can't appreciate wisdom or goodness .
The death of my father , my physical weakness , the loss of all my friends , the threats of this man who's taken me prisoner , all that would be easy for me to take , if only I could look through my prison windows once a day and see this girl .
I have nothing to say to you .
You're a bitter fool .
Let's play .
Speak to us .
Yes , the leader of the team ; the one that gets you if you can't pay a debt ; the one who assumes people are always going to bed and says to them , "Have arrest." Well , sir , stop your joking there .
Thirty-five or thirty-six of his knights met him at the gate , and together with some others they've set off for Dover , where they claim to have powerful friends .
Where are my slippers ?
I was told that by one who knows him better than you .
Come .
Why did Cassius conspire against Caesar ?
End it , then , and everything is over. , Eros ! , I'm coming , my Queen ! , Eros ! , Wait for me .
Did you find my daughter ?
My lord , I informed them as much .
My worthy Cawdor !
How did we manage to get ashore ?
Oh , yes , Benedick has returned and is as cheerful as ever .
Please be quiet .
Your eyes look like they've sunk into your head .
Why are you asking me that ?
You've already done something you should be sorry for .
Didn't you hear their shouts ?
He's too argumentative for me .
Oh , spite of spites !
Oh , kill me !
A leathermaker will last nine years .
But you can't see where you're going , sir .
You will be the king .
Ah , how pitiful !
That's cowardly and womanish .
Oh , it's horrible , horrible .
Can you smell out his secret now ?
We're close enough now .
You mean you don't even want to hear my side ?
And I understand perfectly his sneering reference to my wilder days .
If you and I don't value her equally , it would be better for us to work out our differences without her .
Has she already forgotten her brave husband , Prince Edward , whom I stabbed on the battlefield three months ago in my anger ?
I'll stop at every house .
I would rather listen to my dog bark at a crow than hear a man swear that he loves me .
Then I heard the trumpets blow twice , and left him there in a trance .
But aren't you drowned , Stephano ?
Play the kind of music that puts people to sleep .
I'll be back here with you by two o'clock .
Damn it , shut your mouth .
Come on , show me the wound that my eyes have caused .
I will pause for a reply .
Sir , I tell you that we are not .
What's that trumpet for ?
And whoever lives to see that day Will walk with his feet .
Do you know him ?
I enchanted them so thoroughly that they followed me through thorn bushes and prickly shrubs that tore up their shins .
God bless you for doing this .
How do you feel , Laertes ?
I'm off to Venice to buy outfits for the wedding .
Lead the way .
If you refuse it , the whole country will regret it .
What is it , Laertes ?
Speak .
Drive it out of you .
I demand to be satisfied .
I'll just speak a word or two here in the house and then I'll go with you .
Go and tell them this .
You , who are neither honest nor good .
We're three of them .
You , sir , where's my daughter ?
Antony .
As
Look , here comes the duke .
Close , soft eyes .
Then Desdemona and Othello will go back to Venice .
Give me your hand , first .
We thought you ought to know about it .
What news can you tell me in this fast-moving , unsteady state of ours ?
No , please , speak seriously .
The money you owe me for the necklace .
Hopefully when I get married , I'll give my husband half my love and half my sense of duty .
No , keep going , old man ; don't stop like that .
It's a reason for suspicion , even though it's just a dream .
The nasty devil's biting my butt .
If luck's with me , I'll lose a father , and you'll lose a daughter .
Let's send this news to Rome .
Go tell your generals to hurry their preparations .
Moonshine and Lion are left to bury the dead .
Oh Banquo , Banquo , the king has been murdered !
Everyone keeps yelling , "Here they come ! " Our castle is strong enough to laugh off their seige .
We'll revenge his death .
Good !
Reluctantly , I agreed-alas !
Will you abandon such gentle lambs , God , and throw them to the wolves ?
Look , his noble blood is still on it .
What's going on , Horatio ?
It has hatched a I go unwillingly .
Good luck , worthy soldier , and good-bye .
How much does he owe the Jew ?
Tell me who shall have the better luck , Caesar or me ?
Oh , Tranio , until it happened to me , I never would have thought it possible .
God give him health .
Well , enough about them. , Come here , Catesby .
His running away has everything to do with fear and nothing to do with love .
But now it's stopped .
Clever lies .
It would be better if you actually applied it to your life .
Then go gather your men , but leave behind your son , George Stanley .
Please calm down , uncle .
I like to pretend you are , because then it's almost like actually talking to her .
Take her to my tent .
He's still sleeping , ma'am .
You taught me language , and all I can do with it is curse .
They've eaten themselves sick .
There's little or nothing of that .
Do what he says , William .
Play , trumpets !
Yes , my lord .
Let your thoughts make up for our imperfections .
Buckingham himself has wandered away alone to who knows where .
Stop her !
Exactly like that .
You need to .
Why did you carry these daggers out of the room ?
We told him we wouldn't even let him bury his men until he retreated to Saint Colme's Inch and paid us ten thousand dollars .
Good-bye then , until the time I see you dressed in your battle gear , which will suit you both very well .
It's my exercise time .
Well , then , here it is : you must prepare yourself for his knife .
Well , time will tell .
She's very moral .
Yes , and he's been carried off the field .
It's a deal !
But I slip from underneath her and she falls down , crying , "Ow , my butt ! " and starts coughing , and then everyone laughs and has fun .
But they're siding with a better wrestler than myself .
You're alive .
They can't have changed ; there's no way this could be true .
You evil whore !
Then tell them to treat us well .
Didn't they ever whisper ?
There's a spirit in here !
Did you hear the news that's going around ?
It'd be better to be delirious and unaware of anything .
You are all most welcome here ; please make yourselves at home .
Maybe I'll never go home again , Iago !
Her father loves you , Demetrius .
Let four captains carry Hamlet like a soldier onto the stage .
You certainly made me believe you did , my lord .
I'm going to rest my head on this little slope .
Why , so did you .
Sadness and despair !
I'll be more jealous of you than a wild rooster over his hen ; more noisy than a parrot chattering about the rain ; more fond of new things than an ape ; more giddy about getting what I want than a monkey .
Therefore my sadness is without limit .
He's slept a long time .
I owe you a lot , and like a spoiled kid I've lost what I owe you .
Duke , the abbess has wronged me and I seek justice .
Run , everyone , run !
Where's my fool ?
Arm yourself .
You say he's friendly with Caesar , healthy , and free .
Amen to that !
We won't go today , or any day until it's clear that it shall be whatever time I say it is .
Oh , sirs , if I stirred your hearts and minds to mutiny and rage , I would offend Brutus and Cassius , who , you all know , are honorable men .
I'll see them safely married first and then hurry back to my master's .
I hope so too , Madam .
Enough of this frivolous talk .
Oh , one child is one too many !
Sweet mistress , I don't know what other name to give you , or how you've figured out mine , you seem as
You should always be honest .
I met him in the street , he was there with that man .
When his god falls asleep , the monster will snatch his wine bottle .
Here , I give you my blessing again .
And as surely as I am alive , I am a virgin .
I wish to God that the golden crown that I'll have to wear were red-hot steel and burned me straight through to the brain !
What should I do ?
Is he in his royal garments ?
Then I'll know exactly what she is , just as I know what I am .
Lysander I want to stop , but Hermia stops my heart from beating .
You're thinking something .
Do whatever you like with it .
I can't even be sure these are my hands .
He'll grow up to be a proper man .
What are you doing ?
No , it'd be a sin to think such a low thought .
Doesn't anyone else want to see this , and hear breath wheezing out from broken ribs ?
Sunday is just around the corner .
And you will be , or some people here will suffer for it .
I don't know , " he said , "any house , wife , or mistress." My message , which was supposed to be delivered with my mouth , ended up being carried back home by my shoulders .
The king has broken his heart .
No , they're busy and as excellent as ever .
Here's my servant .
Everything's OK .
Tell us when you wish to get married , and may God give you joy .
Sir , fifteen days of March have gone by .
Kneel down to the duke before he passes by the abbey .
Corporal Nym , be a man and put away your sword .
Good girl , give it to me .
And now you know my meaning .
If I can't have an estate by birthright , then I'll get it by being clever .
Back then , I called you "a poor , imitation queen , " a badly reproduced copy of what I was , a pretty prologue for the tragedy that was about to follow , a woman who was lifted high only to be hurled down to hell , a mother only teased with two beautiful children , who would soon die .
Companions in sorrow alleviate our grief .
Were you drunk when you seemed so hopeful before ?
Let's follow him , Gertrude .
Come on .
I'm not sure it's true , but just the suspicion is enough for me .
I was engaged to both of them .
A lovely , cunning shore can distract a man from the perils of a stormy sea , just as a pretty scarf can hide a dangerous dark-skinned beauty .
That her father's brother wants to be her husband ?
Never a moment of peace !
Send me away , my lord , but don't kill me !
What , everybody falls asleep so fast ?
He's near death , and Roderigo's dead already .
A deed that will make sick men healthy .
It takes a good priest to practice what he preaches .
No , my good lord .
Away with the doddering fool !
That's what I said when I first conjured the tempest .
Double , double toil and trouble , Fire burn and cauldron bubble .
Go ahead , but I won't listen .
It's gone .
Buck up , boy !
Now I'm scared again .
We'll have supper in the morning .
As you know , next Sunday my daughter Katherina is to be married .
What , are you mocking me to my face ?
It's always like this in times of change .
Come here , Tyrrel .
I think you are .
Descend .
Take away this lout and whip him .
Signor Brabantio , hey !
Can you remember the time before you came to live in this shack ?
No , you monstrous hags , I'll get revenge on you both that will make the whole world, I will do such things , I don't know what I'll do exactly , but it'll be devastating .
There are things in this comedy of Pyramus and Thisbe that will never work .
I was born to speak cleverly , not seriously .
Good Lord , what a clown you are !
You are nothing like Mark Antony !
Monster , I'll kill this man .
The only possible interest I could take in you would be to hit you on the head with a stool , paint your face with blood , and make a fool out of you .
Draw your sword !
A nice , soft pillow would be a more suitable place to lay that good white head than France's hard , cold ground .
I'm sure you aren't Launcelot , my boy .
And have I ever seemed less than modest or appropriate to you ?
Well , I don't .
While I stood spellbound , messengers from the king arrived and greeted me as the thane of Cawdor , which is precisely how the weird sisters had saluted me before calling me 'the future king !
Do you recognize this face ?
He's very bright .
The crowd that follows Caesar at his heels , senators , justices , common petitioners , will suffocate a feeble man almost to death .
Little" again ?
Not yet .
And now he's gone .
She's still at the monastery , kneeling and praying for a happy marriage .
Since if the sun breeds maggots on a dead dog , kissing the corpse , by the way , do you have a daughter ?
And that's all there is to it .
Come on , let's get to the banquet .
I'll leave you , lady .
And that's how I'll turn her good intentions into a big trap to snag them all .
Are Englishmen really such heavy drinkers ?
I can only do it by lying , my lord , but I can do it so secretly that no one will suspect me .
You do me wrong by taking me out of the grave .
I have a daughter named Katherina , sir .
You did it ?
Not for your entire fairy kingdom. , Come , fairies , let's go .
Can any of your neighbors tell , Kate ?
And that's how my brother robbed me of my life , my crown , and my queen all at once .
What , not a word ?
Amen .
What a righteous judge !
When the vision passes , you'll see that you're just looking at a stool .
You are right , it's for my mistress .
Come back to my house with me .
Are you crazy ?
Or stole it , rather .
What do you say to a calf's foot ?
See that it is done , and prepare a feast for the soldiers .
I might come back soon .
Get busy , go !
And what did Surrey say to that ?
Did they make you the messenger ?
Whether your mouth is black or white , Do-dee , dee-dee da .
Yes , please tell me .
We are men , my lord .
Heaven commanded Nature To fill her one body With all the graces that women contain .
What did your song mean , lady ?
What a miserable and obstinate fellow this king of England is , to blunder with his fat-headed followers so far beyond his capacity .
You left him out in the storm in the black night , bareheaded , a storm so terrible that if it had happened at sea , the waters would have risen up and extinguished the fire burning in the stars .
Ate at home ?
But Lysander's so attractive that he's turned heaven into hell !
Check the calendar and come tell me .
Yes , sir .
It was worse than being a captive in chains .
I'm a fool. , Let's go , Lorenzo. , Goodbye for now .
Once again you bring good news .
You don't need a ghost returning from the grave to tell you that , sir .
Things are what they are .
Suffolk died first , and York , cut to pieces , came to him where he lay in his blood and took him by the face , kissing his gashes .
My Italy is full of civil war .
My dear sir !
Is he sane ?
I figure that once he's crippled me , I'll beg by showing off my beatings .
There's no bravery in an unfair fight .
And where's Cordelia ? , Do you see this , Kent ?
Yes , but not out of fear .
I plan to fall into the blackest despair .
Spring , summer , fertile autumn and angry winter have all changed places , and now the confused world doesn't know which is which .
Oh , that's not true , my lord .
What would that be ?
I'll tell you privately .
Escape and make peace with Caesar .
There's a ransom .
Would you ever do such a thing for all the world ?
Here .
It's Brabantio .
Give me a cup of wine .
I hear someone coming .
Where's your servant
What , am I being denied death , as well ?
Gouge out his eyes !
And if you rattle on about mountains , then let them throw millions of acres over us .
There is no rest to be had in any bedroom where you are !
Carry me , good friends , to where Cleopatra is .
How strange that they all got so sleepy !
Look how she rubs her hands .
No .
Othello , have one of your officers stay behind to bring you your commission and whatever else is important to you .
That's what he says .
I'll try to persuade him to put on something more appropriate before going to the church , if it's at all possible .
What did he say ?
So do all thoughts .
She dropped it carelessly , and , seizing the opportunity , since I was here , I picked it up .
If you're as good at pleading to them as I am at saying no to you , this will definitely come to a happy end .
No , he was wicked and vile .
I'll cross myself .
He refuses , as he is free of vanity and self-serving pride and ascribes all the glory and responsibility for victory to God .
No , not until we see a hot January .
I've often given money to people who were unable to pay back their loans to him .
The best news of all is that we've located our king and our men .
I'm out of patience .
Every one of us is a criminal .
That way , the maiden that stood between me and them shall be the means of my achieving my desire .
Oh well , God's in charge , and some people have to go to heaven , while other people have to go to hell .
First of all , my house in the city , as you know , is filled with expensive furniture and household articles , china and gold , basins and pitchers for her to wash her dainty hands in .
Then you might as well say they're not dead .
Oh , how fortunate that horse is to have Antony on him .
Here's the east .
I've promised them I would , and they're expecting it .
Please stop turning me around .
A lot of words .
Edmund is dead , my lord .
Good gentlemen , look like you're rested and happy .
I loved him , as much as any father ever loved his son .
Don't push him too far .
Would you like to hear some music , my sweet love ?
To put it plainly , I'm afraid I'm not quite sane .
Meanwhile , I'll make a list of props that we'll need for the play .
Even if you had your eyes , you still might not recognize me .
So then why should I offer this womanish defense that I'm innocent ?
Dear God , please make him normal again !
I'll wait on them with all respect and duty .
What part of her body is Ireland ?
True , " she said , "a fine little one." "No , " I said , "a huge wit." "Right , " she said , "a hugely awful one." "No , " I said , "he has a good wit." "Exactly , " she said , "it's good and mild ; it doesn't hurt anyone." "No , " I said , "Benedick is wise." "He is certainly , " she said , She cried a lot at that , and said she didn't care .
What a long night this is !
There are tears for his love , joy for his fortune , honor for his bravery , and death for his ambition .
Quiet !
Oh , it was a monstrous roar , to make the earth tremble !
Tell the army to flee .
It bothers me , though , that these poor spotted innocents , who , after all , are this deserted city's native citizens , should be gouged with arrows .
Give me another horse !
It means peace and love and a quiet life , supremacy based on reverence and profound respect , and , not to go on and on about it , everything that's sweet and happy .
And what would that accomplish ?
Let's draw our own swords too .
A tailor made you .
Yes .
Did you see him enter this abbey ?
They did want me to tell her , but I persuaded them that , if they truly loved Benedick , they would try to get him to battle his emotions and keep Beatrice in the dark .
Amen .
Sir , here's the Queen .
Who's dead ?
This is what Calphurnia's dream means .
If Well , I'll just forget the difficulties of my situation , in order to focus on the happiness of yours .
Not a second more .
If that's true , then don't be tongue-tied .
Look , love , see how devoted I am ?
Leave me for a bit .
I hate the Moor , and there's a widespread rumor that he's slept with my wife .
Yes , it faded away when the rooster crowed .
Who heard me do that ?
Who does it stand still for ?
I won't answer that .
Locked in her tomb .
Word is that Richmond is the navy's admiral .
I don't know how .
Yes , sir , they're ready .
But I don't think it'll hurt him to tell the truth .
People who are either too serious or too silly are awful .
That's our offer .
If this business would really be finished when I did the deed , then it would be best to get it over with quickly .
You were wrong to give away your wife's first gift so thoughtlessly , a thing you swore to keep on your finger and bound faithfully to your body .
Prison , my lord ?
Get out of my face .
Now I'll ask Cassio about Bianca , a prostitute who sells her body for food and clothes .
Here in the tent .
I'll pick berries for you .
A big blast of wind shook our fortifications .
Are you starting to challenge me ?
Take on someone your own size : if you kill me , boy , you'll have killed a man .
Look , here comes the woman you love .
If we were in front of our armies , about to fight , I would do this .
Before I open this letter , please tell me how my good friend is doing .
Don't ask me to talk about it .
I'm afraid he will .
Remember March , March 15th .
He'll be like this for a little while .
How awful !
Lovell , go as fast as you can to Doctor Shaw .
Shake my hand .
Get lost , will you ?
Your other daughter Regan will treat you kindly , you'll see .
Hamlet." Dutifully and obediently my daughter showed me this letter , and more like it .
Yes , and that's a serious failing .
It isn't daybreak yet .
Have a good morning .
No , it's true , or if it's not , I'm a villain .
You'd make a good fool .
It's a big prize for such a small sin .
Only until noon , my lord ?
Bring Desdemona here .
Lucillius and Titinius , order the commanders to have the men camp for the night .
I'll go wait for Dromio at the marketplace .
You'll "never trust his word again." Come on , that was a stupid thing to say .
Well , but what time is it ?
He's not jealous ?
Truly , no , no more than is reasonable .
He's already done so .
I am dying , Cleopatra , dying .
Look how far that little candle sends its light !
I'd rather have my horse than a mistress .
Who's going to keep me from them ?
That word "judgment" makes me feel a bit guilty .
No , to the Whitefriars monastery .
I'll look for some way to leave his service .
But in this case of wooing , a child shall father his own father , if my wits don't fail me .
Most noble Antony !
Say welcome to all of our friends for me , sir , for in my heart they are all welcome .
Well , I disagree .
No , if you struggle with me , Just half an hour !
Yes , God be praised , I have managed to earn his favor .
Go disguise yourself as a sea nymph .
Therefore , love and tongue-tied simplicity can say the most even when they're saying the least , in my opinion .
Draw your sword and give me enough blows to kill me .
All right .
God pardon those who are responsible for Clarence's troubles .
With all my heart , I'll join you .
Oh , please , tell us , sir .
Come , Katherine Queen of All , reveal your heart to me in broken English .
But , oh , heavenly Rosalind !
Who are you , moaning in the hut like that ?
Give me some trinket of yours , and I will wear it in my hat .
I never saw him like this before .
Then see a good one for me .
In the meantime , come home with me , and when the time is right I'll take you to talk to him .
Will it be chased away by bowing and scraping ?
Hurry , go up to the roof .
Her father is Baptista Minola , a pleasant and courteous gentleman .
Listen a minute .
Are there magic spells that can lead young virgins astray ?
What !
Well , for your good looks , sir , thank God and don't boast about it .
Are you behind some bush ?
My husband is dead .
All hail , Macbeth !
Everything that made me worry about my ships would make me sad .
Once she exclaimed , "Sisters , sisters , shame on you !
How is my noble lord ?
Cousin , you didn't used to be so thickheaded .
It's mine , sir .
You know why I think so ?
I have no gift for the one and no strength for the other , though I have the gift of strength .
No , if I had power I would take world peace and throw it down to hell .
May good fortune come to you , good Petruchio !
Winter garments need to be filled with something , And so does skinny Rosalind .
Oh , you men are made of stone !
But since I've gotten myself involved this far , because I'm so stupidly honest and because I like you so much , I'll keep going .
Sure , and twenty others just like you .
Go escort the lords of France and Burgundy , Gloucester .
Well , I'll go hide the body in some hole until the duke gives orders for his burial .
What is the tyrant Macbeth doing ?
I'll beat him until the welts look like basket-weave !
To repay her for her troubles , Death Gives her undying fame .
Run , run , oh , run !
He was my friend , he was faithful and just to me .
He looks humbler than he used to .
If you take it too seriously , it'll have bad effects that I didn't want it to have .
Always give him his way .
Shame on you , you slanderer !
I couldn't see you , Lysander , but I heard your voice , and that's how I found you .
With no more ceremony than that ?
Why don't you answer me , man ?
No , that I don't remember .
I'm afraid to think how I'll be criticized for letting my natural affection for my father give way to my loyalty to you .
Then I could stop wondering , and find some other career .
She's dead , I think. , Help , uncle ! , Hero , why Hero !
No .
What's going on , Rosalind ?
Think about it .
As I was working on one musty room , the Prince and Claudio entered .
I don't think so .
When I opened my eyes , I saw their swords out .
Nothing .
Look , here comes someone who loves me , along with someone who loves her .
No , I didn't say that .
Caesar might act like that .
Your Grace can do whatever he wants .
Everything about this is unnatural !
Cheer up .
The ghost is definitely something to worry about .
Let go of me .
Oh do-de , do-de , do-de .
Haven't you made your other love , Demetrius , who kicked me with his foot not long ago , call me a goddess and a divine , rare , precious , heavenly creature ?
When you ask for my blessing , I'll get down on my knees and ask you to forgive me .
Please , sir , be patient .
How is my generous sister ?
Even if he were as important a man as the devil , as Lucifer or Beelzebub himself , he's required , see , your Grace , to keep his vow .
Look at him .
If my eyes don't deceive me , you are my Rosalind .
Caesar and Lepidus declared war against Pompey .
Oh , is that Kent ?
Whore , your lover's dead now , and you'll be going to hell soon .
Oh , really ?
Have some patience , please .
Then a third of the world is drunk .
Can't you see that ?
I won't beg the gods to punish you , or caution you to fear their judgment .
Stay here at your own risk .
Before he leaves this part of the forest , you'll change places : you'll be the one running away , and he'll be in love with you .
Well , I'm going to break in .
Come on , sir , will you come aboard ?
By this token , you'll be admitted to their cell .
Here's more news .
Come on , I'll fight you .
Know the glove !
I don't know what you're talking about .
If I'm killed , it will only be the death of a man who was willing to be dead .
You are a fool. , You , niece , prepare to leave .
If you wish .
You never heard of the Centaur ?
There's nothing to fear in him .
Oh , Antony , Antony , Antony !
Early in the morning I'll go visit Desdemona and plead my case .
See , I've sealed his fate with this mark next to his name .
Go away now and in the morning meet me in the pit by the river in hell .
I'll do what I can , more than I'd do for myself .
The duke of Gloucester , who has command over the siege , is in consultation with an Irishman , a very valiant gentleman indeed .
Come on , "nothing" will get you nothing .
So I'm free .
Just let me follow behind you , even though I'm not good enough for you .
Follow her .
I've been informed by certain sources I can't disclose that your younger brother Orlando plans to fight me in disguise .
Did you see anything ?
Find a father who loved his child as overwhelmingly as I loved Hero and ask
I don't know .
No .
Such a wonderful father-in-law and wife make this place a paradise .
And there comes Caesar .
Nothing , my lord .
Phoebe wrote it .
She'll be buried with her face upwards , then .
What a miracle !
Heaven knows I am .
What should we say , my lord ?
Why , you're absolutely right , cousin .
You won't regret this .
What you told me it haunts me like a nightmare , he's got my handkerchief !
I won't bet on whether or not any of this is real .
Help me , angels !
Yes , my lord .
And as wise as a goose .
Am I all alone ?
If you want to come have dinner with me , you can .
Usually that means a person is foolish .
The pig or the mighty or the huge or the magnanimous , they all mean the same thing , with some variation .
I humbly thank you , sir .
Good running , Thisbe !
You have to be patient , madam .
He can't possibly be such a monster , And I'm sure he isn't .
Indeed , my lord , he is a perfectly wonderful horse .
A friend should put up with his friend's weaknesses , but you exaggerate mine .
Something's wrong , the man sounds panicked .
This is an asp's trail , and these fig leaves have slime on them , just like the kind that asps deposit on the caves by the Nile .
I'm not a slut , I keep myself clean , but I thank God I am ugly .
Sing it tonight .
Honest to God , where's the sexton ?
You're taking it more seriously than I meant it .
Really ?
Please , come with me .
No thank you , my lord .
Do you know any , count ?
Good morning , Kate , for I hear that's what you're called .
Wasn't Don John at dinner tonight ?
We already knew that .
I will not confess it to you nor to anyone else , because there was no one else to witness her speech .
When the barrel's empty , we'll drink water .
This stormy night will turn us all into fools and madmen .
My lord , the queen wants to speak with you right away .
A man named Iago , the general's ensign .
Put the goblets of wine on that table .
I remember a jumble of impressions , but nothing distinctly .
Take revenge for his horrible murder , that crime against nature .
I order you to come with me .
My darling , when I gave my love to you , I told you that all the wealth I had ran within my veins , that I have noble blood , but no money .
Friends , go .
There is an emergency I must take care of , but my whole heart will remain here with you .
I have only come in , like the others have , to try to fight him with the strength of my youth .
Do you think I would be feeling as triumphant as I am if I didn't know that our situation was secure ?
Go find him .
It's too much .
You teach me how I should act .
But , oh no !
I'm game .
Good luck .
What do you have to say , noble friend ?
Take it to your master and bring him home immediately .
Tranio , I think I've got it !
In that case , leave our cousin Katherine here with us .
I'm just stating the facts as I see them .
He's talking with the bogus father about the bogus son .
I've got some business to take care of .
It's very strange .
But you heard him swear up and down that he was .
But we'll obey .
I'll yield my legions and cavalry to Caesar .
I have to leave right away .
No , I won't cry any more .
He just said that they're no good at acting .
I'm torn .
Take them away .
Would you rather hear these things from our mouths or from our master's ?
He once said the devil would get him because of women .
Oh , I can buy twenty husbands at any market .
And she's fierce , even though she's little .
Your words have moved me , and maybe it'll do some good .
I didn't do anything .
He says I won't get into heaven because I'm a Jew's daughter , and he says you're irresponsible because by converting Jews to Christianity you're raising the price of pork .
I do , and it sounds like you're talking in your sleep .
And he told us to follow him to the temple .
We haven't been able to meet on a hill or in a valley , in the forest or a meadow , by a pebbly fountain or a rushing stream , or on the beach by the ocean without you disturbing us .
Hail !
I believe it .
Please , do so .
Good Cinna , take this paper and be sure to lay it in the judge's chair where Brutus sits , so he'll find it .
They were nearly killing each other , as you saw when you pulled them apart .
Am I a married man or a bachelor ?
Yes , we will .
Alas , he is too young .
I've been singing ever since you made your daughters into your mothers by giving them all your power .
Take it easy !
You told me they escaped into this forest .
Damn him !
My man , monster is so drunk he can't talk .
If you say that , you bastard , you'll kill your Queen .
So young and so cruel ?
That's the truth , sir .
I was too young at the time to appreciate her value , but now I know her .
Please tell me seriously what you think of her .
Here lies Hero , The heroic maiden killed by slanderous words .
You know where she is .
Stand still .
I can stand well enough , and I can speak just fine .
Finally the new moon , curved like a silver bow in the sky , will look down on our wedding celebration .
Are you really saying these things , or am I dreaming ?
She provoked me with her lying mouth , accusing me of crimes I didn't commit .
Until then , I'll walk around town , peruse the markets , and gaze upon the buildings , and then I'll return and sleep at the inn .
Who's coming here ?
One servant cried , "God bless us ! " and the other replied , "Amen , " as if they had seen my bloody hands .
Live in the moment .
And what will happen if I don't ?
His insane period is over .
May heaven save us from indecent thoughts !
Who are you ?
Too bad it fell flat .
the way trainers do with young hawks that flutter and flap and will not obey .
Has there ever been a time , I'd really like to know , when I've definitely said something was true , and it turned out not to be true ?
A very candid reply .
Only men whom you wouldn't trust anyway would swear oaths , and for the worst reasons .
Oh , if I've got any influence over you at all , please patch things up with him .
Tunis has never had such a beautiful queen .
I'll go straight for that proverb with "To hell with the devil." You are better at proverbs than I am by as much as "A fool shoots quickly and overshoots his mark." You have overshot .
It's often the case that having something makes us spoiled , while not having it turns out to be advantageous .
So I won't give or risk anything for lead .
Is the king awake , worthy thane ?
Honestly , you're speaking the truth , ever since the fools were With his mouth full of news .
Do you want me to lie , madam ?
Well then , leave them alone until they're sober .
That's enough .
No , it would be better to speak first and kiss only after you've run out of things to say .
Why are you doing this ?
Go get some water and wash this bloody evidence from your hands .
I've become an enemy to my own soldiers !
Look at Macbeth , he's in a daze .
Assemble our squadrons on the other side of the hill , in sight of Caesar's navy .
Me too .
Alas , our poor country !
I was conceived by a woman , and I thank her very much for all her effort .
I should go to the barber's , monsieur , because I think I'm getting really hairy around the face .
Go ahead , say "Amen." No more talking .
Don't ask me anything .
Lorenzo , that's for sure , and I'm also sure you're my love , who else do I love so much ?
How can you square things with me ?
It's good we had this meeting .
Then it must be Banquo's .
His father , if I do say so myself , is an honest but very poor man , and , thank God , likely to live a long time .
Are you going to start eating worms and flies ?
Amen to that .
Rob them of the ability to count before the numbers against them overwhelm their courage .
She says all the right things , but the dumbest brothel-keeper would tell the same story .
You were born from a woman .
If it's for me , don't keep it from me .
He was dressed so oddly too !
Why , too much freedom leads to woe .
Will you marry her ?
Good night , ladies , good night , sweet ladies , good night , good night .
Wake up , I say !
Thank you , master .
Any villain in Denmark is going to be , well , a villain .
If not , I'll leave you alone and that'll be the end of my business .
I'll bandage up these wounds and swear I got them in the French wars .
That will never happen .
It only looks a little paler .
That's the consideration that makes us stretch out our sufferings so long .
Where do you live , pretty young man ?
He didn't say anything , he's reading .
My grandmother told me he was murdered there .
Though that must have been a pitiful sight , the ground looked beautiful .
We have no friends but determination and the quickest death .
Now please , tell Beatrice to come out .
He didn't ask questions , but answered ours at length .
Sir , I leave you to your own contentment .
Well , sir , it's true it came soon after .
This is the roof under which Lorenzo said to meet him .
I want all such offenders to be dealt with that way , and I give precise orders that in our progress through the country there shall be nothing seized from the villages , nothing taken that is not paid for , none of the French harassed or abused in disrespectful language .
The old king was so overjoyed by this promise that he gave young Fortinbras an annual income of three thousand I like this news , and when I have time I'll read this and think about how to reply .
This king is a branch of that same victorious stock .
In order to find a mother and a brother , I too have lost myself , unhappily .
What's there to say ?
Is your other mouth calling my name ?
But why do you keep me here so long ?
Now go , set up for dinner .
You are not as happy as Macbeth , yet much happier .
Enough , Captain .
Yes , noble lord .
Is that the naked guy ?
Yes , if Messala recommends me to you .
He's trembling in his fit !
No , absolutely not .
Why are you talking about robbery ?
Come here , Ventidius .
I was his daughter when you banished him .
Once there , make your thoughts work harder , and witness a siege .
I was told that you were violent , proud , and sullen .
Call that servant back .
Well , you've given away all your other rightful titles .
But the critics and I found it to be an excellent play , with well-ordered scenes that were clever but not fancy .
I don't know , sir .
I tell you truly , in true English : I love you , Kate .
Bring me some light , gentlemen , I'll bind the wound with my shirt .
I see you don't intend to part with her , or perhaps you don't like my company .
You'll do no such thing .
Our hour is up .
Run and proclaim it in the streets .
How are you , Roderigo ?
When she was dying she gave it to me and told me to give it to my wife when I got married .
He leaps from the ground as if his insides were light as hairs .
To be honest , I don't know why I'm so sad .
We both have eaten as well , and we can both endure the cold winter as well as he .
Cassio's been wounded .
No , not for all of Venice .
If you interrupt it , he'll foam at the mouth and go crazy .
Oh Clitus !
I swear by the mass , before I close my eyes to go to sleep , I'll put in some good fighting , or I'll lie in the ground dead .
There isn't enough leek left for you to swear on .
Why would you have me betray the truth of my emotions and make my love wander in some other direction ?
wise and graceful as the earth is wonderful and divine .
I'm speaking for the king , but I look like myself .
March to meet him at a dignified pace .
Therefore , all lovers should speak for themselves .
I tried to play games with God , and he turned my fake prayer on my head , giving me for real what I'd asked for as a joke .
Well , then , be brave and pretend to be a man .
Whatever you are , thanks for your advice .
I wish you could !
These were sweet omens !
Is he attacking the heartland of Poland or some frontier ?
Make Cassio angry somehow , either by speaking too loud , or insulting his military skills , or however else you want .
Listen up , you slave .
But , unfortunately , Caesar has to bleed if we're going to stop him .
I've told you I'm your friend , and I'll stick by you .
That's how it was with Henry the Sixth , who was crowned in Paris when he was only nine months old .
But please , forgive me , your highness .
Tell me , do I have your consent to kill them ?
Name one .
Although you deserve praise , applause , and love , right now the duke misconstrues everything you've done .
Caesar and he are better friends than ever .
What's the message from the English king ?
Please , just walk with me a little ways , and tell me if I'll see you later tonight .
Hail !
And just in time , here he comes with Sir Richard Ratcliffe .
My sister is all those things , or else she should be .
Father is on the lookout .
I'll go as fast as I can , madam .
Here comes my lord .
No one's life should have been entrusted to them .
This little prank of hers is going to cost me .
You can hope your father isn't your real father .
Thank you , sir .
When you see leeks in the future , I hope you keep mocking them .
What is making our eyes and ears act so strangely ?
But when push comes to shove , they droop like those horses that are all show and slow to a crawl .
Treat me well .
I don't know her , but I know her father and he knew mine well .
Look , I have a weapon , the best sword a soldier could have .
Abandon the person that has abandoned himself .
I am resolved , to let him live .
And you won't until the needy eat .
He won't have a chance .
Don't talk to me .
I swear , sir , you did not eat at home .
Darling Kate !
Imagine the French ambassador returning to inform Harry that the king offers him
make your eyes jump out of their sockets , and your hair stand on end like porcupine quills .
I'll go get them , sir .
I swear the only ransom will be these bones of mine .
Tell me the truth .
That's not what I wish .
Any minute .
This was the basket .
I think that on a night like this , when the wind blew the trees so gently that they didn't make a sound , On a night like this , On a night like this , On a night like this ,
Are you lovebirds only starting to pair up now ?
Yes , it's just clothing .
Is that called for in the contract ?
Do you know who I am ?
I've come to say farewell to my king and master .
Good night , lieutenant .
Let me sit down .
Where did he get wine ?
My own house , good lady .
Don't bother with it .
Where do you live ?
For that reason he sends you this good news , that this very day your enemies , the queen's relatives , will die at Pomfret .
How dangerous to have this madman on the loose !
And everyone can say "welcome , " which is just a word .
And do you see how much your foolish wife means to him ?
There is no indication of the mighty army that surrounds them in his expression , nor has the long , sleepless night robbed his face of an ounce of color .
A snake did do it , because no snake ever had a more forked , lying tongue than you have .
When he loses that , he'll be drinking salt water , since I'll never tell him where the freshwater springs are .
I know because I dreamed of money bags last night .
I could do a great job with Hercules , or any other part that requires ranting and raving .
But are you sure that Benedick loves Beatrice that much ?
I hope you both get drenched with a dew as evil as what my mother used to collect with a crow's feather from the poison swamps .
Herald , spare yourself .
The word is too good to represent her wickedness .
The general should be informed about this .
Yes , please ; unleash your wisdom .
What a worthy man !
You'll just have to be patient for a little while .
I don't think about them now .
Come , shall we hunt some deer for dinner ?
Good advice , indeed .
I ran into her recently at the edge of the forest , looking for sweet presents for this hateful idiot , and I scolded her and argued with her .
He'll never agree to that .
Wait !
Antipholus owes me the exact amount that I owe you .
Now I go , a jolly , thriving wooer , to marry my brother Edward's young daughter , Elizabeth , because I know Richmond has his eye on her .
Where will the old duke live ?
I'm good at everything that ordinary men can do .
Let those who would mar this fair land's peace with treason die before they can enjoy its wealth .
If you complain any more , I'll split an oak tree and lock you up in it till you've howled for twelve years .
I'm your daughter .
Kate , my wooing is fit for your understanding : I am glad your English isn't better .
Lord , what fools these mortals are !
I swear , at the moment I really couldn't tell you how I ended up here .
Has he asked for me ?
It's nothing , my lord .
For my brother Edward's sake .
A worthy fool !
And no one eat any onions or garlic .
You come here with letters against the king , and you take his conceited daughter's side against his royal highness .
Really , the priest was good enough , no matter what that old guy said .
And you're not loyal , like us .
Sir , the king , Yes , what about him ?
But where did this happen ?
Let's leave him .
Their names are marked .
Let's go gather our jewels and money .
Watch her .
What , was I married to her in a dream ?
Well , is it not news that Petruchio's coming ?
I would have been what I am even if the most virginal star in the heavens had twinkled at my conception .
I'm going to get my Please , listen to me .
I don't love Hermia ; I love Helena .
Then if he dies , his death serves him .
Let's go !
Friar !
Come , warble for me .
Everything's fine .
Oh , stop , fool .
What did he say the symptoms were ?
He said he did , I don't know .
Show us the way .
We have God and a good cause on our side .
You said those exact things to me back in the marketplace .
Mutton ?
Please , corporal , stop !
Ever since I arrived here , just now , I've been hearing strange rumors .
where it takes on some other horrible form that drives you insane .
Even if you were as handsome as I beg your highness' pardon .
Tom's chilly .
If we aren't relieved in an hour , we have to return to our barracks .
Yes , sir , I have .
How can we avoid what the gods want to happen ?
Who wants to buy the flock and the pasture ?
He's an unremarkable man , fit only to be sent on errands .
I could have sworn he trampled on me .
Who's his lieutenant , do you know ?
If you get what you want and you're still not happy , you've spent everything and gained nothing .
Please , dear , calm down .
It's something , it's nothing : it's yours , it's mine , and it'll belong to thousands more .
Anyway , even if he had the money now , the Jew probably wouldn't take it .
Go now , and pretend to be a friendly hostess .
If you can love a man of this temperament , Kate , whose face a sunburn wouldn't make any worse and who never looks in the mirror to admire himself , let your eye improve me .
If you can love me for this , take me .
Evil spirit , I want to talk some more .
Or did the letter make him emotional somehow , and this is the first time he's done it ?
I've never been your enemy .
I'll drink to Hamlet's health , and into his goblet I'll drop a pearl even more costly than those in the crowns of the last four Danish kings .
He's calling us back .
I won't be satisfied until I get even with him , wife for wife .
Yes , sir .
Hitting his wife ?
If he can keep it , he'll be set forever .
Wake up my whole household !
Look who's coming : a young man and an old man , having a serious talk .
Caesar ?
The gentleman who serves you only for profit And is only superficially loyal to you Will take off when it starts to rain And leave you alone in the storm .
My name's Stephano , and I've come to tell you my mistress will arrive here at Belmont before sunrise .
I know the people of Venice well .
Take it away .
I don't care .
We will .
Listen to that Petruchio : she says she'll see you hanged first .
I'll keep your words of wisdom close to my heart .
She was here just now .
I want very much to find out .
You have seen the cruel proof of this man's strength .
There must be something in the air here .
Come on , woo me , woo me .
Let's go !
Katherine the shrew ! " That's the worst thing you can call a young woman .
Signor Montano , your brave and loyal servant , gives you this information and asks you to send reinforcements to relieve him .
Well , call them back again .
The cowslip flowers are her bodyguards .
If you meet the Prince in the night , you can order him to stop .
What's he talking about ?
No , it's certain , Iras .
I said she was .
They call this "the argumentative countercheck." And so on through "the circumstantial lie" and "the direct lie." And how many times did you say his beard wasn't cut well ?
Boy !
Wait !
Come along , though .
Obey your parents , keep your word , don't swear , don't sleep with another man's wife , and don't covet flashy clothes .
He won't listen to anyone's advice .
This story breaks my heart .
Hey , Cassio !
I recognize his walk .
Or if you've got some buried treasure somewhere , which they say often makes ghosts restless , then tell us about it .
Come on , let's go at it , Macduff , and damn the first man who cries , 'Stop !
I'll scalp you .
What , he never made you laugh ?
I will go find him .
If he looks serious , he must need money .
Where's Antony ?
Travelers have never told lies , no matter what the fools at home accuse them of .
Hang on a minute , who are you ?
Eros , my young friend , your captain is now just like that cloud .
Anyway , go tell your master I am here .
It's a miracle you're alive .
Yours are slow and awkward .
I took their stings too , wouldn't you say ?
We're off , Biondello .
Please , leave it here .
Remove your armor , Eros .
We
Of course .
Now there can only be the promise .
Oh God of battles , bolster my soldiers ' courage .
Let this evil hour be marked forever in the calendar as cursed .
We are free from his tyranny .
I love to argue with him when he's having one of these fits , because then he always has a lot to say .
Drink up .
The noise they're making will wake up Demetrius .
And to you , good sir .
You know that we parted only seven years ago , in Syracuse .
Thank you , sir .
So tell me what's been going on .
He stayed like that a long time .
That's noble of you , master .
Here comes Antony .
I'm tired and feeling heavy , but I can't sleep .
you will And what if he won't stop ?
All right , stop this .
I'm going .
Oh , noble weakness !
You've heard something you shouldn't have .
Then she was even more an angel , and you're an even blacker devil !
Signor Bassanio !
Please go find out for certain who has arrived .
But tell me , how is your cousin ?
If he's as good as a saint but is black like a devil , I'd rather he hear my confession than marry me .
Let's not fight over this fellow .
Go away , now .
I swam ashore like a duck .
How the hell does he know our language ?
Were you listening to these verses ?
I'll scratch out your eyes , even if they could fly .
Take in the wheeled canons with their deadly gaping mouths trained on the walled city of Harfleur .
Get out of that position , because I can disarm you with my magic wand and make your sword drop .
Calphurnia !
My dear Regan , your sister's not worth anything .
Yes , Petruchio .
While I was looking for a flint to light it , I found this paper on the window , sealed up like this , and I'm sure it wasn't there when I went to bed .
That's it .
But you should hurry anyway .
Enough !
Tell me that you'll accept my love .
What havoc have you wreaked in this part of the forest ?
What do you say , Caesar ?
Then heaven have mercy on me !
I hear his trumpet .
Get yourself to a church and have a proper priest , who can tell you what marriage is all about , marry you .
Did it stay a long time ?
Boatswain !
All right , then .
My lord , you don't need to apologize .
Can you imagine cement and stone talking better ?
My master's calling me .
There will be no lecture .
I want to speak with Clarence , and I came here on my legs .
He is , my lord .
Oh , she tears that letter into a thousand small pieces and berates herself for being so forward as to write a letter to a man she knows would mock her .
You can't blame anyone for it anyone , I say .
It's the wind .
I've sworn I'll never sleep with him or talk to him again .
Your husband's mad , isn't he ?
I'll wait till his beard grows in , if you'll just hurry up and tell me what chin that beard is on .
Father , take pity on him .
There , take it , and thanks for taking such good care of me .
We rejoice to see you , most worthy brother of England .
Fever , as we know , is a kind of madness .
Then Antony offered it the third time .
A man who achieves more in war than his captain does becomes his captain's rival .
The carriages , sir , are the hangers , where the swords hang .
A lioness gave birth in the streets , and graves cracked open and thrust out their dead .
Quiet !
My liege .
Yes , my lord .
He's a lord to a lord and a man to a man .
Hey !
He was like that time of year halfway between the extremes of hot and cold : he was neither sad nor happy .
Look behind you , my lord .
Is there more work to do ?
I'm going now .
Asses are made for bearing , and so are you .
What a fool I've been !
You aren't wood , you aren't stones , you're men .
Why are you so pale ?
You think I'm a sponge , my lord ?
Come , last of my friends , rest on this rock .
We have kissed away entire kingdoms and provinces .
Oh bloody Richard !
Get away from me , witch ! " the fat woman cried .
Who's there ?
Where is that damned wretch , Tranio , who defied me in such a disgraceful manner ?
Yes , Lepidus .
If I don't answer , perhaps you'll think I'm accepting the heavy responsibility you foolishly want to impose on me .
Welcome , my good friends .
Sounds good to us .
What do you want with me ?
Draw your trustworthy sword , which you have used in such service to your country .
No , uncle , I won't be married .
Bring your master home .
Please , my king , be quiet .
Have you forgotten the horrid witch Sycorax , stooped over with old age and ill will ?
Here , at your service .
He can't give his house away to his daughters , leaving himself without shelter .
I will confess it to all the world .
He's been gone for nine years and he's leaving again soon .
The court has sent for us .
Oh , Cassio , where did you get this ?
When did she send you ?
Give him the goblet .
On a night like this a campfire in an empty field would be like the heart of a dirty old man , a tiny spark in a cold body .
What didn't you like ?
I'll prove with my sword that I'm not scared of you .
And how he loves Caesar !
It used to be the last ditch comfort of miserable people .
Why , what did he do ?
But wait a minute , please .
Or am I asleep now and imagining all this ?
They have wings .
Octavia has a pious , chaste , meek disposition .
Yes , my lord .
Therefore , in case he does , we must hold him back .
Casca will tell us what's the matter .
Come out , I order you .
I can't do this .
Tell her .
I recently shared a bed with Cassio , and I couldn't sleep because of a raging toothache .
Indeed , they say my uncle grew so fast that he could gnaw on a crust of bread when he was two hours old .
Take my sword .
Come with me .
She creeps along .
Do it well , and then leave us .
I swear , I don't like the look of you .
Phoebe , keep your promise to marry me , and to marry this shepherd if you choose to refuse me .
Oh , but there's one more thing to tell you .
Listening to their frightened voices , I couldn't reply "Amen" when they said "God bless us ! " Don't think about it so much .
I'm starting to lose my mind .
Well , it's not for me to say .
His beard was gray , right ?
We need a more appropriate place to discuss Cordelia and her father .
What did they do wrong ?
No , our general's infatuation is out of control .
So how did it go , sir ?
I'll bet we're both thinking the same thing , master .
But honestly , I should have been a woman .
Yes , my lord ?
Rise , princes , and , with a spirit of honor more sharply edged than your swords , rush to the battlefield : Charles Delabreth , High Constable of France ; you dukes of Orleans , Bourbon , Berri , Alencon , Brabant , Bar , and Burgundy ; Jaques Chatillon , Rambures , Vaudemont , Beaumont , Grandpre , Roussi , and Fauconberg , Foix , Lestrale , Bouciqualt , and Charolois .
What do you want ?
My father can't think straight , a hundred knights !
Here comes Kent .
Ha !
The devil himself couldn't say a name I hate more .
I've been tricked .
The prince of Arragon has taken his oath , and he's coming to make his choice now .
The tunnels !
Come here , ma'am .
I'll marry the earl of Warwick's youngest daughter , Lady Anne .
Sir , this is the truth : you and the rest , all the people who have ever talked about her , have all been wrong .
He should go up and offer his petition to Caesar now .
I can't pull a cart or eat dried oats like a horse .
Goodbye .
Don't be silly !
But I'm not dying yet !
You're not being a good friend , Iago , if you even Please don't ask me to tell you .
True .
Where is the number of our English dead ?
I have a list of all the important men .
Never !
Oh , Ophelia , I'm bad at poetry .
She gave up her life with your name still within her .
I'm finished , then .
Here , Peter Quince .
Brother , I'm giving you good advice .
They'll be married tomorrow , and I'll invite the duke to the ceremony .
It may be honest , but it's never wise to bring bad news .
I don't expect Caesar and Antony will have a very friendly reunion .
Don't provoke them to battle until we have finished at sea .
What do you mean by that ?
You mean an officer ?
But a stronger pity , for the wrongs committed against Rome , drove out our pity for Caesar , as fire drives out fire , and so we killed him .
It's strange that you haven't heard .
There's no crab-apple here , so don't look sour .
You have guessed exactly what I feared .
What are you doing here alone ?
If you really are Sir Rowland's son , as you've just whispered to me , and I can absolutely see the likeness in your face , you are truly welcome here .
So let's join forces and get revenge .
It does have a back like a weasel's .
Go ahead , then .
Not a word .
No wonder she's waiting to get married .
Don't bother trying to intimidate me by putting your hand on your sword .
Read it .
I was engaged to her before I ever met Hermia .
But if you steal my reputation , you're robbing me of something that doesn't make you richer , but makes me much poorer .
No , Lysander .
It's a nice hand , an open one .
In the fact that it's solitary , I enjoy it very much ; but in the sense that it's private , it's terrible .
It's not safe to be straightforward and honest .
No , not too upset .
You'll get there two days before me .
Our friendship in our schooldays , our childhood innocence ?
Let's go .
So we need another prologue to tell everyone he's not a real lion .
Get out , you horrible poison .
But that is a false conclusion , since we have locks to keep our valuables safe and clever traps to catch little thieves .
You're so much older than you look !
Only for poor men ?
The Prince and Claudio are supposed to be here by now. , You know your job , brother .
Calphurnia's face is pale , and Cicero's eyes are as red and fiery as they get when senators are arguing with him at the Capitol .
I'll show you where to get fresh water .
Why couldn't you be attended by my servants , or by Regan's ?
Farewell .
Sir Walter Herbert , a renowned soldier ; Sir Gilbert Talbot ; Sir William Stanley ; Oxford ; the highly feared Pembroke ; Sir James Blunt ; Rice ap Thomas , with a valiant crew ; and many other famous and powerful noblemen .
He is worth no more than that .
Let's stay and watch a while .
At the bottom , any change is for the better .
Hello !
So I welcome this wind freely .
Oh , but these are our friends .
Did you hear this , Gonzalo ?
Excellent , very good .
My story does raise that question .
You have a noble wife who is much more beautiful than any other woman in this declining age .
Here was a Caesar !
You haven't said anything against the Duke of Cornwall , have you ?
He was more faithful to me than the sun is to the daytime .
If it isn't my old friend Grumio , and my dear friend Petruchio !
I can confirm that all these shocking things are true .
Therefore , every soldier should do as any man who is sick in his bed would do : clear his conscience of any stain .
Huh !
But they are dead , and you killed them , you slave of the devil .
I hope I see him and hear him again soon .
She's as dead as the cold ground .
Why are you yelling at me so angrily ?
This bigmouth jerk here , ( He'll still die by hanging , not drowning , even if every drop of water in the sea tries to swallow him .
That's true , my lord .
My father , led by a poor peasant ?
Oh , I see , you will only part with lightweight presents .
Oh , will you leave me alone in the dark ?
I have no doubt that you love me .
More , more , please , more .
Your name is Lucentio , you say .
Oh , heavenly mixture !
Indeed I did , my lord .
Let's be sacrificers but not butchers , Caius .
I hope you get what you desire !
Remorseless , treacherous , sex-obsessed , unnatural villain !
Have faith , love me , and you will get better .
It just appeared before them and marched past them with slow dignity three times , a staff's distance from their amazed eyes , while they turned , quaking with fear and too shocked to speak .
What's the matter ?
Good morning , Catesby .
They probably put him up to killing old man Gloucester to get his money .
I didn't say free , madam .
If I may say so , your Majesty , your famous grandfather and your great-uncle Edward , the Black Prince of Wales , or so I've read in the history books , fought a very brave battle here in France .
What news do you bring ?
Scum !
He looks angry .
Honest , yes , honest .
Unpunished !
If we meet Macbeth's army tonight , let us be beaten if we can not fight .
He's here , sir , but please don't bother him .
What is the name of the castle that stands over there ?
Let's proceed .
And I know that by now they're waiting for me on the porch outside Pompey's theater .
Then , gentlemen , we can count on trouble .
I think he's actually serious , and not just being polite .
I know the glove is a glove .
And Madam , with all my heart .
And has my armor been put in my tent ?
But now , I tell you , keep it to yourself , though , those enemies of mine are being put to death today , and I'm better than I've ever been .
Isn't today the day when Hermia has to tell us her decision about whether she'll marry Demetrius ?
When I tell him he hates flatterers , he agrees , just at the moment when I'm flattering him the most .
I've separated them into groups around the island , just as you ordered .
He is fortifying his castle at Dunsinane with heavy defenses .
May God give their souls rest .
We don't want you to think we came here to offend you , except that we want to offend you with our good intentions .
Or walk either .
That's him .
Someone whose mood is as foul as the weather , very troubled .
Run , my lord , run .
Judge for yourself .
If it pleases your Majesty , let his neck pay the price , if there is any martial law in the world .
What's Pyramus ?
Stay away for now , and good night , my sweet friend .
Look , if you really love the beautiful Hero , enjoy it .
I've rented land from you and your father for eighty years .
Follow my mother .
Such an expression of despair would only prove that I was guilty .
Iago , give these letters to the ship's captain who brought me here , and ask him to pay my respects to the Senate of Venice .
Everyone knows that when you pour a drink out of a cup and into a glass , the cup becomes empty .
Where's the Queen ?
Be quiet and listen to me .
Just listen carefully while I tell you the amazing thing I saw , with these gentlemen as witnesses .
Ding , dong , bell .
Do you really speak like such a gentleman ?
Since Macbeth went to war , I have seen her rise from her bed , put on her nightgown , unlock her closet , take out some paper , fold it , write on it , read it , seal it up , and then return to bed , remaining asleep the entire time .
The lack of time and the risk I'm under will have to keep us from bonding and catching up on each other's news the way we usually would after not seeing each other for so long .
I'd rather be a dog and howl at the moon than be that kind of Roman .
How late is it , lords ?
This is not the time for dwelling on personal grievances .
O Harry's wife , do not triumph in my sorrow !
Look around you , Caesar .
Come on , let's go see the king .
So , take me , death !
They haven't been commanded to go to the west , mighty king .
Come on , let's go inside .
Yes , yes .
Why ?
The bitter one is the other one , that's you.LEAR Are you calling me a fool , boy ?
Since I was three years old , I've been in contact with a powerful but virtuous magician , no black magic here .
The mayor is here at hand .
Sometimes you get a bit too wild , and you let your voice get a bit loud and rude .
Quiet , quiet !
No .
Let me see your eyes .
Hero is his only child , and his only heir .
Good morning , Prince ; good morning , Claudio .
He's a stylish man .
You're not one of Pinch's patients , are you , sir ?
Be quiet , you are Antonio .
Will you listen to me , Roderigo ?
She has been in a man's bed .
On a night like this , pretty Jessica , in a bad mood , said outrageously wrong things about her lover , and he forgave her .
You should know that when I came here I was prepared to accept your offer .
But if you had to say something nice about me , what would you say ?
I hope your love for me remains this strong for your entire life !
Gold , silver , and common lead .
Whatever your highness commands me to do , it is always my duty to do it .
Are you out of your mind and deaf too ?
He'll make your palace tremble for this insult , even if it were the mightiest in all of Europe .
I think so .
The muffled queen" is good .
Oh , no , he's surely not in hell .
Now , noble Buckingham , seal this alliance by embracing my wife's friends , and make me happy in your unity .
Any news from Genoa ?
This wicked man will be brought face to face with Margaret , who I believe was hired by Don John to take part in this plot .
Forty thousand brothers , if you added all their love together , couldn't match mine .
Thanks , my good countryman .
So I'd like it copied .
There she is , over there .
The sweetest nut has the sourest rind And Rosalind is that kind of nut .
Just listen to him .
Oh , sir , someone would think I was a good fake .
It's his wife , Lady Grey , who got him to do this .
Oh , that's ominous !
Here , you there , Grumio .
So I can eat lunch .
When I have praised Antony , I've disparaged Caesar .
By Jesus , he will defend his position on the practices of the ancient Roman wars as well as any military man in the world .
Give my regards to Hastings , Catesby .
Poor Tom will take you there .
There are more than enough willing women around .
Tennis balls , my liege .
And when you do , Cassius , calm down .
I won't until I'm ready .
Let's say goodbye to him .
Three thousand ducats for three months , and Antonio will guarantee it .
Making your loss greater makes the person who caused it worse .
When I strike , I'll cry , "All or nothing ! " Well put .
Isn't that true ?
If you'd known how much that ring meant , how much the woman who gave it to you is worth , or how much your honor depended on your keeping the ring , you wouldn't have let it go .
And it's too bad , Brutus , that you don't have any mirrors that could display your hidden excellence to yourself .
Quiet !
You knew my father well ; therefore , you know me , the sole heir to all his property and possessions , which I have added to rather than depleted .
Their story is bizarre and astounding , but it's solid and consistent .
Come on , bring them in .
Let's move .
And although we're giving these honors to this man so that he shares some of the blame for what we're doing , he'll carry these honors like a jackass carries gold , groaning and sweating under the load , either led or pushed , as we direct him .
That's how I always do it , getting money from fools .
It is well done , and appropriate for a princess who has descended from so many royal kings .
Let them go .
If he said that , then I hope his malicious soul rots in hell forever .
Go ahead , rage till your proud heart breaks .
His youngest daughter , the beautiful Bianca , is the jewel of my life , and he keeps her hidden away from me and other rivals for her hand .
Tonight is for celebrating !
Your features , God help us !
You lie , you nasty , ungrateful thing !
So they think it's a good idea for you to watch a play and direct your thoughts toward laughter and merriment , two strong preventive medicines that foster long life .
Let's have explicit contracts drawn up to ensure that both sides keep their promises .
Where's Peaseblossom ?
I feel awful for my cousin .
Start the fire , good Curtis .
As you were on land .
Who is leading his men ?
And were you then happy to find shelter on a bed of hay along with swine and homeless bums ?
Go to your tomb !
I'll speak as sharp as a dagger to her , but I won't use one on her .
Is it true , is it true ?
Richard loves neither me nor any of you .
Please , who ?
These ones , then , will be assassinated .
I'm not coming .
You thought you were being funny , but you said the truth .
One of you go find the forest ranger .
Fierce , fiery warriors fought in the clouds in the usual formations of war , ranks and squadrons , until the clouds drizzled blood onto the Capitol .
Is that the latest we can do it ?
Don't worry about me. , Your sister and the duke are here .
It's partly my own fault , since I followed you here .
I would gladly do without that if he would only stay faithful to me .
Thank you .
Amen to that !
I know when a man is on fire , he'll swear anything .
You must go to Parthia .
I'll tell him right away , my lord .
Well , I think it's good to be serious and keep quiet .
You're too forgiving .
where we quietly buried you , has opened up its heavy marble jaws to spit you out again .
Ha !
Bad news , my lord .
In emergencies you meet the strangest folks .
If you can leave your body so easily , then the touch of death is like a lover's pinch , which hurts but is desired .
In that case , I ask that for the sake of friendship and alliance you let that one item stand with the rest , and bestow your daughter on me .
I know him well by reputation .
He called her a whore so many times , and heaped up so much abuse on her that good people can't stand to hear it .
Here , sir !
Lend me your handkerchief .
You speak more wisely than you know .
These lords seem so astonished that they've lost their use of reason and can hardly believe what they see with their own eyes. , But whatever the reason for your losing your senses , you can know for sure that I'm Prospero , that same duke who was kicked out of Milan and landed on this same island where you landed , and became the lord of it .
Give me a kiss .
You defend yourself by blaming my judgment , but you're just making up feeble excuses .
Come inside with me , and I will tell you my plan .
So they are possibly Antony's friends .
With one little toss of his head , He can scare you off for good .
You may be exaggerating the risks .
We'll answer .
Certainly , I did .
Sister , you know he promised to give me a necklace .
Lord Gloucester has helped him leave .
John Duke of Norfolk and Thomas Earl of Surrey will lead the horsemen and foot soldiers .
I'll get your goats , Audrey .
Our army shall somberly attend this funeral and then depart for Rome .
Do you have the lion's part written down ?
Go away , get out of here , and stop following me .
I can not blame you now for weeping .
I've almost forgotten what fear feels like .
I don't have to give you answers that you like .
Now that you speak of paper , I remember a funny story of Hero's .
What's this ?
Me neither .
Dear lady , welcome home .
I don't think you would .
My situation is desperate .
Take me by the hand and say , "Harry of England , I am yours." No sooner shall I hear that word than I will tell you straight out , "England is yours , Ireland is yours , France is yours , and Harry Plantagenet
Lieutenant Cassio will be on guard duty tonight .
Amen to that , Gonzalo .
Worse than that , she's polluted herself , so that the fountain is a place where disgusting toads copulate and reproduce !
Who else should it be ?
Excuse me ?
Are you so pious that you would pray for this man and his children , a man who has pushed you toward an early grave and put your family in poverty forever ?
Angelo , the jeweler .
If she orders me to go , I'll thank her warmly as if she'd just offered to put me up for a week .
I've got no food to give you .
It's true , and he asked me to beg you both to attend .
Since you are a lying hypocrite , we must look after you .
Do you know the difference , my boy , between a bitter fool and a sweet one ?
But if you would be willing to accept circumstantial evidence as proof , we can get that .
No , not a bit .
She's wise , if I'm judging her right .
Speak .
Why not ?
Could you tell me how near the enemy is ?
And , in fact , I think they're meeting together right now .
Welcome back to Denmark , my lord .
Will no one back me up ?
Where are you going ?
This is getting worse and worse !
Your Brutus ordered me to give it to you , and I'll do what he says .
What traitor hears me and doesn't say amen ?
What is the matter here ?
I'll do everything a younger man could do for you .
Since you left , I've been enjoying the sweetest sleep and most promising dreams I've ever had , my lords .
Let me hear what Agrippa has to say .
This is a good agreement .
Are you ashamed of me ?
Will you play this recorder ?
Here's where they'll end up , on the floor .
What has Caesar done to deserve your love ?
Bring his will here , and we'll figure out a way to reduce his bequests to the people .
You were one of his favorites .
Come on , you're fooling yourself .
On record , my gracious lord .
Is it possible for a mutt to lend three thousand ducats ? " Or should I bend down low , and in a humble and submissive voice say :
The king , sir , has bet that in a dozen rounds between you and Laertes , he won't beat you by more than three hits .
Is that possible ?
Wasn't he born from a woman ?
Neighbors , hello .
God help you , foolish man .
I wonder that none of you thought about getting his support .
I've been practicing fencing constantly since he went off to France .
I want the law , the penalty , and the fulfillment of my contract .
You're both wrong .
If you're going to die , be quick about it so you can catch the king's departing soul or follow him , like obedient subjects , to his new kingdom of endless night .
We have to strike while the iron's hot .
If she rants , I'll tell her that she sings as sweetly as a nightingale .
Listen to my excuse .
We are , my lord .
I wish I could believe you that all was well !
My wife and I ordered him to hang Cordelia in prison and then to make it look as if she committed suicide in despair .
The king ?
That's great .
Whatever happens tonight , don't talk about it .
They will steal anything and call it spoils .
I'm wide awake .
Just go after him and watch what he does next .
A bit of a hurry , my lord !
With the help of the grim The first to greet me there was my great
I took good care of you , piece of filth that you are , and let you stay in my own hut until you tried to rape my daughter .
I'm serious , I can't .
Struggling with the wind and rain .
Time , you thwart my dreadful plans .
I was about to swear that I loved you .
He will show me the part of heaven where the bachelors sit , and I'll have fun there forever .
This is a miracle , if you talk of miracles .
I assure you he can .
Good night , honest Iago .
We're glad to see you .
Please make him change his mind .
You can have what you want .
Oh , don't worry about it , we'll dip your I'll get you for that one .
And here's Regan , whose grotesque face betrays her twisted heart .
I've been poisoned .
I do think Scotland is sinking under Macbeth's oppression .
He can't go in there because of the candle .
I'm a prince by birth , Miranda , maybe even a king now ; though I wish I weren't , and normally I wouldn't put up with carrying these logs any more than I'd let flies breed in my mouth .
Oh Stephano , do you have any more of that wine ?
What do you want from me , my good man ?
You may , Mark Antony .
Ah , I've got it !
What a man ! , especially compared to my husband .
Oh , don't ask me why I "need" them !
That pretty boy , Claudio ?
If I cut my finger , I'll use you as a bandage to stop the bleeding. , And your name , sir ?
Do you hear that , men ?
You're lying , you shaggy-haired villain !
The laws of Venice state that if a foreign resident directly or indirectly attempts to kill any citizen , the person he tried to kill will receive one half of the foreigner's goods .
Then he pulled a watch from his bag and , looking at it solemnly , said , "It's ten o'clock .
Return to the gracious duke , good Catesby .
Oh , oh , oh !
Hello , mortal !
You won't lose any respect .
Please , educate me .
Isn't he the one who's always , " and so on .
Madam !
When was the last time you saw her sleepwalking ?
No , with Demetrius .
You would run away from a bear , but if the only way to run was into the stormy ocean , you'd turn around and confront the bear .
What's the news , my good friends ?
That's how it will be for some other men , too , who think they're as safe as you and I , who are well-loved by noble Richard and Buckingham .
Goodbye to the soldiers and to the wars that make men great !
Caesar and Antony have always achieved more by delegating authority to their officers than by leading their troops in person .
Bassanio , let him have the ring .
Yes , it's definitely nippy .
No , my dear cousin .
Yes .
You agreed to send me troops and weapons when I needed them .
If there's anyone in this assembly , any dear friend of Caesar's , I say to him that my love for Caesar was no less than his .
I have to pretend to threaten you with my sword .
If the Turkish fleet isn't protected in some harbor , their men must all be drowned .
I hope to God we can make him happy and do him some good !
It's nice of you to remind me .
We're ready for both , my lord .
It wouldn't let my soul find its way to air but smothered it inside my gasping body .
I didn't say anything .
I will , my lord .
Good sir ,
It looks like you've offended it .
But who would dare tell her ?
No , by Our Lady , I'm not such a fool to think what I please , and I don't please to think what I can , and in fact I can not think , even if I could think my heart right past thinking , that you are in love or that you will be in love or even that you can be in love .
You fell from the terrifying top of this chalk cliff .
Don't be late .
No one's listening to you .
But I could see that Cupid's fiery arrow was put out by watery , virginal moonbeams , so the royal virgin continued her virginal thoughts without being interrupted by thoughts of love .
But you can't blame me for her offenses .
I knew from the first it would be this way .
Listen to me , Queen .
Other countries criticize us for our loud partying .
Welcome to the open air again .
I've told you what I intend to do , and I've sworn by the holy Sabbath to seek the penalty that is due according to our contract .
Answer me that first .
There's no scarier wild bird than the living lion , and we should remember that .
I know him well .
I will perform this ceremony every year .
I'll read it. , It looks so unlike Portia !
Is he standing or sitting ?
Show it !
You told me to do the same , my liege .
Yes , but that makes me love you even more .
I wish my daughter were dead at my feet wearing those jewels !
No , sit down .
You're supposed to show that you understand that Pyramus just went to check on a noise he heard and is coming right back .
When I send for you , come out wearing masks .
Go as fast as you can .
I don't know what to say .
For three months , hmmm .
But let's follow it , and then do our dirty work afterward .
I'm telling you the truth .
Why , that's my dainty Ariel singing now .
You're right .
Let's see here .
I'm going to ask her to let me talk to Desdemona .
The honest men .
Put on a happy face , and welcome your friends .
He was on his way here with your wife .
Labio and Flavio , push our armies onward .
Oh Portia , these are some of the worst words that ever stained a piece of paper .
Take him off to jail !
The two of us together will sing like birds in a cage .
Oh , my lady , I'm ashamed to admit it .
We must tie them up and leave them in some dark room .
It's a common What ?
I'll meet you at the ferry .
So , tell me , assuming I win your daughter's love , what dowry would she bring to the marriage ?
Poor Antony !
Then I have offended no one .
What was I saying ?
So go on , tell me the news .
I just saw your father the Lord Gloucester and notified him that the Duke of Cornwall and his wife Regan will stay with him here tonight .
The Dauphin , whom we asked for reinforcements , sends back the answer that he's not yet in a position to raise so great an army .
I can't talk now .
It was not Caesar's bravery that conquered Antony but Antony's that has triumphed over himself .
It's too bad I'm so hard-hearted , because I really don't love anyone .
Good morning , brother Bedford .
It's not good for your health , either .
You told me that you don't salute at the court but kiss hands .
My sword and I will earn our place in history .
Why , Dromio ?
But Roderigo , if you're as courageous and determined as I think you are , then wait just a bit longer .
Tell me where you learned these strange things , and why you stop us at this desolate place with this prophetic greeting ?
With the permission of Brutus and the others , for Brutus is an honorable man ; they are all honorable men , I have come here to speak at Caesar's funeral .
I fear that your words and your heart are both false .
Don't run away , stay where you are .
Here .
What mistress do you have ?
Just you wait .
The crown was offered to him three times ?
Please wear this ring .
I'd feel sorry for them , if I were human .
No , I swear on my honor , I haven't , madam .
Come , trusty sword .
Bring me a bigger one .
I am ashamed that women are so foolish as to declare war when they should plead on their knees for peace , that they seek authority , supremacy , and power when they are under an obligation to serve , love , and obey .
Then where would you have me go , Adam ?
You have the nerve to call me daughter ?
If you're Trinculo , then come out .
The hour of death is approaching .
That's why I'm worried about you .
Strato , you've slept this whole time .
What are your names ?
Let's take a little walk in the orchard before dinner .
Go , then , mother , to your daughter .
Just remember that he is Caesar .
Hortensio
I wish it were over .
I swear to God , if I hadn't seen this with my own eyes I'd never believe it .
Then I salute you with this royal title : long live Richard , England's worthy king !
Why shouldn't I be there in person ?
Did God make him ?
So were you .
I'm sorry to hear this .
How many people are cowards at heart but wear beards like Hercules or Mars , the god of war ?
She I can guess her answer .
Tell me that I'll marry three kings before noon and be widowed by all of them .
There's no way to read a man's mind by looking at his face .
Come on .
What does your grace want ?
Would I dare do something like that ?
Let me go , I say .
Oh , my reputation , Iago , my reputation !
Young girls call it "love-in-idleness." Bring me that flower .
Beware Macduff .
I'm leaving now .
I have no choice .
And after that he came back here looking so serious ?
Thanks for your company but , really , I would have preferred being alone .
I'll go hunting again tomorrow , I think .
Come here , Leonato .
The Hero that died !
Have you heard of me , most noble Empress ?
Another thing , Domitius : Antony wants to see you now .
No , and I didn't hear anything either , or suspect anything at all .
Her sighs and tears are like great winds and floods .
Please do , madam .
I'll do it .
What mercy can you show him , Antonio ?
The will !
Read it , great Caesar .
I have .
He has called for his horse , but I don't know where he's headed .
Thank you for his present and your trouble .
I can't believe you're my son .
The morning is approaching .
She seemed to be trying to control her emotions , which were overwhelming her .
Follow me , madam. , Throw the blind traitor outside .
Send a message to his brother .
We'll outwit them all , that old geezer , Gremio ; the suspicious father , Minola ; the prim musician lover , Litio , all for the sake of my master , Lucentio .
Are you sick ?
This is exactly how she always looks , and , I swear it , she is fast asleep .
I'm not who I appear to be .
There never was a monarch better feared and loved than yourself , your Majesty .
The princes are under some strange misunderstanding .
Oh , is that so ?
I'll make her come right away , I promise you .
Oh , you prophesied that the time would come when I would want your help in cursing that humpbacked spider , that hideous toad !
But I beg your pardon .
Didn't you hear someone shouting ?
I know you from before .
Can you imagine being hitched to a lump of clay ?
For God's sake , let me hear it .
This is the final discussion I will grant .
I know the real reason .
You know what , my lord ?
I'll spend tonight working to make something horrible happen .
Bring me an exact report of the number of dead on both sides .
My plans are almost at their climax .
Be happy .
Babbling senselessly ?
Listen , Guildenstern , and you too , Rosencrantz , listen as close as you can !
I could go on weeping like a woman and bragging about how I will avenge them !
All right , Friar Francis , let's keep this short .
I don't like it .
He said she was unfaithful ?
Yes , he was hotheaded even in the prime of his life .
Good night to you both .
He liked to call me a loan shark ; let him think about his debt to me .
Well , that's just greedy .
He's married to Octavia .
Then love me , Rosalind .
We are all made of dreams , and our life stretches from sleep before birth to sleep after death .
Oh cowardly conscience , how you're torturing me !
You could only imitate his imperfections so well if you were the man himself .
Give me the daggers .
For the sake of our old friendship , I ask you , hold my sword handle while I run on it .
You will not blame us in your funeral speech , but will say all the good you want to about Caesar and that you do it by our permission .
My lord ?
Or are you low , vulgar , and of the common people ?
Please , sir , don't trouble yourself .
Until you get back , Nerissa and I will live like virgins and widows .
Upon the king !
The moon ?
And when I've sneaked up on my sons-in-law , then I'll kill , kill , kill , kill , kill , kill !
Be eloquent on my behalf .
No , if you can't adjust to political changes , you'll suffer for it .
It doesn't look that way to me .
Be thrifty .
See , ladies , how they scorn me now .
An enemy to tyrants and a friend to my country .
If your gentle souls are still flying in the air and have not yet landed where they will remain forever , hover around me with your airy wings and hear your mother's lament .
justice will be rewarded .
The tyrant I'm serving now can go to hell !
We're going to have an out-and-out brawl if I stay any longer .
What , you're not a whore ?
My niece , you are welcome here as if you were my own daughter .
He loves them both .
I'm indebted to you forever .
He's the only worthy man in Italy , aside from my dear Claudio .
Come , then , and send his body to Thasos .
She stood and spoke .
And now you toss flowers in the path of Caesar , who comes in triumph over Pompey's defeated sons ?
The marshal of France , Monsieur la Far .
You've wronged Caius Ligarius .
Show them in .
Don't argue against it .
Most mighty Caesar , give me some reason , so I won't be laughed at when I tell them so .
Henry the Sixth , crowned king of France and England while still in his infancy , succeeded him .
She is banished .
I just meant that our hearts are joined , so we can almost think of them as one heart .
I made you de facto rulers of my kingdom on condition that I could keep a hundred knights of my own .
Please , sir , hurry up .
What do you think about it ?
And that's what you want me to do !
I want to drink your health .
Watch him closely .
Pray you sit still .
Don't delay .
He's evaded love once or twice , and since then Cupid doesn't dare to shoot at him .
Or , rather , I'll kill you , or I'll do away with you , or I'll turn your life into death and your freedom into captivity .
murder !
And , being men , the contents of Caesar's will would enrage you .
Where is that moron of a cook ?
Hurry , you slave !
Amen .
What's my name ?
And make sure to carry a prayer book in your hand and to stand between two priests , okay ?
Your servant Kent .
Oh !
The wide ocean doesn't prevent them from coming to see her , they travel across it as if it were a little stream .
Hello , everyone !
Fake , I'm telling you .
I wish she were in her coffin here , with the ducats in her coffin !
All I'm saying is that strange things have been going on .
From now on , goodness in women , not superficial beauty , will win my heart .
I'm not afraid of dead uncles .
That's true , that's very true .
We'll be ready when the time comes .
But despite all this , your daughters will give you a lot of money , or do I mean pain ? , in the coming year .
Don't talk about Helena .
Check and see if he's breathing .
I wish none of this had happened , given the situation here , and your rank .
Didn't great Caesar bleed for the sake of justice ?
Tyrrel , I mean those bastards in the Tower .
We failed in half of our mission .
We did a lot of drinking in Egypt .
I've already sent the proof in my letters .
I have a bad cold that's bothering me .
You knew that my spirit was completely under your control and that I would ignore the gods' orders in favor of yours .
The last thing he did before sending me off , dear Queen , was to kiss , the last of many such kisses , this Indian pearl for you .
Dressing my out-and-out wickedness in scraps of Scripture , I look like a saint exactly when I'm most like the devil .
The drink , the drink !
Let's sit here and let the music fill our ears .
Not the one I gave you , I hope .
I think it is , sir .
Because of your advice and your help , I have a high position now .
Cicero is dead , by their decree .
Those are only two of his weapons .
Oh , Caesar !
I've already slept , my lord .
My money's almost run out .
It orders me to hand the noble duke of Clarence over to you .
If you thought that you'd be thinking too much .
Come with me ; I'll spy under the tents to see if any of my own people plan to desert me .
When she is like this , besides walking and performing various activities , have you heard her say anything ?
I don't know .
Curse you for your false appearances !
I can't live by pretending anymore .
The most beautiful queen they ever had .
It has caused the downfall of many kings .
Come , sir , no more. , Oswald , come here !
A man no mightier than you or I in ability , yet grown as huge and frightening as tonight's strange happenings .
If I can't do that , I can at least make the Moor so jealous that he can't think straight .
Now grit your teeth and let your nostrils flare .
She cursed Hastings then .
Yes , he said something in Greek .
Here's the money you asked me to hold .
Don't you recognize me , father ?
Prepare the body , then , and follow us .
Our master and mistress are looking for you .
Yes , for three months .
They're playing with me .
Damn it !
They're all welcome .
All right Ursula , as Beatrice arrives , we'll be walking up and down this alley and speaking about nothing but Benedick .
Oh , this is cause for an extraordinary joy that should be engraved in gold on pillars to last forever .
Let's go .
But will my Rosalind do this , too ?
Go on !
Let George Stanley die after the battle .
It'll be worth your while .
Yes .
He says she has no equal .
I don't think there's a man under the sun who's worse at hiding his love or hate than Richard .
Here's my key .
I won't give up this child for all of Fairyland .
I will go out .
Signor Lodovico ?
I know her by her walk .
I don't understand all dat .
Sadly , it's the king that's missing .
The graceful and renowned king is dead .
Who here is so low that he wants to be a slave ?
Oh , come on , woman .
What we are is up to us .
Well , if you have to go , you have to go .
Othello isn't any of those things .
Can you feel your legs ?
Everyone can see that , and even blind men can smell the stench of his misery now .
Our land forces have bravely stood firm .
In private ?
I'm strong-willed .
This guy here has banished two of his daughters and blessed the third one without intending to .
Never , Iago .
All is lost !
No one .
How ?
Now , now , both of you gentlemen !
But I'm still afraid .
No !
I never heard so loud a voice issue from such an empty heart .
No , you'd answer , "The slaves are ours." And that's just how I'm answering you .
Ah , but I know you .
Let's speak to him .
Made it for me ?
For it is written in the book of Numbers : "When the man dies , let the inheritance descend unto the daughter." Gracious lord , claim what is yours .
Oh , uncle , it's better to smile and flatter indoors where it's dry than get soaked out here .
I'll tell you , good Brutus .
Didn't I buckle this well ?
Oh , proud Death , what banquet are you preparing that you've needed to knock off so many princes at one stroke ?
You have to be patient with me .
You'd better not wear your dagger in your cap that day , or he might slap your head with it .
She's so good at sewing , and a wonderful musician .
I always loved you .
What else ?
Can't do it .
I'll get myself a fur-trimmed suit .
To race after your departing ships , leaving his navy to watch , was a shame as great as the resulting loss .
Never mind .
Do you have enough love for me to be patient when my bad temper , which I inherited from my mother , makes me forget how I should behave ?
It's easy to err when left to our own devices , but criticism helps us to see our faults and correct them .
There's no one else here .
What do you think , Bottom ?
Does he reward my dedicated service with such deep contempt ?
I'll say goodbye once more .
I give you a sister whom I love more than a brother ever loved any sister .
I know it's foolish to be so much in love , but I can't help it .
If you had , the kings that have revolted and the soldier that deserted this morning would still be behind you .
He's not standing straight enough to hold a flag .
Your grace , the person who is going to deliver the prologue is ready .
Richard is looking cheerful today .
It's not true .
So be quiet .
I say she shall. , And first begin with her .
From now on I'll put up with my anguish until the anguish itself cries out , "Enough , enough ! " and disappears .
With a hand like this you need to
No more talk about killing yourself , okay ?
Oh , my lord !
I'm no less noble than you are , Edmund .
It is , my lord .
My mind is too great for that .
I feel I should recognize you and that man
Nerissa's got the right idea .
Ah , it's a sensitive animal , with a good conscience .
Dromio ?
You scolded him in private ?
The river in Monmouth is called Wye , but the name of the other river has gone out of my head .
You're going to lose this bet , my lord .
These child actors are now in fashion , and they've so overtaken the public theaters that society types hardly come at all , they're so afraid of being mocked by the playwrights who write for the boys .
It's like half your soul's been ripped out .
May my wrinkles forbid that !
It's a very sad day .
What victory does he bring home ?
Another case : King Lewis the Tenth , who was sole heir to the usurper Capet , could not rest easy as king until he was assured that Queen Isabel , his grandmother , was a direct descendent of the Lady Ermengare , daughter of the aforementioned Charles duke of Lorraine , by which marriage the line of Charles the Great was reunited with the throne of France .
I would've been a sore king then .
No , madam .
He fell down in the marketplace and foamed at the mouth and was speechless .
Here comes the owner of one piece .
This is Decius Brutus .
God knows I have done my best to argue for you , and made him angry at me for being so aggressive .
Do you have in there the pretty snake of the Nile that kills without pain ?
How can a tailor make a person ?
What will this do ?
Will our army cut a swath through the fighting force of France , achieving and accomplishing everything I've assembled them to do ?
I will live in your heart , die in your lap , and be buried in your eyes , and , what's more , I will go with you to your uncle's .
Hurry to a convent .
Even the fiercest wild animal has some touch of pity .
I will , my lord .
Therefore , when he has reason to fear , as we do , his fears are without question of the same order .
Tom's chilly .
My stupid heart , which I'm leaving behind here .
Good night , Pompey .
I speak to you as a plain soldier .
Stanley , pay attention to your wife's doings .
What have you two sisters done ?
You can't trust anyone who abuses her own father , her flesh and blood .
But you didn't , even though you had every reason .
Ride , ride , Messala .
No , you have to call me Rosalind. , Sister , you're coming ?
Please listen to me carefully .
Now tell me how long you intend to keep her .
If your vengeful heart can't forgive me , here , take my sword and bury it in my heart so that my soul , which adores you , can be free .
And it might back up other evidence that may seem too flimsy .
Oh , please , Prince Dauphin !
While we're talking here , a royal battle could be won and lost .
But you were with him , weren't you ?
That's for sure .
No , none at all .
Welcome , welcome to all of you .
Let me go , or I'll knock you on the head .
No , that's not it , trust me .
No , he didn't get any by me .
I'm so amazed by this , I don't know what to say .
Like a young man who wants to amount to something , this morning begins early .
Oh , do not wish one more !
If you enjoy looking at your awful deeds , take a look at this noteworthy example of your butcheries .
I am nothing but a poor , used fool .
No , my lord .
No , it was just a dream .
These are tricks .
Upon my life , my lord , I'll do it .
The princes left your daughter here for dead .
You smiled with a strength you must have gotten from heaven , while I cried salty tears into the salty sea , and groaned at our situation .
Does he look as bright and handsome as the day we saw him wrestling ?
We're men beached on the sand , hoping to be washed out by the next tide .
Why not stay and hear me talk to him ?
Please be quiet .
If not , then this parting was well done .
Do you hear that , Charmian ?
Tut , tut , my lord , we're not going to stand around chit-chatting .
That doesn't matter .
What are you thinking about so seriously ?
And I won't be there either. , Edmund , I'm told you've acted like a true son to your father .
Do I speak to you kindly ?
What's this man's reputation like here in the city ?
My thanes and kinsmen , I name you all earls , the first earls that Scotland has ever had .
Yes , a little too sweet .
I will not be faced or bested .
Look how flushed the actor is , with tears in his eyes .
Clink your cups together in a toast !
Apparently so. , Cover their faces .
Were you mad when you spoke to me so madly ?
Does it really make sense , once we divide the world into three parts , that he should be one of the three rulers ?
This is the brave sergeant who fought to keep me from being captured .
But their trick failed .
Are you going to watch the race ?
He wants to be crowned .
Macduff is missing , and so is your noble son .
There is much to be learned from these converts .
I swear , , each actor arrived on his ass .
It would be a pretty stingy love if it could be counted and calculated .
To hell with you !
Wherever he goes , he inspires compassion and people turn against us .
I have walked around the streets , exposing myself to the perilous night , unbuttoned like this , as you see , Casca , baring my chest to the thunderbolt .
If only all struggles ended this well .
You have to wait for the appropriate time to let loose .
I curse myself for doing that !
You have to pretend to be your niece's father , and give her away to Claudio .
He's a king , a king !
There's something else .
This is the jester I have met so many times in the forest .
He must be very near by now .
Get down on your knees and thank heaven for sending you such a good man .
Caius Ligarius doesn't like Caesar , who berated him for speaking well of Pompey .
Why , because we're always handling our ewes , and their fleece , as you know , is greasy .
Good-bye .
What do you want ?
Hermia's not holding onto me anymore .
He's got my vote as I die .
I haven't seen such a promising candidate for your love .
The men there won't give a penny to a lame beggar , but they'll pay ten cents to look at a freak show exhibit .
You're just playing around .
You are , but you don't know it yet .
Hear everyone's opinion , but reserve your judgment .
I've had enough of this "off with you ! " Come on , let me in !
The gold I gave Dromio is safe and sound at the Centaur , and the inn host says that Dromio has left and is looking for me .
Well , good luck !
Just give me a moment , please , only a moment .
How amazing !
Hey , let's have some music here !
Titinius is lying face-up .
I promise I'll carry the wood faster .
Mark Antony , should we give the signal to attack ?
This song's about my dead father .
I'll try talking to him again .
You don't ?
I chose her for my wife when I thought I had no father to ask advice of .
The law allows it , and the court awards it .
toward his own father who loves him so completely .
But you must not attract iron , because my heart is as true as steel .
Nothing ?
You see how kind everyone is to us , how they just hand us gold .
A golden mind doesn't bend down to choose something worthless .
Beware the thane of Fife .
But if you remember , I didn't tell you to parody the style .
Tell him I want to speak with him .
If you still feel so affectionate toward her , then why not give her permission to cheat on you ?
Heaven help me , I don't know you , sir .
You don't know ?
I'll do well .
The treacherous weapon is right in your hand , sharp and dipped in poison .
But if it is a sin to be selfish about honor , I am the most guilty soul alive .
I can't imagine what's made him so unlike himself , other than his father's death .
Hello , sir .
What do you want ?
Puppet" ?
That's another bad deal I've made ! , a bankrupt , a spendthrift , who now has to hide his head on the Rialto , a beggar who used to look so smug in front of the other merchants .
Then you must take the truth I have to tell like a Roman .
Goodbye .
Who's there ?
Is that so ?
Why are we talking about him like this ?
What have you done ?
It's my daughter !
Follow him , friends .
The moon's bright tonight .
May the gods bless you .
Why are you hiding that letter ?
I'm helping Indeed , sir , find something better to do and get lost for a while .
Who are you , coming so fast in this quiet night ?
Yes , it truly is .
Cry , "whoa ! " to your tongue , please .
Please tell your brother what a convincing show I put on .
Prepare the horses for your lady .
I swear I will never break this promise of love .
Now go to the door and stay there until I call for you .
Yes , it's well built , and the ship's pilot is very expert and experienced .
Advancement to some scaffold , to lose their heads .
Now I've said it twice .
Nevertheless , it's all one , the two rivers are as alike as my fingers are to my fingers , and there are salmon in both .
Are you insane , talking like this ?
He brings me freedom .
Now , no more questions .
You can't force me any more than Hermia can beg me .
Most formidable Queen !
No , my dearest love , I wouldn't cheat you for the whole world .
You can't find that out , even if you held my heart in your hand you couldn't make me tell you .
This hasn't reached the level of an Egyptian feast yet .
Yes , but they don't see anything .
And before I make her normal again , I can cure her by treating her with another plant , I'll make her give me that little boy as my page .
Bring the fancy clothes out of my house , to use as bait to catch these thieves .
Amen to that !
The four suitors are looking for you so they can say goodbye , madam .
Double , double toil and trouble , Fire burn , and cauldron bubble .
There ! , And over there ! , And over there !
A night isn't much time for addressing matters of this importance .
My doors were locked and I was shut out , right ?
This is a guy who's been praised for his honest bluntness , and who now insolently pretends to be plainspoken and twists the natural meanings of words .
Why , good sir ?
He's honest , he's got to speak the truth .
Show her in .
I had to send it to him .
That's the one part of my service on land I do deny .
I believe drink did all of this to you last night .
I need a doctor .
You , niece .
I'm growing a beard .
We all begged you not to go ahead with those marriage plans , and your lovely daughter struggled between disgust at marrying an African and the desire to obey you .
I see a woman may be made a fool of if she doesn't have nerve enough to stand up for herself .
What , would you let a snake bite you twice ?
It's nearly dinner time , and the night's going to be wasted .
I'd never play pranks on you .
Very much so .
How's my nephew doing , noble lord of York ?
Besides , I have some business to take care of in town .
Dear father , if you caused this terrible storm with your magic powers , please put an end to it .
The adventurous knight will wave around his sword and shield , the lover will be rewarded for his sighs , the crazy character can rant all he wants , the clown will make everybody laugh , and the lady character can say whatever's on her mind , or I'll stop the play .
This is what it's all about , Please , I beg you , No , my lord , I'm comfortable like this , thank you .
Maybe she was just naked in bed with him for an hour or so , but they didn't do anything .
The wildest animal isn't as cruel as you are .
I did them for Edward's sake , and look how he rewards me. , Oh God , if my prayers don't satisfy you , and you have to avenge the wrongs I've done , at least punish me alone !
Because it will make you angry , and that will get me another beating .
Tell us , Othello .
Come on , relax , dear .
Well , then it isn't one to you , since nothing is really good or bad in itself , it's all what a person thinks about it .
Have they come back ?
In the entire play , not one word is well-written , and not one of the actors is right for his part .
Hello .
Quiet there !
Why shouldn't I ?
Don't mess with me .
Give me the goblets .
The work we enjoy is not really work .
If they'd put you in the stocks for asking that question , you would've deserved it .
What handkerchief ?
Oh , how silly we are !
I've almost missed the time he requested .
Good morning , General .
Good .
Please don't take what I said more seriously than it deserves to be taken .
Do you like me , Kate ?
And tonight , sir , I invite you have dinner with me .
It's impossible .
Back so soon ?
We'll go together , and before we've spent all the savings of your youth , we'll find a way to make a living .
I wouldn't have given it away for a whole jungle of monkeys .
Most noble Caesar !
Explain , boy .
I am sick and sullen .
I'll tell the Queen the reason for our quick departure and get her permission to leave .
The tawny cat has meowed three times .
They swore that you were nearly dead with love for me .
Look at this , here is the man , scarred , as you can see , by traitors .
It's incredible , they didn't say a word .
I wouldn't change my mind even if she were
Good night .
I'm coming .
Why should he call her a whore ?
My pretty children , both of you misunderstand me .
It fell on a little western flower , which used to be white as milk but now has turned purple from being wounded by the arrow of love .
You can't trust them .
I'm not much of a drinker .
You and your fellow spirits did your last assignment well , and now I need your help again .
Robin Starveling , you're going to play Thisbe's mother. , Tom Snout , the handyman .
He is , my lord , and safe in Leicester , where , if you'd like , we can retreat to .
Quiet !
Go .
His cowardly lips turned white , and the same eye whose gaze terrifies the world lost its gleam .
Even though Birnam Wood really did come to Dunsinane , and I'm fighting a man not of woman born , I'll fight to the end .
Then your lips will feel them more quickly .
Who among us stabbed him for any cause but justice ?
You have ruined my innocent child .
Not me .
Welcome , good Cambio .
There is a way , ma'am .
You saw eternity in my lips and eyes , and happiness in the arch of my eyebrows .
Yes , return and tell me if your master looks well , because he was sick when he left .
It's true that my brother's daughter is Queen of Tunis , and heir of Naples .
Bloodshed will force you to .
This is Cinna .
Who , me ?
be like the fountain that my children and all my descendants flow from , has rejected me !
It's weird .
You speak like a very thankful and respectful boy , and may God bless you .
Go ahead , I'll yield to your power .
Murellus and Flavius have been punished for pulling scarves off statues of Caesar .
I guess not , for good reason , as you'll soon hear .
With a needle and thread .
I once wrote a sonnet in his praise which began , "Wonder of nature , " I have heard a sonnet to one's mistress that began like that .
Yes , good idea ; that's the
If what you feel is really love , tell me how much .
Go take them back and smear the sleeping guards with the blood .
Poor Harry of England !
Peace to you , my lord of Burgundy .
But wait a minute !
Unkindness is powerful , and his unkindness may kill me , but it'll never destroy my love .
That's true , if the devil's judging her .
Farewell , good neighbor .
You have a daughter named Elizabeth , who is virtuous and beautiful , aristocratic and full of grace .
Medicine is for the dogs .
I'm the one , Hamlet .
She's more cunning than anyone can imagine .
You'd think everyone was asleep .
Kingly power seems most like God's power when the king mixes mercy with justice .
I explained how you were deceived , how you were thwarted , the things that were used against you , who was working against you , and a lot of other things that would convince even a half-wit or a crazy person to say , "Banquo did it ! " You explained it all .
By my sword , Beatrice , you love me .
Lord , " he calls you ?
I remember the plan .
All this suggests that she has a good reason for doing this to you .
They can sit out there until they die of hunger and disease .
Take your penalty .
My dear , let's go inside and wait for them to arrive .
Don't stick your head out into the public street to stare at the Christian fools with painted faces .
Your disloyal uncle , are you paying attention ?
Offer yourself more respect , or , not to beat this word to death , you'll offer me the chance to be a laughing-stock .
He leaves me to my own contentment , but that's the one thing I can not find .
It just happens , the way gentle rain drops on the ground .
Dead .
If she offers him her love , it's very possible that he'll scorn it , since , as we all know , he tends to be contemptuous .
That's terrible !
We'll take you there .
Good night .
I have a daughter ( I have her until she gets married ) who's given me this letter , considering it her duty .
Likewise , our common men lie drenched in the blood of princes , and their wounded steeds , ankle-deep in gore , struggle and , raging wildly , stamp on their dead masters with their hooves , killing them a second time .
Brother , you've made a mistake .
There were many even more memorable feasts .
Let him think about his own debt .
The sight of them is offensive .
I agree .
I think he'll carry this island home in his pocket and give it to his son like an apple .
You don't look well , Antonio .
Will you kill him then ?
A drum , a drum !
Will we be separated ?
All other devils who tempt people to treason patch together some motive , put together from shreds
Well , then , I thank you , though I'm such a beggar that even my thanks are not worth much .
We all expect a nice answer from you , Jew .
Listen to me patiently .
We've finished our business .
Where is he now ?
There's only one hope for you , and even that's a kind of illegitimate hope .
I'm more like an ancient Roman than a corrupt modern Dane .
I have no idea how .
Trebonius !
There is nothing distinctive , nothing remarkable left in the world .
What brings him here ?
Hurry now , get the job done .
Listen to me , for I have something to tell you .
Why didn't the jerk come back to me when I called him ?
Don't you have any sense at all ?
Three months from twelve months of the year .
Amen to that , lady .
It's disgraceful !
I still insisted on knowing what the matter was , but you wouldn't answer me , instead giving me an angry wave of your hand and telling me to leave you alone .
Here he comes back .
Shame of what , lady ?
Now I want her more than ever .
Is Scotland the same as when I left it ?
Did I work to make him king for this ?
That was when I was young and inexperienced and didn't know what passion was .
I'm in a mood to beat you up pretty good .
I have more news too .
Where have I been ?
But how strange that Beatrice should seem to know who I was and yet not know at the same time .
I hope I never achieve success if I don't feel some of your heartbroken grief right now .
But who are you ?
Besides , he's young and handsome , and he's got all the qualities that naive and silly girls go for .
I mean a husband .
I'll put up my shield and battle you .
The rapier and the dagger .
Tie up his withered old arms .
Away , away , be gone .
What looks like a horse is quick as thought disfigured by the wind , made as difficult to distinguish as water poured into water .
Take it back .
He picked out the letter "G" from the alphabet and said a wizard told him that "G" will take the throne away from his children .
Meet me and Gratiano at his house in about an hour .
Don't take Helena's side .
The will , the will !
Yes , from top to bottom , sir .
But goodbye .
Save that kind of harsh language for your worst enemy .
At five o'clock he's going to pay me for it .
You don't love me .
There's no face more sincere than one washed in tears .
Now I have to leave .
I will , sir .
Listen !
Only Adam , Rafe , and Gregory were ready .
Here , sir !
Four o'clock in the morning .
I am .
Are you in your right mind ?
What do you think that means ?
Do it , and shout like the city's on fire .
My brother's love , the devil , and my own anger made me do it .
Help me out of here .
Oh , in the duke of Gloucester's wallet .
But if I gave my wife a handkerchief , Then what ?
The devil must be behind this .
His nurse ?
To that end , I presented him with the tennis balls , the perfect expression of his inexperience and frivolity .
What's new with you ?
Soundly , my lord .
But why am I telling you this ?
There's a man haunting this forest who abuses the trees by carving "Rosalind" on their barks .
Conspiracies , fakery , betrayal , and disorder are all that's left until we die .
We will wait on you , your majesty .
And throw this dead peasant into the manure pit. , Regan , I'm bleeding .
I'll have my lessons in the order and manner
Have you ever heard of anything like that , Roderigo ?
Who do you think you are coming in here armed ?
The clock's just striking twelve .
The war's over and the Turks are drowned .
Get out of my sight !
Stop right now !
Regret and everlasting shame sit on our helmets , mocking us .
Gloucester , Gloucester , I want to speak with the Duke of Cornwall and his wife .
Call yourself your own sister , because I want you .
We must remember the gravity of this sad day .
If you poison us , don't we die ?
Tell me to tear up this contract .
If it's me , there's no time as good as this hour of Caesar's death , and no weapon better than your swords , covered with the noblest blood in the world .
Right now ; as fast as she can say the vows .
His nurse , grandmother .
No , he's an ordinary guy who 's got a gentleman for a son , since someone would have to be crazy to let his son become a gentleman before he's achieved that distinction himself .
The violet smells to him the same as it does to me .
I mean well , sir .
That's good .
I won't sleep until I see her , Hortensio .
And Cassio's killed ?
What do you want to do , Desdemona ?
His imagination is making him crazy .
But a terminal disease requires extreme treatment , or nothing at all .
Ha !
Why , what is there to do before I get there ?
My lord ?
will damage your reputation with them , and under ordinary circumstances it would be unfortunate to have them see you as an ogre .
Well , that's what you get to do .
That's as good as proof that the sweet young man's in love .
Hey , Brabantio !
Please , don't take it badly , but I can not and will not give in to you .
My father's ghost , armed !
If you won't leave , then
Where's the Master ?
If they're not honest , they shouldn't look like they are !
Run as if your life depended on it .
Keep beating , my heart , and muscles , don't grow old yet , keep me standing .
Oh , heaven help us !
You must understand , Silius , that it's better to leave something undone than achieve too much fame in your superior's absence .
Why , to keep the eyes on the sides , so that you can see anything that you can't sniff out .
Hold on a second .
Yes , you already hurt me in the church , in the town , and in the fields .
This is how the candle burned the moth .
Now I'll stand up .
Yes , my lord , if you give us permission .
Where are you running so fast ?
Then Caesar and he will always be united .
Yes , or to wear cosmetics ?
There wasn't any problem .
God forbid !
When you avoid one trap , you fall into another .
All right , I'll stop .
I am satisfied , as long as the maiden cities you talk of come with her .
That's not necessary .
He has some wonderful home furnishings , that's what he calls them , that he'll use to decorate his house when he gets one .
You're acting like an ass , don't you think ?
Let's go .
Lucentio !
That is exactly why we wanted you here , your lordship , to avoid the public carping and complaints .
I don't know him .
But I surrender all this magic now , when I've summoned some heavenly music to cast a spell , as I'm doing now , I'll break my staff and bury it far underground , and throw my book of magic spells deeper into the sea than any anchor ever sank .
So you'll bring the necklace to her yourself ?
Never , my lord .
Our noblemen are battling bravely .
Let's hear what Antony has to say .
Then sure ones .
Look out , here she comes .
You look like a person who knows the business of war .
Whether you are sad or merry , the intensity of either suits you like no one else.. .
I tell you , you can use it to get your shoes fixed .
Well , that's certainly out of this world , all right .
I gave my lover a ring and made him swear never to lose it or give it away .
I'll use it for fish bait .
Ever since I've been a free agent in my choice of friends , I've chosen you because you take everything life hands you with calm acceptance , grateful for both good and bad .
He's the most stubborn dog that ever lived among humans .
I have promissory notes from Florence that I have to deliver .
I'll wake him , because that's my job .
Say , isn't this the Latin master Cambio ?
If I have killed your children , I will have children with your daughter .
What we do we have been commanded to do .
Bianca's love made me trade places with Tranio while he masqueraded as me around town .
Your servants are waiting .
Retreat !
I can't recall where I slept last night .
Roderigo !
We'll write it in alternating eight- and six-syllable lines , just like in a ballad .
My lord , most humbly on bended knee I beg you to grant me the leading of the vanguard .
He's in Athens , my lord .
Perform the speech just as I taught you , musically and smoothly .
I'm old and foolish .
Dear son , you're alive !
I've got to go .
You are very welcome here , sir .
I pray to God he isn't .
They're like stomachs and we're just the food .
He has his moods and his ways .
Is that what he says ?
But how will we keep it from being passed now , my lord ?
But even so , we can't do without him .
Don't insult my master's generosity by killing yourself .
The wind that scatters young men throughout the world , encouraging them to seek their fortunes some place other than home , where there's little to be found in the way of experience .
Come here , sir .
But his kindness was nobler than even his desire for revenge , his natural goodness was stronger than his need to give his brother what he deserved .
Everything is a sick joke .
Kill !
I wouldn't marry her , even if she were as blessed as paradise .
So you had time as you were dying to look around ?
As clearly as I see you , my lord .
Truthfully , my name is Cinna .
Can I have some ?
Everybody may do as they please until seven o'clock tonight .
Show me .
Where is that poor rash man ?
He may recover yet .
Oh yes , sir , I have often been to Pisa , Pisa , City of Wise Men .
You call that ranting ?
Hush , Grumio .
Your statue spouting blood through many holes , in which many smiling Romans bathed , means that you'll provide great Rome with sustaining blood , and that great men will strive to get some token of approval from your holy blood .
I could rhyme like that for eight years in a row , excepting meal times and sleeping hours .
I'm begging you , tell me who it is quickly , and speak fast .
There's still the King of France's farewell ceremony .
How's it going ?
Is there anything offensive in it ?
Let me love him because he deserves it , and you can love him because I do .
Fruits and vegetables don't ripen until the right season of the year .
Will they see us ?
Go away .
How exactly have I offended you ?
A horse , a horse , I'd give my kingdom for a horse !
Well , that's the same thing .
My freedom .
Why has your queen , Juno , called me here to this grassy spot ?
Yeah , right , you sent me to get whipped .
Is he still alive ?
Only he acted from honesty and for the general good .
He's busy , can't you hear him giving orders ?
As for your coming in to dinner , just do what you feel is right .
Well then , you have good reason to be sad .
Shame on you , Demetrius !
So , the sun won't shine today !
From this , I conclude that many different elements can work toward one common end , just as many arrows , shot from different points , converge on a single target ; just as many roads meet in a single town ; just as many fresh streams empty into only one salt sea ; just as the many radiuses of a
It's a friend of Antony's .
I wouldn't want a heart like hers even if you made me queen .
What are you saying , Cordelia ?
I came here with a fool's head on my shoulders and now I'm leaving with two. , Goodbye , sweet lady .
Take your time .
No , please , I beg your Majesty .
Helena , we'll tell you about our secret plan .
Wait , look !
Please give in , sweet Hermia. , And Lysander , stop acting like she's yours .
What's all that shouting about ?
He accuses me of withholding his share of Sextus Pompeius' possessions , which we seized in Sicily .
Our country weeps , it bleeds , and each day a fresh cut is added to her wounds .
Just being thanked is more than enough for me , madam .
Sir , I wouldn't say I was your friend , but I've praised you when you deserved ten times more praise than I gave .
Do your best .
Foolish dogs , blindly running straight toward a Russian bear only to have their heads crushed like rotten apples .
I hope you are pleased with the snake .
No , no , the bell .
Most kind messenger , tell great Caesar that through his deputy I kiss his conquering hand .
I will , my lord .
Really , I think your other ruff is better .
Has it come to this ?
And so , ?
I stand here with the law on my side .
Good day , Catesby .
Women are lucky , then .
No , but the barber's assistant has been seen with him .
I must go report what happened .
Now , soldiers , advance .
Good-bye .
You wouldn't have dared to tempt him so .
I have a ship full of treasure .
Go back to bed .
At other times , I know what's what .
I can't run away .
How are you , Hero ?
But the devil that tempted you gave you no reason why you should commit treason other than to win the name of traitor .
No , boy .
The merchandise you bring from Rome is too expensive for me .
That light we see is coming from my hall .
I am Benedick .
Claudio ?
Six Barbary horses , six French swords with accessories , and three imaginatively designed carriages , sounds like a French bet against the Danish .
shifts , friends , to Southampton .
What's this all about ?
Let me see them .
Go , but sign the deed .
Fathers , never trust your daughters just because they act obedient and innocent .
But I can't play a melody .
It persuades you and discourages you .
Give me your arm .
Can you hear me ?
Is that Barnardo ?
What handkerchief ?
We have enough supplies for it , and they've earned it .
Is Fleance going with you ?
Here comes his Majesty .
Well , the peace you pleaded for so eloquently just now lies in his answer .
Knock , sir ?
Is it lost ?
With a doctor's help he might recover and become an ass again .
I remember when I was in love , I broke my sword on a stone , and told him to take that for coming at night to see Jane Smile .
My name's Macbeth .
Now I'll believe that unicorns exist , and that there's a tree in Arabia where the phoenix lives .
I wish I could sleep too , it would stop me from thinking .
The prayers of saints and those that Richard wronged support us like high-walled fortresses .
Oh , he's a gallant king !
Madam , hurry as fast as you can get out of my court .
Be quiet .
Ask your husband if you doubt me .
No , I swear by my life and soul !
With that , I hope God is with him !
If you were the noblest of your family , young man , you couldn't die more honorably .
Let me at her ! .
He's given his empire to a whore , and now they're gathering kings to wage a war .
I sent for Cassio to come talk with you .
Go on ahead .
Please , Rosalind , my sweet cousin , be happy .
Well , my friends , you've got to admit that if you scare the living daylights out of the ladies , they'd have no choice but to execute us .
Do you like pictures ?
There are enough of us still alive in the field to overcome the English with our numbers if we could just restore some kind of order .
But when exactly will we see Benedick married ?
And I'll be eternally grateful to you .
No , I swear it .
A soldier is just a tool , like his sword , unless he has your qualities , Ventidius .
What's that music ?
When you weren't at home , the Senate sent out three different search parties to find you .
Be quiet , be quiet .
I thank you very much on his behalf .
Give me the gown .
Look , here comes Cassio and my husband .
What has the governor of the town decided ?
But do you think that's what he's aiming for ?
Tell me truthfully , do you love my sister ?
What would you like , sir ?
Don't waste any time .
But do you really think the Prince would treat you that way ?
It's true , my lords , he did .
Since Cleopatra died , I have lived in such dishonor that the gods despise my disgrace .
I'd rather be a weed in a hedge than a rose in my brother's garden .
After you , sir .
Hello , Cassio !
And I think that if I hadn't been brave and strong , she would have turned me into a dog and made me her slave .
Fathers who wear rags Make their children neglect them .
Cassio's not dead ?
For you to do it would be good service .
I'd better not drink now .
Though science can explain them away , disasters still come after eclipses .
If only you had a clearer memory of who you are !
Bring in more wine !
It's absurd .
Sir , it's the Moor .
Handkerchief , confessions , handkerchief !
That's some nap .
I swear I do .
O noble English , who could take on the entire French army with only half their forces , leaving the other half to stand by , idle and laughing .
The more fool you for betting on my loyalty .
I'll deliver the message .
No man born from a woman will ever defeat you." So get out of here , disloyal thanes , and join the weak and decadent English !
By that kind of logic , I should hate Orlando , since my father hates his father .
But go on .
If it is , I suggest you don't eat it .
I was not angry since I came to France until this instant .
Here they come .
It's not friendly , and it's not ladylike .
When I said that , I told you the truth .
Why do you go around in circles when you could get to the point ?
It came from a neutral party , not from someone opposed to you .
As his body grows uglier with age , his mind rots away as well .
It's over here .
I'll be right here , silent .
But there's reason for me to look more closely at this schoolmaster .
No , I'm sure your Grace won't be able to persuade him to try a second round , even though you couldn't dissuade him from trying the first .
I know that Regan will taste just like Goneril , both of them sour crabapples .
If you look closely at Alexander's life , Harry of Monmouth's stands up fairly well by comparison , for there are analogies in everything .
He's a devil , a born devil , who can never be trained .
It
Is all of this about your father ?
Just looking at him gives me heartburn .
Can we finish our lunch ?
Thank you .
This is a lowlife who basks in the reflection of the fading glory of the woman he works for. , Get out of my sight , scoundrel !
I'm hanging on every word .
My evidence that you have wronged me is that you condemned and disgraced Lucius Pella for taking bribes here from the Sardinians , and you ignored my letters , where I argued that he was innocent ; I know the man .
There's always a breath of fresh air here .
We'll give you an answer tomorrow .
Who's shouting ?
I know my rights .
Why did you send so many ?
Your master is a wise and honorable Roman .
Wear both the ring and my heart , because both are yours .
Yes , fashion is fashion .
My words are dull .
It doesn't excuse your cruel behavior .
Do you ?
Heaven help us !
You're not leaving the house today .
Go home !
If you don't like him you should quit .
It's fair game to mark a coward .
No .
He gives BIONDELLO Here comes Baptista .
Tell me why , if you can .
I feel better already , and I know there's more good advice where that came from .
Dromio , you drone , you snail , you slug , you idiot !
What can we do to find out if it's true ?
Fifteen years !
Didn't I ?
Isn't my fortune just a little better than hers ?
And in her eyes I see a fire that would seem to burn away the lies the princes have told about her chastity .
I swear , before I die I'm going to see you sick with love .
Along with this strange power , he also has the gift of prophecy and various other abilities .
If you continue treating Hermia so badly , you'll pay for it .
Even What , were you all snarling before I arrived , ready to catch each other by the throat like dogs , but now that I'm here , you turn your hatred toward me ?
Where's this so-called king ?
I wouldn't want to stay here and make you angry .
Both of which , master constable , You have .
Make it eight and eight .
Take it off and throw it on the ground .
Lieutenant , I think you know I'm your friend .
I know this quality in you , Brutus , it's as familiar to me as your face .
I'm going to cry .
My sweet Cassio !
Here's the story we'll tell her : that I was with you at your shop , watching you make her necklace , and that you're going to deliver it tomorrow .
It was just like in real life , dark brown with silver whiskers in it .
What else ?
I'll agree to those terms and even say that Jews are nice .
Please , give it to me .
Listen !
Indeed , it's a strange time .
Good-bye .
Show us the way without further delay. , Trinculo , since the king and all our comrades are drowned , we're the heirs of this place. , Here , carry my wine bottle. , Trinculo , my buddy , we'll get that bottle refilled soon enough .
Maybe she's just pretending .
No , my lord , it's been four months .
Didn't I use to have four or five women taking care of me ?
Oh , how I wish we could oppose Caesar's spirit , his overblown ambition , and not hack up Caesar himself !
But no matter , I'll get back at him soon enough .
Come on , Iago .
That's why your desires are wolfish , bloody , and ravenous .
What features ?
So here's the plan .
No , I don't .
Referee !
Neither the sky nor the earth have been quiet tonight .
And I see you survived your time in Egypt .
It's dark , like my shoe .
When ?
My royal lord , you're not entertaining the guests .
If I could say hello to the fifth one as happily as I'll say goodbye to the first four , I'd be very happy he's coming .
The English army , sir .
What , there's going to be a masquerade ?
The foul plan backfired on me .
She can't deny it .
Not true .
Ah , don't tear yourself away from me !
Passionately" ?
Call my knights together .
What do you mean , the seventh cause ?
Give me an aphrodisiac , pharmacist .
Ask this man's forgiveness , love him , and accept his offer .
And as for his dreams , I'm surprised he's so foolish as to trust the fantasies of a restless night .
Many former friends of ours have gathered to meet the fleet and aren't willing to beat it back .
Good countrymen , let me leave alone .
Not if the minor ones come up first .
Live , Brutus !
God doesn't need to use indirect or illegal means to kill those who have offended him .
Come on .
We'll be there .
Or should I describe you as the one who killed her brothers and her uncles ?
Now he's saying how she took him into our bedroom .
You've heard a lot .
What shall I do for you ?
Caesar , I will .
So that she may live , I'll say I cheated on Edward and that she is not really his child .
Ah , here comes my messenger. , What's going on , you crazy spirit ?
Are you sad about that ?
Come , driver !
But since Laertes is better , we've given him a handicap .
Who does it gallop for ?
He's walking over there , sir .
That's how someone who's been murdered should look , and that's how I look .
Enobarbus , Antony has sent you all your treasure , with generous gifts besides .
Here comes Ensign Pistol and his wife .
Why Dover ?
I'm not asking you to call her .
Please , leave me alone .
I'll read you a sermon .
He was so sharp when he was in school .
The question is , how would being king change him ?
But this is bad !
I changed my mind .
I would give all my glory for a mug of ale and safety .
Ah , poor ghost !
Your Highness just told me that I should ride there before you .
If you want to cry over my bad luck , I'll give you my eyes .
Demetrius is an admirable man .
My voice is ragged .
Caesar , the clock has struck eight .
Brother , Quiet .
I admit I'm only a woman , but nevertheless I'm the woman Lord Brutus took for his wife .
Give me a little breathing space , my lord , a little pause to think .
It has the mark of
Any man can get drunk sometime .
When will he be here ?
There are reasons and causes why and how in everything .
It's impossible .
I'm being repaid for that now .
Oh , eastern star !
Beware of March 15th .
But if you decide not to marry me , you'll marry this faithful shepherd instead ?
But you're wrong .
What do you think , madam ?
Follow them straight to the cottage .
A nice stool .
I would rip his heart out in public and eat it .
Come on , noble captain .
Lily-livered coward , what's he doing there ?
I'll straighten it , then play , Where's the Queen ?
Go on .
Then she has no choice but to hate you , as you purchased her love with murder .
Oh , come on .
Do you want to go in and join the party ?
Yes , I think that's true .
Yes , and a nice one at that .
I have news from Rome , my good lord .
Princes and counts !
We were about to have our noses snapped off by two old men with no teeth .
Seriously , I think our clothes are as fresh now as they were the day we put them on in Africa , when we attended the marriage of the king's daughter Claribel to the King of Tunis .
May God's blessing go with you and with all who turn bad into good , and enemies into friends !
I need to speak a word with you .
Did you say Cassio ?
Did you say all ?
A good laugh .
Keep an eye on her , Moor .
For , as I am a soldier , the name I think suits me best , once I begin my attack on Harfleur again , I will not leave the half-conquered town until she lies buried in her own ashes .
Macbeth will never be defeated until Birnam Wood marches to fight you at Dunsinane Hill .
Well , let it strike ten then .
crowned by the golden sun , observed his heroic son and smiled to see him mangle the work of nature , French youth whose fathers and God had nurtured for twenty years , since they were babies .
Will you come ?
Well , we'll stop , then .
Follow" ?
Gracious Queen , even Herod of Judea wouldn't dare look at you unless you were in a good mood .
Call it a match !
Good heavens !
Your Majesty , see here , if it won't offend your Grace , what a complete , rascally , beggarly , lousy rat this is .
What business is it of yours ? , Father , be quiet .
There , take my fool's cap .
Come on in , tailor .
You have , my lord .
I'll tear her to pieces !
The duke will drink under this tree. , He's been looking for you all day , you know .
Oh , to think that the same body that once ruled the world could now patch up a wall !
You're a fool .
I overheard him and his plans .
He was also shocked to learn that on the same day you fought the rebels you also fought against the army of Norway , and that you weren't the least bit afraid of death , even as you killed everyone around you .
I'm about to fly away .
Oh , be quiet .
What an idiot that monster is !
You can take your chances after dinner .
Should I strike it with my spear ?
I think she's the most wonderful woman I've ever laid eyes on .
Did you see how he laughed about sleeping with her ?
Silvius , tell this youth what it means to be in love .
Is my ink and paper ready ?
Goodbye , boy .
It was a rough night .
A rotten , foolish monster .
Oh , traitors , villains !
You talk like a child , but you're very smart anyway .
Who's there ?
Do as I asked you .
Listen !
Where is he , in his bed ?
The higher the Nile flows , the better the harvest .
Skip over all the particularities between then and Harry's return to France .
Yes , she said that .
Who ?
If it's really you , tell me what happened to our son , who floated away with you on that deadly raft .
I hope Demetrius comes to love you as much as you love him !
If your Majesties recall it , the Welsh fought very valiantly in a garden where there were leeks growing , wearing leeks in their Monmouth caps which , your Majesty knows , is to this day a badge of honorable military service .
Sure , but don't do it at full volume until there's no danger in it .
Keep an eye on him .
No , please , save it for dinner conversation .
Thank God , thank God !
It's getting late .
Hail !
Come , let's have an early dinner so that we have time to work out our plans .
He knows that you didn't embrace Antony because you loved him , but because you feared him .
He and Lepidus are at Caesar's house .
I'll never speak to you again .
I'd say the same thing , but I'm afraid I'd be faced out of my way .
Now , by my mother's son , and that's me , it will be moon or star or whatever I want before I'll travel to your father's house .
You don't know me , but I know you're an important person .
Yes , as kind as snow to a harvest .
In Alexandria he condemned Rome , and that's not all .
The reasons for his death are recorded in the Capitol .
What are you going to do ?
Then see the evidence of their evil with your own eyes .
Your lily-white lips , your cherry-red nose , and your buttercup-yellow cheeks are gone , gone forever .
Oh , my heart , my heart is rising into my throat !
It goes along with being born to greatness , but it makes you get badmouthed by every fool who only has his own suffering to care about .
Inside , sir , with the earl .
Look , my little spirit is sitting in a foggy cloud waiting for me .
What villains did this to you ?
Yes , you did , sir .
Say something again .
I'm even happier that I'm not stupid , and I can learn .
Are they all ready ?
Innocent sweethearts , you have no idea who's responsible for your father's death .
By the future .
How old are you , friend ?
Good night .
Cast spells with them , and "Brutus" will call up a ghost as well as "Caesar." Now , in the name of all the gods , I ask you what food does Caesar eat that has made him grow so great ?
Good job , my little one .
And then Pyramus showed up .
If they refuse to come , get physical , use a whip if you have to , but get them out here to their husbands .
Dead , dead ?
What's going on , my love ?
And look how he's repaid poor Clarence for his loyalty , penned him up like a pig being fattened for slaughter .
With his natural luck , he will beat you even against the odds .
Okay , just stay quiet .
Please don't ruin any more of my poems by reading them so badly .
Please , don't be sad , and don't tell me how reluctant you are .
This feather moved because of her breath .
I see that you are here , but I'd like you to go there and then come back again .
Stop , for God's sake !
I'm tired of this moon .
My God , it's morning .
Doesn't everyone want a wife like that ?
Then die and be damned !
Sir , I have no future ahead of me .
Let the old ruffian discover that I have many other ways to die , and in the meantime , we'll laugh at his challenge .
What were those things ?
Here come Brabantio and the brave Moor .
By this sword , I'll kill whichever one of you makes the first thrust .
Tell him to greet the king of England with our sharp defiance .
You take my house away when you take the money I need for upkeep .
Don't follow me .
We'll meet Macbeth there .
You can't stay here any longer .
He won't fight with me , Domitius ?
No , nor could the devil's name be more frightening .
Your ear is good .
This is not a maiden , as you say , but an old man , wrinkled , faded , and withered .
He's speaking now , or perhaps he's whispering , "Where's my serpent of the Nile ? " For that's his pet name for me .
Sextus Pompeius is sailing toward the port of Rome .
I must admit your offer is the best .
You couldn't beat the two of them apart .
Yes .
Eighty ducats !
See , the snail already has its horns , which prevents nasty rumors from spreading about his wife's infidelity .
Bless you , master .
Normally I would ask you what your name is first .
I'll meet you there .
Antony" was divided between her heart and lips .
Is her voice pitched high or low ?
He exposed Edgar's murderous plot , and was wounded , as you see there , when trying to apprehend him .
I myself am the King of Naples , since I saw with my own eyes , these eyes that haven't been dry since , my father killed in a shipwreck .
They're just flattering me .
He had a thousand noses and twisted horns , like wave crests in a storm at sea .
My children would have enjoyed a better death if God had blessed you with a purer life .
What are you talking about , man ?
If he asks to see me , tell him I'm sick and went to bed .
Mountains don't tremble , however much the wind may blow !
What is my nation ?
So don't think that I'm drunk .
I'm sure I can answer for him , he doesn't know any , either .
Then keep your vow , fellow , when you meet the man .
Look with your ears .
How are you , Charmian ?
Would I send a lie ?
Why did I just send you home ?
Nobody's that bad .
That ?
Why is that cauldron sinking ?
It's a wild night .
Write down "Master Gentleman Conrade." , Gentlemen , are you good Christians , and do you serve God ?
God , I'm really sick .
It has come again .
I am dying ! , My lord , you still have one eye left to see Cornwall punished .
If there is , then heaven help him !
The Queen will be treated fairly if she gives me up ?
No more than twenty-five .
Guard them carefully until we decide how to punish them .
He could never bear carnation .
Here it is .
I've never known any woman or seen a woman's face , except my own in the mirror .
You flea , you louse , you winter cricket !
This is the day I'm going to get what I wished for when I wished that the person I most trusted would betray me .
Let's go .
An honest guy who's as poor as the king .
Then he swore he was a stranger here .
Our poor father , Clarence !
He's very handsome .
What an idiot I was to think this drunkard was a god and to worship such a stupid fool !
Therefore , do your duty and take your reward , because my master and mistress are nearly frozen to death .
You'll become a wood salesman and buy nothing but clubs from me .
Yes , he has .
I rejoice in his good fortune .
I've worked it out .
So use your discretion .
Very pleased to meet you , my lord .
It should work .
Sport ?
I won't say anything negative about what he might be .
He's running bareheaded , calling for the end of the world , out there on a night like this , when even savage animals ravenous with hunger crawl under cover and hide .
I'll leave you now .
Can I have a word with you , Lucillius ?
You resent my friends ' rise in society , and my own .
Say goodbye to your sisters .
Oh , monster , we know secondhand clothes when we see them. , Take off that gown , Trinculo .
Tonight he boarded a treasure ship .
Good morning , Brutus .
Healing is part and parcel of my religious vows ; it is a charitable duty my order performs .
Meet me down at the harbor. , Come here .
My lord , he refuses to come .
Up to the breach , you dogs !
Thomas , the earl of Surrey , and he were moving from troop to troop around twilight cheering up the soldiers .
This is the place .
Dear Duke , please listen to what I have to say .
He speaks bluntly , madam .
That's a nice hat you've got there .
This island belongs to me because Sycorax , my mother , left it to me .
If he loves Caesar , then he can only hurt himself , by grieving and dying for Caesar .
But his navy rules the sea .
Your light dulls when he is near .
Let it fly out .
This is healthy talk .
Let quick sulfurous lightning , strong enough to split enormous trees , singe the white hair on my head .
He'll find out soon what happened in England .
No , the one I gave you .
I know , prince .
Listen , listen !
I have a lot to tell you about them .
I've left our luggage on the ship , and I bought the oil , balm , and liquor you wanted .
It was yesterday , your highness .
Go ahead and ask her .
I've done a bad thing , for which I will blame myself so much that I'll never be happy again .
Could the lead one contain it ?
I wish we were safely on board our ship already .
But I need to remember I'm related to him by blood , not behavior .
Ah , dear Nature , my goddess , listen to me !
Now is the time when we need your help .
So be it .
Or are you just teasing ?
I beg your pardon .
It's as common for us old people to assume we know more than we do as for young people to be too wild and crazy .
He's getting worse and worse .
Where do I live ?
From this moment on I have a higher opinion of you than before .
The best thing to do is crawl under his cloak .
I've relinquished my authority , so please , I'll see you all before long .
A nice coincidence , my lord .
Madam , you have to go to your uncle's .
If only I could spit poison .
I will not do them wrong .
The best way to be happy is to be in between .
I am their aunt , and I love them like a mother .
Where are the thousand
Good Portia , go to bed .
What , you dare put your hands on me , villain ?
I won't consider it .
Yes , that's why you have to die .
She will have a seat , you heard my daughter tell you how .
If I let myself do what I yearn to , I'd rip the flesh off your bones .
Look out , I'm on my way up .
Here , you goddamn incest-breeding Danish murderer , drink this .
My God , it's the same one I gave the judge !
Your wife , Fulvia , mustered her army first .
Oh , I wish I were a man !
Who's there ?
What's going on between you two ?
Go get me a crow .
So I suppose your grace can truly say that I have lost it .
What , is he scared of a gun that only fired a blank ?
But like an unruly deer , he's always trespassing past the park borders and straying away from home to feed in new pastures .
You'll find out everything in due time .
You wanted to be king of the island , sir ?
I don't deny it .
My God , do you think I'm easier to manipulate than a pipe ?
Please , just wait a minute .
A friend .
Don't shed any blood , or cut less or more than exactly a pound of flesh .
Where's that music coming from ?
You're helping the storm , not us .
I'm not .
You are too evil for words !
When we were alone , we agreed that in public she would go on being unpleasant .
Who pays their way ?
Please , please tell me !
Do you have what I told you to get ?
Where's Monsieur Mustardseed ?
Do you really mean to go after this wildcat ?
Then what's Antony ?
Good idea .
This is going even better than I planned .
I hope they don't attack us now .
His glory has not been diminished where he earned it , nor have those offenses for which he was killed been exaggerated .
Not even to get her fan , or her gloves , or her mask , or anything ?
Kiss him for that , good widow .
God knows I loved my niece , and now she's dead , slandered to death by cowards who would just as likely fight a real man as I would grab a poisonous snake by the tongue .
I'd like to munch on some good dry oats .
Is your name William ?
That may be true , my lord .
They call us drunks and insult our noble titles .
Is that how it is , countrymen ?
I have as much of our father in me as you do , though I admit you're closer to him and matter more because you're older .
By God , I order you to speak .
I think you're all either bewildered or stark raving mad .
The Count sent me an excellent pair of perfumed gloves .
Oh , that arrow was well shot .
Well , I can not tell how my difficult life has weathered my face , but I will never let those difficulties subdue my courage .
It's true , that wasn't such a nice thing to do .
Isn't this war against me ?
So the fool follows you .
Fight valiantly today .
What have you done ?
I beg your pardon for loving you too much .
Please remember , love .
I've had very little joy as England's queen .
The king has heard them , but as yet has made no answer .
This fellow will out-talk us all .
How could so many people , under two masters , get along under one roof ?
I don't like that .
By all that's holy , here comes Katherina !
To find you .
Listen , Signor Bassanio , there's nothing to worry about .
Oh , quick , before I'm gone .
Pay attention to the music .
Are they getting rusty ?
Just as I told you , he usually sleeps in the afternoon .
Who's winning ?
On top of this , they've either burned or carried away everything that was in the king's tent .
And your father was Duke of Milan , and you were his heir , a princess .
How are you , my ladies ?
Go away and take your children .
Tomorrow , sir , I'm fighting for my reputation , and any man who gets away without a broken bone or two is an exceptional wrestler indeed .
Yes , I'll say it again , my lord .
You haven't got it in you to frown or look displeased or bite your lip as angry women do .
But please tell me more .
It's good to grow .
No , just listen to me .
Farewell , and thanks .
Tell her that the king , who has the power to command people , asks her .
What are you going to do for a father ?
Today our hopes are at an end .
You'd better bring the messenger safely through the lines so he can return .
You'll pay for this if I ever see you face-to-face in the daylight .
She will wither and come to a bad end .
They shout for joy .
What's the problem ?
The general got rid of us early tonight so he could be with Desdemona. , I can't blame him .
You haven't heard of the war brewing between the Dukes of Cornwall and Albany ?
Any strange beast there can be considered a man .
Ah ha !
Therefore tell me , fairest Katherine , will you have me ?
I've sent twenty people to look for you .
I thank my heart , the poor fool , for it keeps away from seriousness .
You think I care what I'm called ?
Give me my sword .
Protect me , my friends .
No , taking you away from your new marriage would be like showing a child a new coat and then not letting him wear it .
Will you be crowned tomorrow ?
Oh sirs , consider this : those who sent you to do this deed will hate you for doing it .
Order him to advance his forces first thing , and we'll follow .
Varrus and Claudio !
We're ready if our minds are ready .
It's true , I confess .
Yes , yes !
I'll debate this with you later , and then I'll teach you to listen more carefully .
I'll hide in the arbor .
Oh , darling Phoebe , if you ever fall in love with some fresh face , then you'll know about the invisible wounds that love's sharp arrows can make .
Please walk softly , so not even a mole hears us approach .
With patience , noble lord , as prisoners must .
That will tell you a lot .
Yes , he is dead .
Just as I did with the meat , I'll make up some problem with the way the bed is made , and throw the pillow one way and the cushion the other , and the blanket over here and the sheets over there .
Think about it carefully .
Should I tell you why ?
To the breach , to the breach !
Just now .
Our tolerance for slavery and oppression shows us to be weak , like women .
Yes , madam .
Lucius !
Off with his son George's head !
Gremio , this is no time to compete over how deeply we love Bianca .
He only lived long enough to become a man , and as soon as he proved that he was a man by fighting like one , he died .
Pay for something I never got ?
They're saying I'd be an animal without a heart if I stayed home today out of fear .
Keep listening .
I'm here , full of anger , to complain about my daughter Hermia. , Step forward , Demetrius. , My lord , this man , Demetrius , has my permission to marry her. , Step forward , Lysander. , But this other man , Lysander , has cast a magic spell over my child's heart. , You , you , Lysander , you've given her poems , and exchanged tokens of love with my daughter .
Play with me , Charmian .
Is this face Hero's ?
Yet Brutus says he was ambitious , and Brutus is an honorable man .
Wait a minute , gentlemen .
If she's a traitor , why then , so am I .
He keeps tearing out his white hair , which the blindly raging winds catch up and blow away into nothingness .
How did you get this letter ?
Grumio , get me my horse .
You are completely wrong about this king .
Let fortune and victory be yours !
Why not ?
I'm doing so .
Will he bring his army ?
At Pembroke , or at Harfordwest in Wales .
Have you come from Bellario's office in Padua ?
They're murdering Caesar ! " Who's there ?
Are you going to let us in ?
I beg your pardon .
Let's assume that she has a reason , which you don't know yet : have faith that she'll eventually explain why she shut the doors on you today .
Oh , Corin , I wish you could understand how much I love her !
And mine say two hundred .
Do you hear , my friend ?
What is that bloody knife ?
Take me to Antony .
Young man , have you challenged Charles the Wrestler ?
But Brutus says he was ambitious , and Brutus is an honorable man .
My arm is sore .
What's keeping you ?
Really , he's very witty , and full of wise sayings .
Our tattered navy has reassembled and set sail , as formidable as the sea itself .
Which of these bad things happened to him ?
Give me your hand .
Right this instant , I'm going to Caesar's funeral .
What was that cry for ?
He's a good soldier too , lady .
Then why did you have to stick it in your pocket in such a hurry ?
Oh , God help me !
Where's your sparkle now ?
That's good advice .
Those island-bred skeletons , terrified for their bones , are an offensive sight on the morning field .
Oh , Isis , that's impossible .
Don't kneel , noble Portia .
If he did that , it would be a charitable deed to hang him .
I'll never see the likes of him again .
She's crying .
Then , to answer every man briefly , wisely , and truthfully , wisely I say , I am a bachelor .
No , really , I'm not .
You are not , Cassius .
What , my good lord ?
Then there's the Count Palatine .
You horrid slave , you can't be trained to be good , and you're capable of anything evil !
What's his name ?
Just remember who you've got on board with you , good man .
She always has to have a light next to her .
Didn't this frighten our captains , Macbeth and Banquo ?
That's what the bill says .
Oh God , Benedick will plague him like a disease !
The sun will never be seen by such royal eyes again .
Well , it doesn't matter anymore .
Me , marry her ?
I've never been taught how to make anything .
And if he fails at that , he will find other ways to kill you .
With all my heart .
What's new , cousin Lodovico ?
What do you think , will my friends prove loyal ?
We hope you feel better and find some peace .
Yes , my lord .
The Bishop of Ely has fled to Richmond , and Buckingham , backed by a hardy Welsh army , is on the march .
I'm very sorry I was so hard on him .
Father , wife , friends , farewell !
No , he has only a little beard .
You insolent rascal , what trade ?
I did , and now I've got it !
Make yourself comfortable .
That's Cassio's voice .
Lay her in the ground , and let violets bloom from her lovely and pure flesh !
You old traitor , repent all your sins .
Fa , sol , la , mi .
Here , Fluellen , stick this in your cap .
But I won't leave this spot , no matter what they do .
When I said that , I was angry too .
And since you know you can see yourself best by reflection , I'll be your mirror and show you , without exaggeration , things inside you that you can't see .
And you , good farmers , whose limbs were made in England , show us here the vigor of your upbringing .
What income , what profit does it bring in ?
So , thank God , there is no real need for me , as I wouldn't be able to help you much .
I swear by Jupiter I'll never revoke this punishment .
What kind of game is this ?
To kill the boys with the luggage !
What , you want them to weep our horses ' blood ?
Oh , dear !
The ones you've sent our lunatic king to .
How can I help you , sir ?
She has a body , not a life .
On a night like this , young Lorenzo swore he loved her very much , stealing her heart with vows of love , but not one vow was true .
Goodbye .
Did you call me , my lord ?
Liar and slave !
If it's the same one , If it's the same one , or any one that belongs to her , then together with the other evidence it's pretty strong .
Rome has lost the ability to raise noble men !
You can't mean it , Tranio !
Now , Signior Petruchio , how are you getting on with my daughter ?
I led them on in this frightened , distracted state , and left sweet
I said you had a fine wit .
He's my prisoner .
Why are you giving me his title ?
The more I hate him , the more he follows me around .
Brutus , you give a nice speech along with your evil strokes .
Oh yes , three thousand ducats .
But as I said , the general isn't really in the mood to hear music now .
The day will come when you'll wish I could help you cast spells against this poisonous , hunchbacked toad .
There's my hat !
I'd hate to see you drowned in honey , sir .
As for my wife , if only you had such a wife .
Listen up , uncle .
Queen Margaret saw your sword steaming with his blood .
Actually , it's not so unusual when you think about it .
Leave him to my wrath. , Edmund , go with my sister-in-law .
But you turn that sun into a shadow .
Yes , and don't let anyone come in , or else I'll break your head .
No more than a minute ?
I want to measure the extent of your love , to see how far it stretches .
Why ?
Do you hear us , sir ?
Yes , my lord .
Yes , my lord .
Villains , you didn't do even that much when your vile daggers struck each other as they hacked up Caesar's sides .
Is that true ?
Watch me like a hawk .
If you leave like that , you tell the world that it's not worthy of a good-bye .
I tell you , you've ruined her gown .
It's true , this so-called "god" , he shook .
You go ahead , and I will follow you .
What did I do ?
But , Lepidus , go to Caesar's house .
I beg you , Strato , stay by me .
I hope to see good days , and many of them .
And I'll turn you into a spirit like us , so you won't die as humans do. , Come here , Peaseblossom , Cobweb , Moth , and Mustardseed !
No , lieutenant , God , gentlemen , Help , Lieutenant , sir , Montano , Help , men ! , The night guard is coming !
Be bold , and get ready .
There's a feud between the two dukes .
We'll both be safer if we go separate ways .
It's my men who should call me "lord." I'm your man , your fellow .
Or at least that's what I plan to do before I let you go .
And it's all your fault .
There is no jewel like Rosalind .
But please , tell me the worst thing that could happen to me if I refuse to marry Demetrius .
Oh , with his sordid desertion , he sets the example for our own .
Have a safe trip .
You can't have anything but the penalty , to be taken at your peril , Jew .
The play's the thing to uncover the conscience of the king .
Tonight we'll have dinner .
No , I know that you're Signior Lucentio .
Who can explain this to me ?
Oh , no .
Farewell .
Okay , now I'm dead .
Only the adulterous and abominable Antony abandons you , giving his power to a whore who turns that power against us .
By Hercules , I think I'm right .
Good .
How do you mean ?
Goodbye .
Today I'm going to get what I said I wished would happen to me if I was ever false to King Edward's children or his wife's allies .
Whoever's a real friend should strike me dead .
When I fell in love with Othello I made up my mind that I wanted to live with him .
The sky shows countless stars .
Uncle !
Halt !
If the English had any sense , they would run away .
You know me well .
What I'm saying is , your jealousy has pushed your husband away from his sanity .
The beautiful Helen of Troy had a thousand suitors .
My brother whom , aside from you , I loved more than anyone else in the world , I trusted to run my state , which at that time was the strongest in the land , and Prospero the number one duke , famous for my dignity and my education .
Come over here .
Who here is so barbarous that he doesn't want to be a Roman ?
They'll kill us !
What's the matter here , gentlemen ? , Honest Iago , you look upset .
But I guess it doesn't matter .
Petruchio , let's stand over here awhile .
But what's the upshot of her admiration ?
Even though it's early , there are already a thousand armored soldiers waiting for you at the harbor .
Do you know whom you're talking to ?
No , that's the truth .
Come , take away the Here comes Master Signior Leonato with the sexton .
As for the rest of the ships , I scattered them , and they've gathered again in the Mediterranean , sailing sadly home to Naples , believing that they witnessed the shipwreck and death of their great king .
Merciful God !
You're doing the right thing .
What did I keep for myself ?
It's good you found me .
If that's true , it's a serious fault , and Caesar has paid seriously for it .
Come on , let's go to prison .
The king is getting up .
Please , tell me your cure .
Let's hope we never need your help for anything .
Hail to you , thane of Glamis !
I'll get it from you , I swear .
Drowning is for cats or blind puppies , don't drown yourself !
Oh God , what a heinous sinner I am , being ashamed to be my father's child !
Pish !
So , perhaps , did yours .
Come , everyone .
On my knee , I humbly ask your blessing .
By God , it does look like a camel .
Every glass of liquor is damned , and the devil's the main ingredient !
He brings great news .
Petruchio ?
He said he was going to buy me a necklace , but I never saw it .
The captain , give it to the captain .
I can be discreet in honorable matters , ride a horse , run , tell a good story badly , and deliver a plain message bluntly .
Caesar himself is in trouble and there are more adversaries than we expected .
Now I am sure that eyes can't hurt a person .
It is only as high as it is and moves with its own legs .
Lovers , moan and weep .
I shouldn't make you do more than you're able .
A house , a person ?
You're a funny man , sir .
Cassio , do you know who might have stabbed you like this ?
Meet me in a little while at the citadel .
Ma'am , my master's coming .
The enemy is making its appearance on the battlefield .
The size of my sorrow must be as great as its source .
Isn't there any other rite you can perform ?
If not , leave me alone , and I'll stay away from your turf .
I don't even have one to throw at a dog .
I'll teach you to drink hard by the time you leave .
And what's your connection with the traitors who landed in our kingdom recently ?
If you've got any music that can't be heard , then play that .
What , would you have me beg for my food ?
Drawing your sword on a woman ?
From the time I was seventeen , over sixty years ago , I have lived in this house , but now I will live here no more .
If luck deserts us today , it's because we defy it .
Convince him that he has been out of his mind , and when he says he's out of his mind My lord , I promise we will play our parts so skillfully that he will believe everything we tell him .
Now , I'm very pleased with it being outdoors , but in its not being at the court , it is boring .
Look , here it is .
Your master and his servant are here .
They're coming .
Good-bye !
You should be ashamed , generals !
Would you try to lift Mount Olympus ?
A sword's too heavy for you to wear .
They don't want you to go out today .
Look how the moon seems to be sleeping with its lover and can't be awoken !
I ordered that the sleeves be cut out and sewed up again , and I'll prove it in combat even if your little finger is armed with your thimble .
Oh , it's dreadful , dreadful , Iago !
Shut up .
This is his second fit like this .
Do you want to sleep ?
Why didn't you say "the swift steps" of time instead of the "lazy foot" ?
You asked for justice , so rest assured you'll get more justice than you bargained for .
That's like building a bridge wider than the river it crosses .
it pleases you , I'll meet you in the marketplace at five and will keep you company until bedtime .
Yes , why not , my lord ?
To find a husband for her sister .
Error in the bill , sir , error in the bill !
No you haven't , cousin .
Who's closest to him ?
No , my noble lord .
How are you feeling now ?
The court awards it and the law authorizes it .
Go on , Caesar .
My dear friends , thanks for your patience .
Are you squinting at me ?
and patches of righteousness .
Officers , what crime have these men committed ?
No lady could be more miserable than I if you two disagree .
Yes , very much like a whale .
Keep an eye on Cinna .
Who delivered it ?
To hell with this idiot !
There's a nice reason why the constellation Pleiades has only seven stars in it .
Lead me to where you're standing .
Somebody's knocking .
This man said , sir , that Don John , the Prince's brother , was a villain .
Jesus , he's an ass if there ever was one !
He'll do whatever Hastings does .
That's treason !
Tell me .
Make us your agents of revenge , so we can praise you when we're victorious !
Come on , Balthasar , let's hear that song again .
Stanley , what news do you have ?
If they march along unopposed , I will sell my dukedom for a sodden , filthy farm in that craggy isle of Albion .
Let me live here forever .
I have it on me here .
Tell her we mean her no disrespect .
And as for my soul , how can the ghost endanger that , since it's as immortal as the ghost is ?
Yes , and these .
I'll stop by before you go to bed , and tell you what I've heard .
What are you doing with a sword ?
What's going on here , general ?
Who's sounding that alarm ?
You wrong me in every way .
Strangle her in her bed , the same bed she's contaminated .
All right , we'll see you at dinnertime .
And I swear to God he's very smart .
And what should I give you that would be equal in value to this rare and precious gift ?
Where are you going ?
Pay you ?
Show me , or at least prove it beyond the shadow of a doubt .
Yes , by God !
Well , Brutus , you're noble .
So , are you done ?
I was talking to some Venetians down by the shore , and the fool showed up .
I insist , don't be more distressed than I am .
I'm left with nothing to do in this weak , idle peacetime , unless I want to look at my lumpy shadow in the sun and sing about
Why do you care that he loves Hermia ?
Oh , shut up !
Name them .
He can act as brave as he wants , but I believe on a cold night like this he wishes he were neck-deep in the Thames , and I wish he were , too , and I with him , whatever the danger , so long as we were far away from here .
From the earth , or the air ?
We need some oracle to tell us what's going on .
Greetings , my lady , and may God always be with you .
Please invite them in .
If you keep on the way you've been going , you'll kill yourself .
Did this fool with the yellow face feast and celebrate in my house today while the guilty doors shut in my face and locked me out of my own house ?
Now I see that all three of them have gotten together to play this cruel trick on me .
Get away from me !
How many people who are humble now would be great then ?
Your request came at a time when the poisonous effects of reveling caused me to be unaware of my own actions .
If they let you off , then we'll have to assume that Lady Justice has lost all her power .
Let's not stay here with them .
As for myself , it was Greek to me .
Antonio's a good man .
I'm sure you do .
Tonight I'll throw through his window a few letters in different handwriting , as if they came from several citizens , all testifying to the great respect Romans have for Brutus , and all alluding to Caesar's unseemly ambition .
I think one of them is nearby and can't get away .
I'm sorry .
Who , him ?
You want proof ?
If my eyes don't deceive me , you are my daughter .
Doesn't the sun shine palely down on them , as though in contempt , killing their fruit with frowns ?
But not the woman who scolds , anyway , I hope .
Why , no , boy .
So will I .
Our fate depends on this chance .
Your father is a sailmaker in Bergamo .
In the high and mighty Roman Empire , just before the emperor Julius Caesar was assassinated , corpses rose out of their graves and ran through the streets of Rome speaking gibberish .
Hey !
Tell me your secrets .
Remember me .
Stay calm .
Let me say first , madam , that he is well .
My daughter told me everything .
If you happen to see Horatio and Marcellus , who are supposed to stand guard with me tonight , tell them to hurry .
What's the matter ?
What Tranio did , he did at my command .
I shall , King Harry .
Madam , not yet .
No , no , he's dead .
Search high and low , in every acre of the fields , and bring him here for me to see him .
Where have you been , boy ?
That makes you an even bigger villain. , Well , throw him out , and have my officers seize his house and lands .
Have you ever slept before while such a terrible deed was done ?
I don't think there's a single unhappy subject living under the protection of your government .
Get into your cold beds and warm yourselves up .
Now he'll work himself up to a fury .
which any peace-lover can do .
I could have blown up the town in an hour .
That's exactly what I'll do , my love , and I hope you'll do the same .
These lovers are saying some strange things , Theseus .
The more I try to hide what I'm feeling , the bigger it gets .
I think there must be something invigorating about death , since she dies with such enthusiasm .
As faithful as flies in rotting meat , which give birth to maggots every time the wind blows .
Is she dead , then ?
When I reach the place he's calling from , he disappears .
He who survives this day and lives to see old age shall yearly entertain his neighbors on the eve , saying , "Tomorrow is
Oh , madam , madam , madam !
And in public too .
But things have changed there , and it's easier for them on the road now .
Won't the dawn come from here ?
Tell me , is your tardy master close at hand ?
My love , my life , my soul , beautiful Helena !
It looks like a day when the sun is hidden .
We'll watch a whole play tomorrow .
I had planned to celebrate it quietly , but since my lord is once more himself , I will be Cleopatra again .
Thank you very much .
The prince has done neither ; therefore , in my opinion , he isn't really protected by sanctuary .
And he's rubbed himself with perfume .
What ?
She shall not .
I'll take all who served Brutus into my service .
After a little while , I'll beat him too .
How are you , my love ? , Demetrius and Egeus , come with us .
Your case is most unusual , though the Venetian law can't stop you from proceeding. , Yes , so he says .
When you are gentle , you shall have one , too , and not till then .
If we crown him , I have to admit we'd be giving him the power to do damage .
I can't admit that , since you'd have to compare his excellence to mine .
What are you saying ?
Believe me , King of Illusions , I made a mistake .
This must be some kind of fairyland .
Let me have it now .
What , is the man insane ?
Don't get wound up , my good man .
The law fully authorizes the penalty , which you have to pay according to the contract .
Take care of the queen !
The messenger arrived on my watch and is unloading his mules at your tent .
We will go in together .
You mustn't hold my earlier outburst against me .
I won't exhaust you anymore with idle chitchat .
The moral of this story is that it's not enough to speak ; you have to speak grammatically .
We're off to eat and whoop it up at your father's house .
of her father .
Now , welcome , Kate. , And let everyone bear witness that here I kiss her as my sovereign queen .
You who are so skilled in cursing , stay awhile and teach me how to curse my enemies .
You mean , to bear me , not to bear My protector , Richard , insists on it .
I saw Othello's true face when I saw his mind .
Are you a god , an angel , or a devil , that you make my blood turn cold and my hair stand up ?
I couldn't bear to obey all of your daughters ' harsh orders .
Tell me right now and stop fooling : where's the money ?
A constant pain to me !
May I only do well in these dangerous battles if my intention to repent and prosper is sincere !
No , not sure ones when we're talking about something unsure .
No faithful subject ever rejoiced more at the discovery of most dangerous treason than I now rejoice that I was thwarted in a damnable undertaking .
Yes , leeks are good .
Performing is activity , and he is always doing that .
We're still waiting for one more .
Good sir , stay close to me .
Has he taken care of the music ?
Then I guess I was misled .
From now on I will , cousin , and I'll think of all kinds of games for us .
And he's friendly with Caesar .
That will please God , who has him now .
Tranio , let's go .
Do you understand what I'm saying , man ?
Kneel , Romans , kneel , and let's wash our hands , up to the elbows , in Caesar's blood and smear it on our swords .
Talk makes him crazy .
But no more spooky visions ! , Where are the messengers ?
If you think about it correctly , Caesar has suffered a great wrong .
Cowards die many times before their deaths .
As I vowed , I will unite the York and Lancaster families .
My lord ?
She's alive .
In just an hour from now , Duchess of York , I'll be saluting you as the mother of two beautiful queens .
Neither of them would take anything but the two rings .
He's made me a Christian .
And if anything important happens , find me and let me know .
You have enough holy feeling to advise me to "make peace with God , " but you're willing to go to war with God by murdering me ?
Are your doors locked ?
While he was alive , I lived only to serve him and oppose his enemies .
If I live through this , I'll be good to you .
Or should I say it's her uncle ?
Get out of here , good Fleance , run , run , run !
My eyesight has always been bad .
Why is that ?
When they see the face of Caesar , they will vanish .
He's not sick , my lord , but he's very upset , and his problems are serious .
But since you're his scoundrel servant , I will .
It is .
I don't think so !
A snail ?
I saw him holding the handkerchief !
If her breath steams up the glass , then she's alive .
My cousin means Signior Benedick of Padua .
And when she was here recently she flirted with Edmund and gave him significant glances .
Have you written that down , that they aren't criminals ?
It's bad news when a country is ruled by a child .
Don't say anything bad about wine anymore .
If you do intend to live , then mourn .
Civil wounds now can heal , and peace can live again .
He has brought you figs .
You're not supposed to get old until you're wise .
No , I'm as honest as I am Christian .
Later , in a better world than this , I'd love to get to know you .
That's why I praise myself , who , if I do say so myself , is quite praiseworthy .
That's what's driving her crazy .
The point is that she didn't write this letter .
Though I wouldn't wish to be better for my own sake , for your sake I wish I were twenty times more than myself , a thousand times more beautiful and ten thousand times richer , just so you might value me more , so my good qualities , beauty , possessions , and friends would be more than you could calculate .
Do whatever you want , and I'll say your insults are just a bad mood .
And when I told you he was involved the whole time I was trying to get Desdemona , you were like , "Oh , really ? " And then you frowned and wrinkled up your forehead as if you were imagining something horrible .
I found it in my room , and Iago just confessed that he put it there for his own purposes .
You see that any morals she has left are preventing her from denying the charges : she doesn't want to add perjury to her list of sins .
First let me talk with this philosopher here. ,
Could you really do such a thing , for all the world ?
Three of the carriages are very imaginatively designed , and they match the fencing accessories .
Go to Adriana , you scoundrel , and quickly .
I had to hurry to my love , beautiful Helena , who lights up the night better than all those fiery stars .
Yes , my good lord .
When they're endangered , I save them .
From my kind uncle , who I know will give it to me , especially as it's not worth much .
Take a few steps , I want to see you walk .
Where are you hiding ?
The king has strictly forbidden it .
Demetrius doesn't think so , and that's all that matters .
Shouldn't I say , "Does a dog have money ?
It's good we're doing this .
Your brothers ?
Oh , ceremony , only show me your value !
Draw your sword , scoundrel .
How could it be wisdom !
Oh , Cassius , I'll run far from this country to where no Romans can find me .
Alas , my lord , your confidence is getting the better of your wisdom .
Ah , my good old friends !
To have seen much but own nothing is to have rich eyes and poor hands .
Antony , it's time to stop your wild hedonism .
Please !
It's my birthday .
I'll do anything you ask .
You ass !
What , you mean kid actors ?
You're right .
What kind of crude jerk are you ?
If he is , that's his problem .
Okay , but please not before me .
Here he comes .
You mean this is the whole problem , that she is shy and hasn't said everything she means to say and do ? , My lord of Burgundy , what do you have to say to this lady ?
Please let her speak .
I hope you're right .
Do you dare kill a friend of mine ?
I'll stay , my lord .
March to the bridge .
Good sir , as a friend , I advise you to leave this place .
He sent a messenger ahead of him who arrived here so out of breath that he could barely speak his message .
My uncle the king is to blame for this .
To Adriana ?
Caesar !
I don't even know you .
This is some monster of the island , with four legs , who seems to me to have some kind of ache .
If we take away Caesar's support , he'll have to come back down to earth ; otherwise , he'll fly too high and keep the rest of us in a state of fear and obedience .
My heart's too sad for long goodbyes .
My lord , welcome this man .
You have all served me well , and kings are your peers .
I'm not a doddering old fool who brags about the things he did when he was young , and what he would do now if he weren't so old .
I never saw you before in my life .
Don't insult me with your distrust .
Then I hope night shadows your day , and death takes your life !
First of all , Pyramus has to take out a sword to kill himself , which the ladies in the audience won't be able to stand .
Oh , excellent !
No doubt , no doubt .
And why does Lysander deny that he loves you , when he loves you so deeply ?
On my life I swear to you that your youngest daughter doesn't love you least .
I was just knocking to see if anyone was home .
Terrible .
The man that once sold the skin of a lion while the beast still lived died hunting him .
I think I did , sir .
Nine or ten times I wanted to stab him under the ribs .
Watch over Signior Leonato's house ; with the wedding being held there tomorrow , there's a great to-do there tonight .
It's not manly .
Our friends are all waiting for you .
That was a humorous message .
Yes .
My library was a large enough dukedom for me .
Your whole family will be ruined .
Your Majesty didn't present yourself as the king .
We owe you love and service forever .
Yes , it's William , sir .
Don't do it , sir .
What did he do to you ?
Lead the way .
Go , take your sweetheart and leave him to me .
It's so simple !
The armies have merely changed places , Titinius , because Octavius has been overthrown by noble Brutus's forces at the very moment that Antony overthrew Cassius's legions .
Besides , they act as outward consciences and preachers to us all , a visible reminder that we should prepare ourselves for death .
And you , And how are you liking the shepherd's life , Master Touchstone ?
What about Stanley ?
Yes , and that's surprising , because lovers are usually early .
Lead us , monster ; we'll follow .
I hope things go well there .
I'm an ass , I'm a woman's servant , and I'm beside myself .
Sirs , never mind .
Your head , my lord ?
Good morning , Richmond .
Oh , sin can disguise itself so artfully !
Husband , I'll eat with you in private today and hear your confession about all the pranks you've pulled .
Just a minute ago I heard you say you didn't like it when Cassio left my wife .
Maybe until after Theseus's wedding day .
I'll sleep over here .
Here it is .
Please , let me go .
And now you claim you gave it to a judge's clerk !
Stay in your cabins .
If that man , who's made up of conflicts , becomes musical , then there must be something wrong with the universe .
We can't think that way about what we did .
Where is he staying ?
I hereby declare we will have no more marriage .
Yes , that's my husband's name .
If a ship's leaving , come to the marketplace .
My brother thinks highly of you , and because of his affection , has helped arrange your marriage , but that was definitely a waste of his time and energy .
But all of you , remember what you've said and prove yourselves true Romans .
But don't do that .
You're too bitter .
If you dare to fight today , come to the field .
How are you , sir ?
That these crimes are punished so quickly is proof .
You and he are both welcome , sir .
If he doesn't like it , he can go live with my sister .
Everything's ready .
If I said something , she'd mock me so mercilessly that I'd probably disintegrate into air .
What work can you do ?
If her breath were as terrible as her words , she would kill every living thing from here to the furthest star .
Is that you , Iago ?
And don't be proud .
Then there must be no lovers in the forest , either , because they're as good as a clock , marking the lazy foot of time with a sigh every minute and a groan every hour .
What crimes have you committed to be sent here to this prison ?
Caesar , you thought this would happen .
Yes , heavily .
This , this All-Souls ' day , is my just desserts .
I'll answer for everything .
If she is , you can sue me for lying to you .
Come shake hands with Laertes , Hamlet .
If he hadn't , we'd all be embarrassed to look at him .
She's not going to borrow money from them .
But I'll see you soon .
You are welcome here , my friends .
So far I've done exactly what I was supposed to do , I put the love potion on an Athenian's eyes .
Here I am at your service , my dear lord .
Leave out the water .
Let's go forth , dear countrymen .
Yes , my lord .
Can't he pay back the money ?
If we meet again , then we'll smile .
Come on , please sing .
No , my dear , you were a little angel who kept me going .
Could that be a lawyer's skull ?
Where's the necklace ?
Maybe we can benefit from the same chaos that has defeated us .
You know , if you were anyone other than Brutus , that speech would be your last .
Can a good thing hide itself ?
But sir , Be quiet , Kent .
This is our station .
Every subject's duty is the king's , but every subject's soul is his own .
Yes , really .
Get somebody strong to carry him out of here .
They sit chatting by the parlor fire .
I think they do .
Is everything ready for that event ?
Your royal father is murdered .
Oh , Caesar , this Charmian lived until a moment ago .
May He bless you , too .
Get up , liar .
Oh , don't touch me .
Or stuff what he says into their pockets .
Then , at my farm I have a hundred milk cows , a hundred and twenty fat oxen in my stables , and all the equipment necessary to maintain them .
He's made me a little sore , I'll admit .
Be Conrade !
Den it shall also content me .
Saw who ?
Oh , he's a dangerously clever boy , bold , quick-witted , capable .
It might happen that these strange signs , the unusual terror of this night , and the urgings of his fortune-tellers will keep him away from the Capitol today .
No flattery for him , no sir !
The duke will agree with me on that .
I didn't think you could even be so angry .
And is "pig" not the same as "great , " may I ask ?
He is definitely not there , sir .
No , it's permanent .
But Count Claudio can stay , for what I'm about to say concerns him .
And even if they don't , at least Hero's supposed death will stop the rumors of her infidelity .
But both of these were put off by Elizabeth Grey , a careworn mother of many children who had once been a beauty but was now a stressed-out widow long past her prime .
What do you say , Signior Gremio ?
We will watch the execution .
The Venetians are waiting for their food .
I'm a soldier , more experienced than you , and better able to give orders .
Should we see what he thinks ?
Mine too. , Are you listening , monster ?
If he's not in love with a woman , then you can't trust the usual symptoms .
Whichever hand literally stabbed their tender hearts , you're the one who gave the order .
Be quiet !
I won't listen to you .
He's too good to have any compassion for you .
But we can talk more about that tomorrow , when we'll discuss matters of state that concern us both .
How are you ?
I'm as good a gentleman as the emperor .
Follow and see to it that nothing serious happens between them .
Right now ?
What , an argument already ?
I know a lady in Venice who'd walk all the way to Palestine for a kiss from him .
But I spoke with someone who saw Cawdor die , and he said that Cawdor openly confessed his treasons , begged your highness's forgiveness , and repented deeply .
Antony would easily outshine all imaginary beings .
How is my wife ?
What's that noise ?
He did , and he snatched my ring right off my finger .
Lend me your cloak , Sir Thomas .
Sister , be happy in my unhappiness. , Sir , I will humbly obey you .
However your wit and luck allow .
Relent ?
My sweet darling cries when she sees me work and tells me that such a wonderful man never performed such lowly tasks before .
You said it right , old mole .
She fainted at the sight of them bleeding .
Well , let's move on to our work with the living .
I'll give you the most expensive ring in Venice , and I'll make a public announcement to help me find it .
At least it's possible in Denmark .
Yes indeed it is , sir .
You , I think , would best know what he's thinking .
There's been a whole debate on the topic .
I see the downfall of my family .
You want me to say what I'm thinking ?
It was a good and lucky vision .
What have you done ?
It's the death of half the world .
An era of universal peace is about to start .
Yes , we should get his support , for his mature presence will make others think well of us and speak out in support of our actions .
His lips were nice and red , a little more lively and passionate than the red that was in his cheeks , one was pure red and the other more pink .
He says that for Brutus's sake he finds himself indebted to us all .
I've never seen the waters so disturbed .
Sweetheart , go on .
Oh , Antony , don't beg us to kill you .
Still the same old Cassius !
And , moreover , God saw Benedick when he was hid in the garden .
I'm glad Casca is with us .
Wait , let me hire him too. , Here's my fool's cap , a token of my gratitude .
We have not yet set the coronation day .
Let's stay and hear the will !
Not really , for the truest poetry is often the most artificial .
You imply that married men are fools .
He's staying in the forest with your father now .
How is your Highness ?
A guy like that is bigger than an ape , but the ape could be his doctor , it's so much smarter .
He's dead .
Do you see this sweet sight ?
That's right , uncle , talk to your heart , like the Good morning to you both .
Are you good or evil ?
Until that happens , let me be who I am and don't try to change me .
Don't say anything else .
You , my earthly moon , are now eclipsed , and that alone foretells my ruin .
That's enough .
Well , we'll speak more soon .
And now , let's turn to our business with the French .
Let the world collapse around us .
What are you reading , teacher ?
This is all quite pleasant .
You must know that the snake will act according to his nature .
Niece , you are exceptionally perceptive .
Then the two of them will both pursue one girl .
My friends , remember that you're my guests here .
And when he laughs , Othello will go crazy .
Octavia weeps at the thought of leaving Rome .
Where is kind Hastings ?
I think he's got the money .
Don't worry , Baptista , you'll be perfectly satisfied .
If she admits she wanted this , then I won't blame Othello. , Come here , my child .
Oh God , whose side I think I'm fighting on , look kindly on my forces .
I'll put on some poor and ragged clothes and smudge my face with dirt .
Look , if you love me , stay .
I accept with thanks , Enobarbus .
I used to be the man in the moon a long time ago .
It takes a wise father to know his own child .
Where is your army , then , to beat him back ?
You're mistaken about all that .
This is all that's left for me to do , but I won't do it .
The queen is dead , my lord .
If he stays in this country he'll be found .
If I were Brutus now and Brutus were me , I wouldn't have let him influence me .
No , not a chance .
That's not good .
Yes , indeed , bring them before me .
With her , on top of her , however you want to say it .
Let's hear it .
I swear I'm not lying .
Very nice to see you , sir .
It's time for me to say goodbye to you .
There was no limit to what his lustful eye and savage heart would prey on .
And pay attention to what Caesar does and which men are close to him .
Beatrice , I swear , I'm going .
There's something else to be done .
Renowned duke , please join us in the abbey , where we will discuss at length all that has happened to us .
He's changed a great deal .
You stupid cop , stop your violence !
Look , sir , I'm bleeding .
You sound like a cattle dealer : that's the way they sell bulls .
Thank you , madam .
You just said they had to face her .
Good-bye , sir .
Yawn , snore .
We didn't please them on land .
I repeat , spread the rumor that Anne , my wife , is sick and likely to die .
But she has had prayers read for her and is dressed up like a pure virgin , with flowers tossed on her grave and the bell tolling for her .
She had a premonition of what has actually happened .
Anything your Highness suffered in that disguise , I beg you to see it as your own fault and not mine , because if you'd been what I took you for , there would have been no offense .
Indulge us further and supplement our performance with your own imaginings .
Only yesterday the word of Caesar might have stood against the world .
When was there ever before so great a loss on one side and so little on the other , in the ordinary and equal clash of battle ?
Oh , I only wish I knew the name of that husband you said he predicted will have a cheating wife !
My good friends , I'll see you tomorrow .
What , are you moaning on about your toothache ?
And who is that ?
It's hell in our house , and you helped cheer it up , like a funny devil .
I'll come at you with the old proverb : "Should I make myself at home ? "
She provides an excellent moral .
What do you mean by that ?
Take that , and that !
This strong poison's overpowering me .
Oh , my good master !
Oh , she could sing a wild bear to sleep !
Can I have a word with you privately ?
Othello , I've been seriously hurt .
Is this the work of an ambitious man ?
This means we're having some mischievous fun .
I've heard that's not the most nourishing food .
Why does it matter that I'm not as lucky or lovable as you are and that the love I feel is unrequited ?
I tell you , they are not honest men .
I did too , and he also swore he would marry her tonight .
Tell us , Bottom .
I can't offer her more than all I have .
What do you say ?
We'll start a fire .
That's very sensible , but you missed my sense : I meant Hortensio is afraid of you .
Why , he won't wake up till Judgment Day .
Good night , brother .
And is everyone who swears and lies a traitor ?
So you're admitting Clarence , my father , is dead .
It's obvious to everyone that you've tricked her , drugged her , or kidnapped her .
Sir , sir !
Yes , they are .
So what's the story , old boy ?
He loves to hear me tell him how men can be snared by flatterers , just like unicorns can be captured in trees , elephants in holes , and lions with nets .
You get only one round .
I'm Christopher Sly , son of old Sly of Barton-on-Heath , a peddler by birth , a Oh , this is why your poor wife is mourning !
Brutus , do not provoke me .
Signior Benedick served well in the war , my lady .
Is he dead ?
Your delicacies aren't worth as much to me as your welcome is .
The sight made me so sick I couldn't watch any more .
I think I see a friend who will pay my bail and save my life .
Oh , don't injure your cousin like that !
He was happy here , listening to a song .
Read your history !
It is not the custom for the maids in France to kiss before they are married , is that what she says ?
Biondello , go and tell your mistress to come to me .
What , is he dead ?
We have to take the king's side .
In that case it's good to be a post .
Who do you think you are , keeping me out of my own house ?
I'm going now .
Ask him to go in .
Nice Grumio , bring me some .
To prison , until you're called into court .
You good-for-nothing , let me in .
Where's lady Portia ?
I don't know what you and other men think of this life , but as for me , I'd rather not live at all than live to worship a man as ordinary as myself .
You're not as close to death as you think you are .
I'd rather adopt a child than have one of my own. , Come here , Moor .
Dromio , what stuff of mine did you put on a ship ?
The nine Muses mourning the death of learning and scholarship." That's some sharp , critical satire , and it's not appropriate for a wedding .
I hope she keeps it short .
Ratcliffe , my lord , it's me .
Don't keep anything back , I insist .
You sent for me , sir ?
I have thousands of logs to take away and pile up , on strict orders from him .
Please , Signior Gremio .
What happened , sir ?
Strike !
Please go to him , my friend .
Yes , we are .
Bassanio told him he'd try to hurry back .
I hope not , Madam .
Tell the constable that .
Come on , brother !
Well , Syracusian , tell us-briefly-why you left your hometown and came to Ephesus .
You haven't seen him since ?
I will .
I'd rather cut my tongue out of my mouth than say anything bad about Michael Cassio .
Forgive us , my lord .
Come , my sweet Kate .
I'll bet my life you gave some woman the ring !
The king is insane .
If not , come when you have the courage .
No , he just gets reality completely wrong .
Go to the platform , Brutus .
Look , they're crying .
Maybe ?
Something's wrong .
Murder's always horrible , but this one was especially horrible , weird , and unnatural .
Pull off my beard ?
I'm a gentleman , sir , and my name is Conrade .
His letter will tell you how he's doing .
They couldn't , they wouldn't .
I'll help you through this business .
Beware of jealousy , my lord !
You'll be sorry later , but it'll be too late .
Well , did you think about what I said ?
I beg you , remember the good work I've done for you , and how I've never lied to you , never made mistakes , and never grumbled in my work .
I wish he'd go away !
We know you have a job to do , Brakenbury , and we'll do what you say .
The father and the master and the king didn't order their subordinates ' deaths when they ordered their services .
Please , sir , I beg you .
This letter is for you from Signor Antonio .
I wander everywhere faster than the moon revolves around the Earth .
Caesar was a tyrant .
If I ever have to ask you for something that will put your luck to the test , it'll be something difficult and terrible .
God be with you and keep you , and may he heal your head .
Come away with me .
He will be fooled into thinking he is greater than fate , he will mock death , and he will think he is above wisdom , grace , and fear .
Yes sir , I'm fairly witty .
It's probably some noble gentleman stopping off in mid-journey , thinking to spend the night here .
Calphurnia cried out three times in her sleep , "Help , someone !
But listen to me ; let me guide you .
Caesar , you're not going to be killed by a traitor , unless you kill yourself..
In short , I'm not .
Please , go away .
Malcolm and Donalbain , the king's two sons , have run away and fled , which makes them the prime suspects .
You're not answering my question .
Oh , goodbye to my peace of mind !
There's Dolabella , who was sent from Caesar .
Damned Iago !
Who's calling ?
Good spirit !
Orlando , my lord , the youngest son of Sir Rowland de Boys .
For standing up for this unpopular king .
If we can not defend our country with three times such a power left at home , then we deserve to be harassed by an invader and lose our reputation as a powerful and politically savvy nation .
Look , sir .
I remember you took the throne from your brother Prospero .
Oh , my brave Emperor , this is what I call a fight !
Let me tell
Are you headed to the Tower ?
I won't stand for it .
Come on , come on .
I'm happy to say "amen" to that !
There's a knocking at the gate .
In England this strange monster would be just like a man .
Strategy makes a better soldier than haste .
Don't imagine that I'll ever allow myself to return to Rome in chains .
I'll be obedient and do all my tasks without complaining .
Pain , yes indeed .
Musicians , play us a song. , Prince , you look sad .
These two Antipholuses , who look so alike , and these two Dromios , who seem to have the same face , and her story of being shipwrecked , why , these two are the parents of these children and have been reunited by accident .
As I came down ?
You can be married tomorrow if you want .
This forest doesn't seem deserted when you're here , because you are all the world to me .
And just try to remember a few rules of life .
Please come closer. , Make the music louder , please !
It's true .
Nonsense !
Love is such a violent emotion that it makes people self-destruct , as much as any strong emotion .
I knew there would be a masquerade when I got that bad omen of a bloody nose last Easter Monday , at six in the morning , four years after I got the same kind of bloody nose on Ash Wednesday , in the afternoon .
My ships will come home a month before the money is due .
There's only one body here .
Let's do that , Lysander .
When your mind is at peace , your body is sensitive to the elements .
Get to it , be lustful , sleep around , I need soldiers for my army .
All right then , back home we go .
Why , what are you afraid of ?
So I'll stay here for a while .
I have forgotten your name , but you were well cast in the role and played it convincingly .
Oh , you devil , you devil !
So take for life a fellow of pure and plain faithfulness .
Yes , my lord , but I can spoil it .
No thanks , my good mother .
Along the way , I'll find an opportunity to separate him from the queen's proud relatives , as step one in the plan we've discussed .
If you remember your life before you came here , you may also remember how you got here .
So then , you must think that hairy men are honest and simpleminded .
If I could shoot lightning bolts from my eyes , I can tell you who'd be on the ground .
Not really , unless you were ugly .
Our business now is mourning and grief .
The glowworm's light is beginning to fade , so morning is near .
What an ogre you are to slander someone you don't know , and who doesn't know you !
Read the will .
I beg you to tell me your name so I can use it in my prayers .
Oh , Fate , come , come to me , with hands as pale as milk .
Will you please make this half-devil say why he tricked me and damned my soul ?
Do you really think there's a man fool enough to marry into hell , however rich the father is ?
Thank you , I'm sure .
Is it them ?
But if you'd be willing to shoot another arrow the same way you shot the first , I'll watch your arrow more carefully this time .
Shall I come down ?
I've seen you bait and mock this man more than once .
Was Queen Cordelia aggrieved by the letters you delivered ?
I'd rather be a slave or a packhorse for this hateful stablehand here .
I hope God keeps that monster from growing in Othello's mind !
Do you doubt I'll write ?
Then why am I worried ?
Everything we've heard is bad .
Have you snuck over here to watch the wrestling ?
You have to stop talking like this .
All right , we'll have a prologue then .
If you married my sister for her wealth , then for her wealth's sake , treat her with more kindness .
Kind gentlemen , I won't forget the trouble you've taken for me whenever I think of this day .
Every second you delay is as long and dull as a journey to South Seas .
With who ?
Even if I had a whole bunch of mouths , I wouldn't be able to answer that .
Let Caesar do whatever he wants .
First , you have to speak to the watchmen who accused them .
Must I bite ?
Yes , and a brave one , who dares to look at something that would frighten the devil .
When I've revealed my true identity , you'll be glad you took the time to help me out .
Take this , too .
I'll never see my gold again .
He writes brave poems , speaks brave words , makes brave promises , and then breaks them just as bravely .
We didn't expect Mark Antony to be here .
I know how his mind works .
Your preparation for war sounds like something .
And if your clothes were as thin as mine , you'd really feel the air .
Yes , on his front .
Ever since these deadly conflicts erupted between your violent countrymen and ours , both you Syracusians and we Ephesians have held serious councils and decided not to permit any travel between our two hostile towns .
When I like the way you look , for God forbid your face be as ugly as your mask !
Hang on a second .
When you were wooing Desdemona , did Michael Cassio know about it ?
I assure you it is , madam .
Demand .
Please , hurry up .
I'll arrest him .
Look who's here !
Thank you for all your efforts .
Isn't my vest just as clean and fresh as the day I put it on ?
How dare you try to be my friend when you refuse to fight my enemy .
With whom ?
Hurry , Messala , and I'll look for Pindarus in the meantime .
Cupid , that blind bastard son of Venus , conceived from a thought and anger , born from insanity , that blind , naughty boy who makes everyone else go blind just because he can't see himself , let Cupid judge how deep my love runs .
Again !
The wind is right and it's high tide , and I've delayed him a long time already .
Nice to see you .
Well , brighter lights always dim the smaller ones .
Yes , sir .
Forgive me , your grace .
I didn't hear anything .
Oh , it's horrible of her .
We'll see , won't we ?
Why didn't they just kill us that night ?
The chicken is burning , the pig is overcooked , the clock has already struck twelve , and my mistress has clocked me one on the cheek .
In our case , our bad neighbors over their make us early risers , a healthy and sensible thing to be .
For the favor of sleeping in her bed .
I say my prayers out loud .
Control yourself , my precious Queen , and concede that my love is true .
I'm sure I'll never get married in the way my sisters say they're married , loving their father only .
I'll recite something for you , guy .
Yes , ma'am , we have .
Excuse me , sir ?
Tell me , you villainous lowlife , where are my children ?
My mistress showed me you in the moon and your dog and your bush .
Knock at the gate ?
I did that and more , which brings me to the point of this second meeting .
Why , sweet Othello , I haven't done anything to deserve this !
Watch out , Ophelia .
You're my true and honorable wife , as dear to me as the blood that runs through my sad heart .
If I die before you do make sure I'm wrapped in those sheets in my coffin .
Very impressive .
He who chooses me will get as much as he deserves." As much as he deserves , wait a minute there , Morocco , and consider your own value with a level head .
I hope you remember that I said all this because I love you .
Go to him , petition him .
Go to sleep , and I will wrap my arms around you .
I'll write down what she says , so I'll remember it better .
Speak , speak .
A god of a god ?
Oh , my handsome nephew , I must not say that .
I didn't accuse you of lying .
I'll get some cloth and egg whites to bandage his bleeding face .
But listen , if
There's your boyfriend , sleeping right over there .
You've pierced me through the heart with your cruelty , and yet you , the murderer , look as bright and clear as a star in the sky .
But did you see them dead ?
Then certain ones .
If there's anything more sorrowful left to add , keep it to yourself .
Help , help , oh , help !
I only want idiots following my advice , the advice of a fool .
Now , good-bye .
I think this country is so kind that if it weren't for
I will fight him there .
I did not kill your husband .
All this excitement has made the time fly by .
Will he tell us what that pantomime meant ?
If we lose this battle , this is the last time we'll speak to each other .
Well , my good fellows , wait on me tonight .
Today he fought as though he were a god who hated mankind .
It's a lie , you thread , you thimble , you measurement !
Ha !
God knows why , but your mother and your brother have taken sanctuary in Westminster Abbey .
And when she is peevish and perverse , sullen , sour , and disobedient to his honest wishes , what is she but a loathsome , warlike rebel and an ungrateful traitor to her loving lord ?
And she's loyal , as she has proven .
Who wouldn't get sad thinking about things like that ?
He has a very gloomy attitude .
I don't remember .
And even though you know I'm very close to the Prince and Claudio , I swear I'll keep your counsel and deal with this secretly and justly .
Baptista is a noble gentleman , one to whom my father is not completely unknown , and lovely as his daughter is , she is entitled to any number of suitors , myself among them .
Don't cry , don't cry .
The Lord Mayor is knocking .
And I am your Rosalind .
That's completely beside the point .
No other grave on earth shall hold a pair this famous .
There were no primary ones .
I don't like your faults .
I see you've met with the jeweler .
I will go straight to visit him .
Gloucester's eyes ?
Is the king leaving here today ?
Isn't my name Hero ?
Caius Ligarius , I was never your enemy so much as the sickness that's made you so thin .
Let's go to this great feast .
Mine too , to join hers .
Which one of you is Beatrice ?
Hail , King of Scotland !
Don't sleep so close to me .
I'm at your service .
Traveling from Sardis , two mighty eagles fell on our front flag and perched there , eating from the hands of the soldiers who'd accompanied us to Philippi .
What is my nation ?
I tell you , you would find the rituals of war and , I promise you , its ceremonies and its solicitudes and its forms and its gravity and its discipline all to be quite counter to all this noise .
Yes , kind sister .
What else did you hear ?
Are you joking ?
Honestly , sir , we say that we are not criminals .
I hope Antonio repays his loan on time , or he'll suffer for this .
I love him dearly , and I shall continue to favor him .
Do you get what I'm saying , Reynaldo ?
Come on .
What are we going to do , Enobarbus ?
As wicked as I am , they were slaughtered because of me , not because of anything they did .
Yes , she's young and tender .
When you have said your lines , go hide in that bush. , Everyone else , go there too when you're not onstage .
I humbly thank you .
Listen to me , because I'm older than you , surely .
What's your name ?
Meet with the ambassadors .
Will it never be morning ?
Of course I will .
Well , then , what are you messing up ?
Oh my Christian ducats !
Goodbye .
Who are these men ?
Goodbye , then .
You can have it then , your highness .
Are you going to Scone ?
That Don John had given him a thousand pieces of gold for wrongfully accusing the Lady Hero .
Whenever I mention him , praise him more than any man deserves .
I haven't seen anything .
I know what you'd do .
You're leaving with my tongue in your tail ?
Your highness , could you send me on a mission to the ends of the earth ?
It's sad , but Iago knows she had sex with Cassio a thousand times .
Antony will go where his passion is .
The less they deserve , the more your generosity is worth .
Oh , he's good at bending words around !
I was killed in the Capitol .
I humbly say goodbye .
How is it , my husband , oh , how is it , that you have become a stranger to yourself ?
You look angry .
Who brought it out here ?
God and your work be praised , victorious friends .
It's almost fairy time .
Caesar , what did my stay in Egypt have to do with you ?
Do you think Alexander the Great looked like this when he was buried ?
We've all been duped .
Well , to wear out their shoes and get myself more work .
Three thousand ducats , hmmm .
I must join the duke for lunch .
But what's this I see ?
He's not sleeping to fatten up his lazy body , but praying , to nourish his attentive soul .
Here he comes , my lord .
It was just moments ago .
We know how much they suffer if we are unkind to them .
Don't be offended .
No , don't .
But please tell me , who's his best friend ?
Come down .
How are things now ?
You'll have to woo Bianca like the rest .
You scoundrel !
He's recruited Bocchus , the King of Libya ; Archelaus of Cappadocia ; Philadelphos , King of Paphlagonia ; the Thracian king , Adallas ; King Manchus of Arabia ; the King of Pont ; Herod , of Judea ; Mithridates , King of Comagen ; Polemon and Amyntas , the kings of Mede and Lycaonia , and many more .
It'll be my job to talk about how Benedick is sick with love for Beatrice .
Is that enough of an answer ?
You'll see shortly how the murderer wins the love of Gonzago's wife .
Ha , ha , ha !
Then my love is humble .
A servant told me the night-watchmen saw horrid sights too , but different ones from what we heard and saw .
I'm glad .
Bow to him , fairies , and curtsy to him .
And now it looks like you need my help .
Because who is this man they follow ?
Oh , Pomfret , Pomfret !
No one shows mercy because he has to .
I wouldn't do that for the whole wide world .
The heavens are being stingy with their light .
You take out your sword too .
Just a minute ago I was the owner of this beautiful mansion , master of these servants , and queen over myself .
Other than Richard , even those whom we fight against would rather we won .
Then tell her my loving story in simple terms .
Since you're giving me new assignments , let me remind you what you promised me but haven't come through with yet .
It's our destiny , like death .
Good afternoon , good gentleman .
You've offered an excellent interpretation .
Well , should we hear some music ?
Amen .
You're Forgive me , Signior Gremio , but I'm anxious to get things moving .
I'm ready to suffer peacefully whatever he does to me in his cruelty and anger .
You may as well undertake to be hanged .
Tomorrow , I'll let you know what I've decided and what answer you should deliver to the king of England .
He rejected my authority as much as yours .
Go on , master , and I will follow you , with truth and loyalty to my last breath .
Where's my fool ? , Go call my fool and have him come here .
Yes , but the mustard is probably too hot .
You slander her , you devil .
This lantern represents the moon .
He hasn't arrived yet .
We've advanced too far .
Men act imprudently sometimes , then realize their mistakes when they have time to think about them .
How are you and your master getting along ?
Please do .
Ah , there's the problem .
Duke Solinus , my husband , and both my children , and you two Dromios , who marked the day of my sons ' births with your own , come into the abbey with me for a new christening .
Eros , can you still see me ?
They killed your wife , your children , your servants , anyone they could find .
He'd be quite a monster if his eyes were in his tail .
Why aren't the leaves withering now that the sap is all dried up ?
Just listen a little more , and I'll bring you up to date about the present situation , which is the whole reason I'm telling you this story in the first place .
Do you remember her face ?
Teach me how I should think and speak .
As for the food , it will be served in covered dishes .
And I have met a gentleman who promises to help me find a good music tutor to instruct our lady love .
Plain and simple loyalty doesn't make anyone act phony .
Tell me , Voltemand , what's the news from the king of Norway ?
Why , who's so stupid that he can't see through this fraud ?
Yes , let's do that .
Tyrrel , come back shortly after dinner and tell me the details of their deaths .
Read it instantly .
Pretend that you're standing on the shore , watching a city dance on the shifting waves , and you'll have an idea of the look of this majestic fleet as it holds a straight course for Harfleur .
Speak softly .
Love can make worthless things beautiful .
What power can rein in promiscuous evil once it's gotten rolling ?
But surely you're not planning to
I think someone's coming from Venice .
Then it's no surprise they had a bad influence on him .
You bastard !
I know how they think , and I understand why they're doing this .
And so do I. I think we all do .
And when she speaks , doesn't her voice stir up passion ?
Are you talking about Caesar ?
You are a remarkable person and your loss is equally remarkable .
Yes , like that .
Even the goddess of patience couldn't look at this and be patient , it's too horrifying !
Show us the way , sir .
Besides , our hands are hard and calloused .
Don't trust rotten planks .
Get out of my sight !
Jesus , let's kill him !
But if you die before I return , you'll have made a mockery of my efforts .
You sound like a pack of wolves howling at the moon .
I know the burden of hosting him is both an honor and a trouble , but that doesn't mean it's not a trouble just the same .
Hello , beautiful Helena !
Yes , and I'll keep crying a while longer .
This is what happens when you act rashly .
In God's name , speak .
Here comes another Jew .
I must go attend Caesar .
Ask it something , Horatio .
Well , do your best .
Which ones are the malefactors ?
I didn't love you .
I beg you to pardon me .
No .
And so do I , my lord .
Did you hear that ?
Why did I ever have one ?
Will you be here when I return ?
What do you think , Norfolk ?
Where is he ?
The more she
We'll hurry .
The queen is here on special business , and her army has moved on .
How can it be ?
Why ,
Grief seems to be contagious , for my eyes , seeing the tears in yours , began to fill .
Curly golden hair moves so nicely in the wind and makes a woman beautiful .
When it's paid , bring your friend back .
Ever since you lost yours .
Don't worry about that .
Yes , madam , that's the one .
You're a fool .
You were sent for .
Oh , Caesar , read mine first , for my petition affects you more directly .
Because my name is George .
I brought you here from Venice .
Listen they're howling .
Robin Starveling , the tailor ?
And now he's gone .
By this sword" is an oath , and oaths must be kept .
They drink Danes under the table , and it takes them no effort at all to out-drink Germans .
While he and I are at one , my loyal servant Catesby will be at the other , so nothing will happen that we won't find out about .
They commanded me to lock my doors and leave you out in this merciless storm , but I've come out here to find you and take you where there's warmth and food .
Women are made for
Here he is .
Well then , if I've ever thanked a man , I'll thank you now .
Do I mistreat even my enemies ?
But quiet .
What , we're going to die ?
his daughter , Katherine , with some insignificant , unprofitable dukedoms as her dowry .
This is the door .
My lord , I will give them all they deserve .
The Lord keep him from the title of king !
Come on and kiss me , Kate .
To Brutus's , to Cassius's , let's burn them all .
How's the queen ?
We heard that once you were served eight wild boars roasted whole for breakfast , for only twelve people !
Didn't I turn down the page where I left off reading ?
Hey , look over there !
Let's go .
Help !
What is it , my lord ?
Madam , we have to go : the Prince , the Count , Signior Benedick , Don John , and all the gentlemen of the town have come to bring you to church .
The human being unburdened by the trappings of civilization is no more than a poor , naked , two-legged animal like you .
Thank you , Ariel .
God protect you from tornadoes , evil stars , and diseases !
I myself , who am more indebted to you than anyone , have brought you this young scholar
He is a gentleman of a good family , and for his ransom , he will give you two hundred crowns .
Lean forward .
No , not at all , sir .
The army is ready .
Damn you for teaching me your language !
Go home , you lazy men .
The only profit I seek is a peaceful match .
Caesar is upset .
I'll die like a swan .
You piece of filth , you're lying !
He said my eyes and my hair were black and , now that I think of it , he scorned me .
That's what her mother always tells me .
Bring him here and ask him .
The sister of my wife , this lady here , is married to your son .
I'll return the favor .
Be silent , or else my magic spell will be broken .
Come , Grey .
Can't help it ?
Whenever a king sighs , everyone groans .
You will seem even brighter and more virtuous when she's out of the picture .
What's this ?
I'll stand guard with you tonight .
Who's that coming over here ?
But it doesn't matter .
No , Kate ?
You have a beautiful half-sister , Octavia .
Queen , you knew very well that my heart was tied to your ship and that you would pull me along with you .
The words expressly specify "a pound of flesh." So take your penalty of a pound of flesh , but if you shed one drop of Christian blood when you cut it , the state of Venice will confiscate your land and property under Venetian law .
We're not saying anything treasonous , man .
Yes .
Oh , what a wonderful son , I can impress my mother !
It's clear , every man must take responsibility for the manner of his own death .
Follow me .
But his investments are uncertain right now .
Captain Jamy is a wonderfully valorous gentleman , that's certain , one with great learning and knowledge concerning ancient warfare , I happen to know from his maneuvers .
Now let the wind blow , waves swell , and ships sink !
Yes it is , you half-blood .
No more of these thoughts .
And like I am for no woman .
Sa , sa , sa , sa .
And how did she react to all this ?
To whom ?
Oh I hope that's not true !
You sing , and I'll dance .
He needs to see you right away .
I can't believe I was scared of him !
You told me she got them , and that she promised to give me a little something in return soon , but nothing like that ever happens .
There's a similar mark on her arm .
Yes , I should know , but it disturbs me .
We have consented to all reasonable terms .
Have my brother-in-law's troops been mobilized ?
If there's any reason we shouldn't get married , I urge you to tell me .
It's born of my A witty mother !
If you don't mind , I need to rest a bit .
So go ahead and have your terrifying fun .
You'll never find her without an answer unless you find her without a tongue .
Come down , brother .
So what do you say to my suit ?
He said that the people weren't used to being spoken to except by the What blocks of wood !
No , I won't give my medicine away to anyone but the sick .
Are you that impatient ?
Get over it .
No , don't hit him , lieutenant !
Let me speak my mind , and I'll rid the world of its sickness , if it will only tolerate my medicine .
But tell me , which of my good qualities first made you suffer love for me ?
Is there anything else I can do for you ?
I will , even if I were king of all kingdoms .
Two of both kinds makes four .
Doesn't my wit suit me well ?
She's talking .
No .
Mistress , both the man and his master are possessed .
Oh , good old man , you're a great example of that old work ethic , where people worked because it was their duty , not just for the money .
Hopefully , your wedding day is only postponed .
Here I am , your slave , a poor , sick , weak , hated old man .
Listen , Clitus .
What you're doing is the way to make her scorn you continually .
I can't ask you to make my daughter live , that's impossible , but I beg you both to tell the people of Messina that she was innocent when she died .
So be it .
You lover of that damned whore , you're talking to me of "ifs" ?
I'll pay you .
Your slander has broken her heart , and now she lies buried with her ancestors in a tomb , ancestors who had never been tainted by scandal until you caused one with your wickedness .
Venice has made Cassio governor here on Cyprus .
I'll poison you , or beat you with a club , or stab you with a sword .
I don't believe it .
Was this ambition ?
Okay , now it starts !
Play , I say !
Explain .
Lead those away who will follow you , and we'll explain publicly the reasons for Caesar's death .
I've got a plan that will fix everything .
Murder ?
What does Lord Stanley say ?
Is supper ready ?
You can't party your way into dukedoms there .
Beat him up .
The wiser the woman , the wilder .
Oh , what a sinful thought !
Sir , your age and status inspire more respect than your weapons do .
Your friends are up and buckling on their armor .
But let it go. , Now , Litio , it's your turn .
I am not in the giving mood today .
Not tonight , Iago .
Pour in the blood of a sow who has eaten her nine offspring .
I know his eyes are worshiping some other woman , or why wouldn't he be here ?
What's the difference ?
Iras , I won't see you again for a long time .
Let's see , how can I
The sweet and bitter fool Will appear right away .
Give me one good reason to think she's cheating on me .
I've told you everything I know .
Make room !
Until I know for sure , I'll humor her .
What are you waiting for , lords of France ?
How can you ever hope for mercy for yourself , when you don't give any now ?
But I made an oath , an oath , an oath in heaven .
Indeed , the French can bet twenty French crowns to one that they'll beat us , they have such an army .
Damn those words , "but yet ! " "But yet" is like a jailer about to bring out some horrible criminal .
Enliven them with yours !
Sir , I know I'm not a flatterer .
Cousins , you all have work to do. , Oh , I beg your pardon .
Step aside .
You , fellow , step out of the crowd .
Damn it !
Thank you , Tubal .
My lord , you know I'm your friend .
Let me come clean .
Why don't you have a seat , your highness ?
I'm not scared of you .
Banquo , if your soul is going to make it to heaven , tonight's the night .
I remember your eyes quite well .
Before I saw Lysander , Athens seemed like paradise to me .
Catesby , fly to the duke .
Send the deed after me and I'll sign it .
A messenger has arrived from Caesar .
Hurry. , Oh , love , if you could only watch the battle today and see how expert I am at my craft .
They're all dead .
You're lying .
Agreed .
Then he says I didn't return some ships he loaned me .
Are you over your ridiculous mood ?
She's too much for me to handle .
Why , what's the problem ?
No , you entertain your suitors with mild and gentle conversation , quiet and pleasant .
Goodbye .
And I regret having bragged to the messenger about how my enemies were being butchered at Pomfret while I , as I said , was in good standing with Richard .
That's how Claudio will respond .
I'll head to France soon .
That's why they say love is a child .
The wolves have finished preying for the night , and look , the gentle dawn is rising , dappling the sleepy eastern sky with spots of light .
Your daughter and son-in-law .
It's time to leave .
They were lusting after each other .
These past fifteen years you have been living in a dream , and even when you were awake , it was as though you slept .
In your own kitchens you act like wildcats .
It was just an accident !
Barnardo's taken my place .
What do you need me to do ?
Sir , we'll follow as soon as Mark Antony kisses Octavia good-bye .
What , is trusting a friend such a crime ?
And leave us , Publius , in case the people storming us should harm you .
Give me what I deserve , and do your duty !
Then one of you will warp and pull away , and there goes your marriage .
I think he must have turned into an animal , because I can't find him anywhere looking like a man .
The man who brought my answer to you was a fool .
Why are you making them work so hard ?
Well , whose is it ?
Now from head to foot I'm as firm as marble .
Excellent in fencing , I mean , sir .
Nobody was hurt in the slightest .
Now you say it was "Knock at the gate" ?
My lord , I don't know what's going on , but it seems to me that your highness isn't being treated as politely as before .
Let go of him , peasant , or you die !
If you let go of your power to attract me , I won't have any power to follow you .
That's for sure .
His body will lie in my tent tonight , with the honorable observance that suits a soldier .
Lord , it's glancing every which way !
Ah , this place is too cold to be hell .
If I come back from the battlefield again to kiss those lips , I'll be covered in blood .
Most royal sir , Fleance has escaped .
What marvelous music !
Why , madam , have I offered you my love only to be flouted in front of the king ?
When we're by ourselves you can call me "Tranio." Everywhere else , address me as your master Lucentio .
His eyes used to glow with pride when he reviewed his troops .
When I tried desperately to question them further , they vanished into thin air .
Check on your daughter , your house , your money !
He will die .
But never mind them , if Caesar had stabbed their mothers , they would've forgiven him .
These kneelings and humble courtesies might excite ordinary men , flattering them into turning Roman law into children's games .
I could swear this is the real Vincentio .
Well , time is the old judge that tries your kind of criminal .
The Moor says the man you hurt is very important in Cyprus , and that under the circumstances he has no choice but to refuse to reinstate you .
But that's another story .
Oh , Iras , Charmian !
Your mother's name has become a threat to her own children .
I took your hands in friendship , but , indeed , I was distracted when I looked down at Caesar .
Meet me at the palace as soon as possible .
You're in a hurry , are you ?
And now , my friends , my courageous and educated friends , do me one small favor .
Come on , you're being too hard on yourself .
England would be lucky to have this virtuous prince as king .
No , wait .
He'll recover his sanity there .
We'll look for new friends and keep the company of strangers .
Who's this Adam you speak of ?
Enough !
He received me with courtesy and sufficient respect , but not with affection , nor with as much open and friendly conversation as he once greeted me .
What if a fellow were bringing him a couple of hundred pounds to toss around ?
No , go ahead and take my life .
Did you talk with this woman ?
Just tell me this : have you ever seen her holding a handkerchief with an embroidered strawberry pattern on it ?
That was a likely story , that you found it in your room and didn't know who it belonged to .
He can't like her very long .
You get trickier and trickier .
So will we all .
To work as a servant .
No .
Remember you !
If you're lying , I'll hang you alive from the nearest tree until you die of hunger .
Not long ago you challenged and opposed your brother , and it is only very recently that he has forgiven you .
I have done the deed .
Where is the king ?
What's the matter ?
No , no , I'm as ugly as a bear , since animals that see me run away in terror .
Take up my mistress ' gown for his master's use !
I'd obey even if she were my mother ten times over .
Something about Cyprus .
One of them was a man named Pinch : a hungry , narrow-faced villain ; a skeleton ; a fraud ; a raggedy magician and fortune-teller ; a needy , hollow-eyed , emaciated wretch ; a walking corpse .
What is it ?
I will , in other words , kill you in three hundred and fifty ways .
No metal , not even the executioner's axe , could ever be half as sharp as your hatred .
I couldn't pay my debt to the Jew on the due date .
Oh , Brutus !
Now , Antony , our prayers have been answered .
I sent the king's son off by himself to a faraway nook on the island , where he's sitting now sighing , with his arms crossed like this .
Come , let's be off !
Arrest him : he's a friend of the duke of Alencon's .
When you see him walking by here ( as I'll make sure he does between twelve and one ) you can nab him .
He doesn't have any daughters , sir .
Do you know the way to Dover ?
There's nothing else .
Please , give me that goblet , if you love me .
Where did you die ?
Come on .
Another case : Hugh Capet , who usurped the crown from Charles the duke of Lorraine , sole male heir in a direct line from Charles the Great , passed himself off as heir to Lady Lingare , daughter of Charlemagne , who was the son of Lewis the Emperor ( who was the son of Charles the Great ) , in order to give his claim to the throne more validity ( though , in fact , the claim was completely false and worthless ) .
You don't have a man's courage .
Oh , you're so lucky !
The king loves you very much .
I'm to blame for making you wait for me .
The gods do this to test my bravery .
I have news , ma'am .
That's burglary , that is .
I'll tell you .
Come on , envelope , open up for me .
They're on the march .
He doesn't have to care .
If you're my friend , tell me what you're thinking .
The villain won't escape .
Treat me like you would treat a dog , kick me , hit me , neglect me , try to lose me .
But if a man becomes weary of these obstacles , he can always kill himself .
I'll walk around and force the commoners off the streets .
My lord , what I say may be a little confused , since I'm half asleep and half awake .
I saw it with my own eyes .
Where's the cook ?
Help !
It's the last command I shall ever give you .
I've done everything you accuse me of , and more , much more .
But here's the plan : our army will stay with us on the hills by the city .
What's the matter ?
I know that my hour has come .
How are you ?
Oh , sir , you are too good at predicting the future .
You mean "paragon." A The duke's leaving the temple .
Please , father , I beg you .
There was no Signior Montanto in our army .
Come with me .
Greetings , dearest Caesar !
There isn't any kindness in the snake .
He's been killed .
These chatty fellows who can rhyme their way into a lady's good graces always reason themselves out again .
Now in the factory of thought , create the image of all London pouring forth into the streets .
He was very upset that Fortinbras had taken advantage of his being old and sick to deceive him , and he ordered Fortinbras's arrest .
Therefore , tell me , what is he doing at sea ?
But I have known people who sleepwalked and weren't guilty of anything .
I have no idea what you're talking about , Hamlet .
Please , one of you go ask that man over there if we can buy some food off him .
You can go straight to hell !
She will be pleased .
Neither good nor bad .
Where could I have lost that handkerchief , Emilia ?
After that , nothing can hurt him further , not weapons , poison , rebellion , invasion , or anything else .
I'm very glad .
I'll find him right away , sir , and carry out the business as well as I can .
Enough , enough .
Therefore , drink up. , Servant-monster , drink a toast to me .
You've won .
Saddle up my horses .
But once he got there , the duke learned that Lorenzo and his lover Jessica were together in a gondola .
Add defiance to all this and , by way of conclusion , tell him that he has betrayed the men who follow him , whose death sentence has been pronounced." My king and master's message delivered , my task is done .
I swear to God it's true , sir .
No , not at all .
Oh , if you could speak , I might hear you call Caesar an ass who's been outsmarted !
A nice message .
Which of us are you referring to ?
It's only going to make you sad , Monsieur Jaques .
Neither ?
My fears can't actually make you evil .
Will you marry us here , under this tree , or should we follow you to your chapel ?
Then I'll tell you .
We're at your service , my lord .
Why , he's the Prince's fool , and a very dull fool at that .
Why do you say that ?
Otherwise , I'll do it anytime , as long as I'm able .
I won't allow it .
I don't want to play now .
First , Peter Quince , tell us what the play is about , then read the names of the actors , and then shut up .
Come , let's have one more extravagant night .
And what are you going to do after you've spent your money ?
I will have when you hear the rest of what I have to say .
He's dead .
I hope it doesn't make me unchaste that I really want to be a married woman .
What should we do with all these rhyming fools that follow us from post to post ?
Your son is crazy .
Yes , for new lovers time passes ten times faster than for couples who've been married forever .
When he couldn't what ?
Please go inside .
Put out your torches .
Come on , you can go .
My darling Othello !
If you had foul words in your mouth , then your breath must be foul , and foul breath is nauseating .
I'll talk to you again tomorrow .
I asked you for gold to pay my soldiers , and you wouldn't give it to me .
Sister , calm down .
That's a Cornish name .
Some dungeon .
Please , sir , restrain yourself .
I'm sweating and trembling with fear .
Or rather , do what you feel like doing .
Think like this all day , and you'll learn how to curse .
I like you guys .
But there is no end , absolutely none , to my sexual desires .
Friendship is enduring except when love is involved .
Truly , madam , I don't hear anything .
We are destined to be betrayed when we are born .
Oh , I've heard him talk about that brother , and he described him as the most inhumane man alive .
Come , come , we're worrying about the worst-case scenario .
I've had to acknowledge that he's my son so many times that now I can do it without embarrassment .
Of all places , I don't like the
Make your boasts come true , and I'll be thrilled .
And that would be , ?
That's more than we know .
I'd be peering over maps to figure out the best ports , piers , and waterways .
And as you said ( and you said it wisely ) , it's good to have someone other than a mother listening in on them , since she can be too partial to him .
Are you there ?
There's money in it for you .
Get up from your beds as if you were rising out of your own graves , and walk like ghosts to come witness this horror .
According to what I heard , they had no travel plans as of last night .
Please , all of you , stand up .
I see you're all eaten up with emotion .
Just say it .
Don't play any nasty tricks on me .
Why did you leave your wife and child vulnerable , the most precious things in your life , those strong bonds of love ?
You talk to him , ma'am .
That's worse .
Please go back to Goneril's house .
Speak , my fair one , and speak fairly , I beg you .
You're wrong , sir , very wrong .
But on the prettiest branches Or at the end of every sentence I'll write "Rosalinda , " Teaching everyone who can read that the essence of every spirit Is contained in this one woman .
If you can't do it , be grateful you've lived this long and go wait to die in your cabin , if it comes to that. , Harder , men ! , Now get out of our way , I'm telling you .
Remember you !
If you hang around me for two more years , you'll forget the sound of your own voice .
No , I said his horse is coming , with him on its back .
It would be smart to offer someone poor and innocent like me as a sacrificial lamb to satisfy an angry god like Macbeth .
No , my lord .
Now she's gone forever. , Cordelia , Cordelia , stay a while .
Is it possible Fulvia is dead ?
What !
If she sends any letters to Richmond , you will be accountable to me for it .
No , it's just after twelve ; I heard the clock strike .
But my personal motivation , and that which should move you most to sanction my departure , is that Fulvia is dead .
Are you serious ?
I believe I have some choice in the matter , sir .
What news , man ?
Six pence a day would've been forced on him .
Your father !
My God , who knows ?
What's the bet ?
Isn't it possible to imagine that the noble ashes of Alexander the Great could end up plugging a hole in a barrel ?
Around three or four o'clock , look for news from the meeting hall .
I want to forget what I am .
I'll
Listen , listen !
Just now a tailor showed me fabrics he bought especially for me and then started to take my measurements .
But since you come from him , you're saturated with his healing spirit .
Yes , thoroughly .
Did you call for me , your Worship ?
Hello , Curan .
I'd be ashamed to give you this .
May God thank you for it .
Farewell to both of you , dear teachers .
Oh , give us permission , great king , to search the field in safety and dispose of our dead bodies .
Yes , sir , and I'll leave when you ask me to .
I'll break my spells and bring them back to their senses , and they'll feel like themselves again .
We want to hear Caesar's will .
Your mistress is a good mount .
I have done your bidding and fulfilled my promise .
The Turkish navy will be broken up .
Your wives , your daughters , your old women , and your young maids together could not satisfy my lust .
Nah , I'll never be aware of my own wit , until I break my shins on it .
Good-bye , great commander .
And yesterday the night owl sat hooting and shrieking in the marketplace at noon .
The servants of the Duke and my lieutenant ?
Help me !
In suicide , gods make the weak strong .
For what ?
I'll go to the hole to see if I can hear my Thisbe's face .
God alive !
Fair enough .
There , my lord .
A friend ?
There , take it all back , plates , cups , the whole thing .
Get to the point , since we already know the truth .
I found that handkerchief by accident and gave it to my husband .
still fight you and embed your lies back in your hellish heart. , Trumpets , blow !
Oh !
We'll rise and leave early tomorrow .
He's serious .
Be calm , dear lady .
His horse is killed , so he's fighting on foot , risking his life to search out Richmond .
If I agree to this , we may leave unharmed , with our shields undented .
Did he marry me just to starve me ?
Therefore I say again that he must have used some powerful drug or magic potion on her .
Ah , all you up in heaven !
I certainly did , and I never wanted to see you again .
Do this immediately , and don't stop searching and interrogating until you've brought home these foolish runaways .
What did he do that made him flee this land ?
So he's dead ?
Farewell .
I'm telling you , it's not lost .
That too .
Both ?
But when you are with him , your angel is weakened and easily frightened .
See , now I have you .
But when we have an hour to spare we can talk more about it , if you're willing .
Stop whining , devil .
If you want to pick a fight , you'll have to find a more substantial excuse .
He's hot-tempered , and he might try to hit you with his staff .
hundred times .
Lucius , wake up !
Two of my brother's men , all tied up !
Young budding virgin , fair and pure and sweet , where are you off to ?
Oh , I wish we could unmask scoundrels like that , and give a whip to every good man to beat them senseless with !
Follow me , then .
Gentle Octavia , support the one that supports you .
He does nothing but frown , as if he wants to say , "If you don't want me , I don't care." He doesn't even smile when he hears funny stories .
Don't laugh at me , but I swear I think this lady is my child Cordelia .
Who would do that ?
And whoever is most irritated by my foolishness has to laugh the hardest .
You haven't forgotten the half of a kingdom I gave you .
Oh God , remember to hear her prayer for them , just as for us !
Please forgive me as I forgive you , Hamlet .
If it were me , I'd be very upset too .
These are unnatural events .
I tell you , Charles , he's the stubbornest young fellow in France : overly ambitious , jealous of other people's good qualities , and a traitor against me , his own blood brother .
Thrice noble lord , I beg you to excuse me for another night or two , or at least until nightfall .
Oh , God !
That's what I'm afraid of .
And you're right to do so .
If you see me without it , you can be confident I'm dead .
My name is Decretus .
Why are they running away ?
My first question for Nerissa is whether she'd rather wait till tomorrow night or go to bed now , since there are only two more hours till morning .
So you couldn't see his face , then ?
And whatever we do , we can lay all the blame on the drunken servants .
Here's an empty seat , sir .
Come , find the conspirators !
With those plays in mind , we hope you'll receive this one kindly .
Anyone who builds his hopes on air lives like a drunken sailor hanging on a mast , ready with every dizzy nod of his head to tumble to the bottom of the sea .
And I believe , unless this brain of mine is not so politically cunning as it used to be , that I've found out why Hamlet's gone crazy .
Ratcliffe !
I love you dearly , Ariel .
Stand further away .
Isn't there one man left in the world who knows not to take a wife ?
You can see my ribs so well you can count them .
You'd better understand that I won't wait till I'm chained up in your master's court , and I won't let myself be scolded even once by dull Octavia .
Which speech , my lord ?
Who's there ?
Oh , the glory of war has faded .
You're lucky , my lord , to be able to see the peace and sweetness even in what bad luck has brought you .
Where should we go ?
I'm afraid that I wrong the honorable men whose daggers have stabbed Caesar .
How beautiful the moonlight's shining on this bank !
Even if we fail at that , we can still fight him on land .
All traitors protest like this .
Tomorrow night , when the moon shines on the water and decorates the grass with tiny beads of pearly light ( the time of night that always hides runaway lovers ) , we plan to sneak out of Athens .
I wish I could see that man someday !
Many men would take you literally and take off with all this money .
I don't understand why they're all here together .
I'll wear this one and none other .
The air is sweet and appeals to my refined senses .
Orlando sends his regards to you both , and he sends this bloody handkerchief to the boy he calls "his Rosalind." Is that you ?
Have you seen a farmer's dog bark at a beggar ?
She can stay at her father's house .
I smile and think , "Thank goodness the wind doesn't flatter me : it's like a councilor who makes me feel what I'm really made of." Adversity can have its benefits , like the ugly , poisonous I wouldn't change my situation for anything .
Sir , is it possible that a person could fall in love so suddenly ?
So I thank you all , and I invite each and every one of you to come watch me be crowned king of Scotland at Scone .
What a strange sight , a man who has put on all his fancy clothes but forgotten his brain at home !
Bring that swinger Orlando here .
I say he shall go to prison .
The rooster has already crowed twice .
Goodbye , good sir .
You're not going anywhere .
Write down that Prince John is a villain .
I'll go too and make sure that happens .
Oh ho , is that what you're getting at ?
Quiet !
I'll write to my sister and tell her my plans .
I'll tell you everything exactly as it happened .
This dream has been interpreted all wrong .
Amen .
Let go of it !
I've transferred Richard's body to a new grave and on it poured more tears of remorse than it has shed drops of blood .
We're here to say "amen" to that .
Come on , you .
What's amazing is how long he lasted .
See how he stands between two clergymen !
Hang there on this tree , you lines of poetry , and bear witness to my love .
Let heaven be my witness , I'm putting my mind , my heart , and my hands in Othello's control .
Regarding the Dauphin , you can speak to me .
Listen to him speaking in quarter notes !
I have no desire to go outside , yet something leads me there .
What's going on , Borachio ?
I'm so crazy about you !
Let's start .
Would your Honor like to try this dried fruit ?
My name is Proculeius .
Then let's meet with our senior command and discuss what to do next .
Go !
Okay , so that's when he'll say we stabbed him in his sleep .
Then be so kind as to show them in .
Cassio's a good friend of mine , My lord , I can see you're upset .
Oh , heaven , how did she get out ?
He's flabby and out of breath. , Here , Hamlet , take my handkerchief and wipe your forehead .
A man , like you .
Yes , quite a large one , with many cells and dungeons , Denmark being one of the worst .
The watchdogs bark .
That tree could be called God's tree , since it drops such wonderful fruit .
I'll call you "Hamlet Senior , " "King , " "Father , " "royal Dane." Answer me !
Your mother's been poisoned .
Well , Petruchio , all this is very encouraging .
Let's go back to our bedroom .
This damned witch Sycorax was kicked out of Algiers for various witching crimes too terrible for humans to hear about .
Whip him !
You stopped me .
When they feared death , they escaped with their lives ; and now where they imagine they're safe , they perish .
We'll begin the ceremony the way we hope it will end , with delight .
Will you do that for me , Silvius ?
In that case , there's reason to hope a man's memory may outlive him by six months .
Oh , help me , anyone who wants to live long !
Carry him away .
Is his ship sturdy ?
Got it , sir .
Hey , open the door !
Pass on the command to halt !
That's the way it goes .
Well , then it will be dry .
Indeed , his mocking spirit has now crawled into a Truly , it all adds up to a serious story for Benedick .
He's praying now .
What do you think ?
Be there , or don't show your face again .
I have to go to England , don't you know that ?
Go , bring him here , boy .
If I died right now I'd be completely happy , since I'll probably never be as happy as this again in my life .
Your husband .
I don't know why I should be afraid , since I haven't done anything wrong .
You will pretend to be a schoolmaster and offer to teach the girl .
He will , sir , if He wants to .
His daughters want to kill him .
No , vain illusion , so intricately bound up with a king's rest .
The gods can hear you lying !
You were a cold crumb on dead Julius Caesar's plate when I met you .
And how would we go about doing that ?
Yes , every man forward .
him terribly .
I wish I could repay this happy news with good news of my own .
Give me your hand .
Dorset , embrace Hastings. , Hastings , express your affection for the marquess of Dorset .
Where's your lute ?
What's this part for ?
Go walk the path that you will never return from .
And it's definitely better to cry because you're happy than laugh because you're sad !
But listen to me , signor ,
I feel tortured by all this talking .
Listen to this , King : as soon as we sent those Irish soldiers running for cover , the Norwegian king saw his chance to attack us with fresh troops and shiny weapons .
A fair woman !
Let him become Caesar !
Your parents are lucky to have such a lovely child .
Messala , I have received these letters explaining that young Octavius and Mark Antony are rushing toward Philippi and bearing down upon us with a mighty power .
Those who smile at it will soon be dead themselves .
Has it been a quiet night ?
We're still just beginners when it comes to crime .
And when will you see him again ?
That's why it's better for wise men to trumpet their own virtues , like I do .
Only when they're dead can I start to count my gains .
Then leave her , sir .
I've seen her claim to be dying twenty times before , and for far less reason .
No , it wasn't .
God bless your Grace with health and happy days .
This week he was sad , moody , and depressed and very different from his usual self .
Gratiano talks more nonsense than any other man in Venice .
My lord , I have news for you .
Here , my lord .
The moment they planned to act is almost here .
My God , that's my handkerchief !
The Danes , the Germans , and the Dutch , come on , drink , drink ! , are nothing compared to the English .
Yes , let her die and rot and go to hell tonight .
They made more money and got more attention in the city .
You haven't seen anything , then ?
It's all stopped .
Understand ?
I don't know , madam .
Signior Leonato , listen to the friar's plan .
No one , Brutus , no one .
Cupid is a bad boy for making poor women go crazy like this .
Not even one success ?
Then know that from my soul I love your daughter .
May God be at your table .
I can arrange it so that at some indecent hour of the night , she looks out Hero's bedroom window .
Ratcliffe , around midnight come to my tent and help me put on my armor .
Yes , I thank God , my father , and yourself .
The lady has died because of the false accusations of me and my master .
Don't you know that I have offered these bones of mine for ransom ?
Let's say I didn't kill them .
Your wit is so forceful , it frightens the very meaning out of your words .
For God's sake , sir , you've been robbed .
Shame on you , get on board !
I'll leave you now to chatter and gossip like an old woman .
I won't have anything to do with it .
Why would Titania want to argue with her Oberon ?
Or are we both on drugs ?
Go find out the news .
I am at your service .
I'll give my life for you , just to prove this guy wrong when he says I don't love you .
My son will win .
Oh , dear husband , don't believe everything you hear , or if you must believe it , don't let it all make you angry .
I know him ; he wears a lock of hair .
Poison never came from such a sweet place .
It was incredible !
I'd rather give myself up to the hatred of a violent brother who refuses to recognize that we are brothers .
Kent , father , sisters !
I'll ask you another question .
We've all come out to see what will happen. , Go , Hercules !
Yes .
And to make it even clearer , we can tell them that I'm playing Pyramus but I'm not really Pyramus , really , I'm Bottom the weaver .
Give me your first , Mr. Mustardseed .
I'm ready now to hear what my good cousin the Dauphin has to say , for I hear that the greeting you bear is from him , not the king .
Hurry , hurry , close the curtain quick .
Here I lie and will never get up again .
I hear his footsteps .
But could beauty be related to anything better than goodness ?
To Baptista Minola's house .
And so the Jew may lawfully claim a pound of flesh nearest the merchant's heart , to be cut off by him. , But please have mercy .
Then if we lose this battle , you'll be willing to be led in chains through the streets of Rome ?
Well then , he's God's soldier now !
I'm sorry , my friend .
He'll bring a lot of money to the person who owns him , that's for sure .
You've said it well .
Please forgive me if I'm mistaken , my lord , but I can't keep quiet when I think you're being insulted .
And if I were king of it , you know what I'd do ?
Help !
Sometimes I'll turn into fire !
Shylock , are you listening ?
Can you tell me if a man named Launcelot , who lives with him , is still there ?
I wish some god could help me choose !
How did he try to persuade you to love him ?
This letter from Bellario introduces us to a young and well-educated legal expert .
Self-love , my liege , is not so great a sin as self-neglect .
Say what you're here for .
That's not good , and no good can come of it either .
What should we do about that ?
Stay hidden and listen .
But I don't have any good sides .
Here's mine .
Look , he's moving .
Go tell the king I want to talk to him for a few minutes .
Curse you !
It is a trade , sir , that I practice with a clear conscience .
God will take revenge .
I'll have them sleep on cushions in my tent .
Why do you think I'm making fun of you when I tell you I love you ?
When the day comes , I'll wish it were nighttime , so I could sleep with the legal expert's clerk .
He's an admirable man .
May God reward you for your kindness !
My Queen and Eros have by their brave examples beaten me to the history books .
This world is almost six thousand years old , and in all this time not one man has ever actually died from love .
Get out of here , you blathering peasant !
It'd be impossible for you to watch them , even if they were as horny as animals in heat and as stupid as drunks .
I'm afraid he'll punish me .
I hope for my brother's sake that he just wrote it to test my honor .
Don't let him leave out the color of her hair .
He asks her to do what God Say she will be a high and mighty queen .
Go away and let me die .
Set fire !
I have to follow him and give him the letter .
Please , leave me alone .
Since this prize is yours , Be happy with it , and don't look for a new one .
Sure , since beauty's power can more easily change a good girl into a whore than the power of goodness can change a beautiful girl into a virgin .
It's a good thing I'm like a little pot and warm up quickly , or else my lips themselves would freeze and stick to my teeth , my tongue to the roof of my mouth , and my heart would freeze in my belly , before I managed to get thawed out .
If we do , it'll drive us crazy .
Let Rome fall !
How are you doing , brother ?
I don't know what you mean , madam .
The adult snake lies in the ditch .
I heard the owl scream and the crickets cry .
Killing men in the dark ?
So be it .
What , don't courtiers ' hands sweat ?
Your scolding is somewhat overblown .
Stay down , heart .
You know what I intend .
Is that true ?
I'm a carpenter , sir .
Cut my corset laces , Charmian , so I can breathe .
His coffers are too poor to atone for our losses , his entire kingdom too small to account for the amount of blood we've shed , and the sight of him kneeling at our feet an empty satisfaction compared to the indignity we have put up with .
Is he losing his mind ?
You are my other self , my oracle , my prophet , my dear brother !
Good noble ladies , be brave .
Not offensive at all .
Only Antony was at fault .
This choice was as foolish as they are .
Away , get out of here .
I needn't be ashamed of your Majesty , God be praised , so long as your Majesty is an honest man .
Wash your hands .
But in fact it doesn't say much .
Not in my house , Lucentio .
A sailor's wife had chestnuts in her lap and munched away at them .
Men may sleep , and when they do they may have their throats with them , and some people say knives have blades .
Sorrow interrupts all hours and seasons .
But you're still my child , my flesh and blood , or rather you're a disease in my flesh , a disease I still have to call my own .
I still have the smell of blood on my hand .
Oh , this is wonderful , wonderful , just wonderful wonderful !
This one , and I will give her to you .
Get us out of here .
Then let the rain come down .
I'll also wear this in my cap .
Stop , even if only to kill me .
No ship could survive this storm .
If I ever come back , I'll bring you good news .
Dorset has fled to the earl of Richmond .
The island must be mild , and have a temperate climate .
Have a good life .
But , my good lord , the words of you and Lord Buckingham are as trustworthy to me as if I had seen and heard him speak myself .
Iago's a good man .
He is the general challenger .
Caesar , beware of Brutus .
Do you think so , spirit ?
You have a fat friend at your master's house : she took care of me in the kitchen today , thinking I was you .
Had the gods taken pity on us , I wouldn't be here calling them merciless .
She'll be damned for it .
Help !
Don't be afraid of her company .
No , dear Queen .
Defend me , God , both when I'm asleep and when I'm awake .
I'll walk up and down and sing a song , so they'll know I'm not afraid .
From head to toe ?
Whenever you're ready , hostess .
Farewell , sir .
I swear on my life and honor , he'll sit here in the stocks until noon .
Yes , " said my uncle Gloucester , "Small plants are graceful , while ugly weeds grow fast." And since then , I've wished I wouldn't grow so fast , because sweet flowers are slow while the weeds grow in a hurry .
What a spoiled little brat .
Yes , they're spirits that I've called out of their prisons to perform my whims .
Tell the actors to hurry .
So it's no surprise that Demetrius runs away from me as if I were a monster .
Well , what's your plan ?
I'm full of joy .
If we lose , what do you plan to do ?
And though his feelings may be pitched higher than ours , when they plummet , they plummet that much farther .
Whether your banquet is first or last , your Egyptian cooking will make it the best .
All right then .
I'd tell them that I saw natives like these , since they must be natives , who are graceful and well-mannered even if they're monstrous to look at , kinder than most human beings you might find , kinder than almost any human .
My mind and courage will never falter with doubt or shake with fear .
And lovers ' hours are a hundred and sixty times longer than normal ones !
What is this spirit that looks like the son of a king and wears a crown on his young head ?
Madam ?
When was the last time you saw my father ?
Sir , he told me quite bluntly that he didn't feel like it .
The whole time .
He constantly offends me .
The poor rude world doesn't have her equal .
We're lucky that Rome is rid of him .
Am I myself ?
Now that's done , I'm going to walk on the fortification walls .
Yes , that's quite likely .
That's the necklace I gave you , sir .
I shall faint .
He did , very sincerely .
Stay here .
And Cassius too .
They pulled out the guts of the sacrificed animal and couldn't find its heart .
I assure you , sir , it's true .
Look !
Good morning , sweet Hero .
Where are his eyes ?
Take his sword away from him .
I'll do the best I can , my lord .
Her grapes , which make the wine that cheers our hearts , die unpruned on the vines .
I surrender your dukedom and beg you to forgive me all my crimes .
That's not good .
The law's on my side .
My heart's as black as death .
May heaven bless you .
That's what I'm doing .
Who's there , aside from this foul weather ?
Follow me if you're brave enough , and we'll fight over Helena .
Did you hit your head ?
But I'll tell you something from my soul .
He doesn't speak Latin , French , or Italian , and you know how little English I speak .
Oh , forgive all my sins !
I mean , is the jay more precious than the lark because his feather is more beautiful ?
I will walk around and mingle with all of you , playing the humble host .
Now , most noble Brutus , the gods are friendly with us today so that we , who want peace , can live on to old age !
The Queen is coming .
Dido was from Carthage , not Tunis .
As for us , you know we are Antony's , and he is Caesar's .
Here I'm kneeling to swear that if I ever did anything to destroy his love for me , either by thoughts or actions , or if I ever took pleasure in anyone else , or if I never did love him , or don't love him now , even though he tries to shake me off ,
Like an invitation .
The armies were like two exhausted swimmers clinging to each other and struggling in the water , unable to move .
It's just that my wit is very gentlemanly , Margaret , and refuses to hurt a woman .
The world's huge .
So is my horse , Octavius , and for that reason I give him all the hay he wants .
And I for Rosalind .
Whether you're a good spirit or a cursed demon , whether you bring heavenly breezes or blasts of hell fire , whether your intentions are good or evil , you look so strange I want to talk to you .
I regret not observing him more closely before I told you to do that .
They got what they deserved .
I need to be alone with my thoughts for a while and don't want any company .
Would you like to be king of the entire world ?
I ask for him , and he comes .
A conclusion , a conclusion : he is in love .
I don't know .
Why are you whispering ?
Oh , the poor man !
He's still sharp when it comes to carrying out a bold or noble enterprise , though he puts on this show of stupidity .
I'm here .
But action speaks louder than words , so I'll cut short these polite words .
But we won't shift the scene to Southampton until Henry reappears .
I should always be wise .
Yes , sir , I'm here .
What did he tell you , Ophelia ?
I rely on your virtue to protect me .
You're talking about killing ?
You dog , you peasant !
She's desperate .
Oh , dear God , don't let me go mad !
Don't think I'm so dumb that I don't know that the devil himself won't eat a woman .
Paying debts is for peasants .
The spirits that know the future have told me this : "Don't be afraid , Macbeth .
Yes , why shouldn't she ?
I wasn't talking to any man at that time , my lord .
To tell you that you'll see me at Philippi .
Now , my sweet lord , you know how much I like you .
Not so fast .
It would be a pity to throw them away for nothing , but if it's a matter of choosing between them and a great cause , then they're worthless .
Most mighty sovereign , you have no reason to doubt my friendship .
All three of us will marry now in death .
What is it ?
I'll give the Jew my flesh , blood , bones , and everything before you lose one drop of blood for me .
Large and increasing .
God say , "Amen" !
Are you sure we're awake ?
I didn't like the way a particular courtier had cut his beard .
We came into the world as brother and brother , so now let's enter hand in hand , not one before the other .
I'll read it aloud .
As you all know , overconfidence is man's greatest enemy .
Brown , madam , and she wouldn't want her forehead to be any lower .
They're speaking to him .
Long live Theseus , our famous and respected duke !
And when you married him and made him the master of your bed , I gave you my word that I would do everything I possibly could for him .
Good-bye .
I'm a foolish , senile old man , eighty-something years old , not an hour more or less .
You're a lying , cowardly wretch .
What does that have to do with my Lysander ?
What do you have to say for yourself ?
No Duke of spineless Burgundy can take this treasure of a girl from me now. , Say goodbye to them , Cordelia , even though they've been unkind to you .
He swore that he'd never get married , but now , despite his earlier protestations , he loves ungrudgingly .
He left to fetch a necklace and he promised to bring it to the Porcupine , where I was dining with Balthasar .
If I told them about this back in Naples , would they believe me ?
The young generation rises while the old one falls .
What's going on these days ?
Dead .
It would be better for Macbeth to rule than someone like me .
Let me see his face .
I'll listen to Cassius , and we will compare their reasons .
Everyone except the sailors dove into the sea , leaving behind the ship that I had set on fire .
Your authorization is ready .
If you're happy with what you've won And accept this prize as your blissful destiny , Then turn to where your lady is , And claim her with a loving kiss."
Nothing .
The source from which your royal blood comes has been stopped .
While the moon was shining we didn't even notice the candle .
Now I'll go inside and write out a secret order to keep Clarence's brats out of sight and to forbid anyone whatsoever from seeing King Edward's sons .
May the gods bless Antony today !
Oh , I wish I could sleep again , so I could have another dream like that !
Can't a plain man live and do no harm to anyone without being taken advantage of by a bunch of slick , sneaky lowlifes ?
What did he say ?
So go in peace .
But in this way , grief and comfort appear together .
I'm very afraid of Banquo .
Why are you leading these men through the streets ?
I'm in a good mood now and likely to give you what you want .
I swear by my sword , Swear by your shield , too !
So it's nearly the time when the ghost likes to appear .
You'd better knock louder .
I'll think over what you've said , I'll listen patiently to whatever else you have to say , and I'll find a good time for us to discuss further such weighty matters .
Did you hear that ?
You are the best of the cutthroats .
Count how many times the clock chimes .
How many noblemen were killed in the battle you just fought ?
No more about that , please .
Well , I think that even if it weren't on record , the truth would be remembered from one generation to the next , all the way to Doomsday .
I'll take responsibility for that .
He's certainly crossed the river Somme .
Goodbye , Helena .
Since he has the jewel I loved , which you swore you'd keep forever , I'll be as generous as you were to him .
A simple country farmer who brought her figs .
Yes , my lord ?
Command this man to leave .
Where's the jury , the judge , the lawful proceedings , the verdict ?
You know that Banquo and his son Fleance are still alive .
Do so .
But everything that lives is mortal , including the foolishness of love .
I thank your Highness .
They say the horses ate each other .
That's right .
Swear by my sword .
Watch Titinius and tell me what you see in the field .
I had my father's signet ring in my pocket , with the royal seal of Denmark on it .
Actually , I'm still feeling some pangs of conscience .
Well , Aren't I right , Jephthah , old man ?
I don't understand why she's not locked up .
I saw him once .
Let me wrap up your head , and it will feel okay in less than an hour .
He's going after a young widow .
Now I say good night to your bones , Hero .
The Duke's in a meeting right now , and he's sent for you too .
I wouldn't allow your enemies to say that , and I won't believe it from you .
I won't bother you .
Write all this
Choose another tack .
Let me choose now .
It must be .
But I have the meantime .
Nothing that interests me , my good lord .
That's definitely true , my lord .
I would rather be a country serving maid than a great queen if it meant I could escape your scorn and constant harassment .
Well , that's what he's doing , making you free to enjoy heaven .
Yeah , that would get every single one of us executed .
Sirs , take up the corpse .
I didn't refuse you .
Then how will we see their own natural tears ?
What was the second noise for ?
Tomorrow , and tomorrow , and tomorrow .
Didn't you figure out that I left you because I hate you ?
Claudio !
I will .
It's time to end it , good lady .
Indeed , sir , it is .
I guess this is not a fish , but a native who got struck by lightning just now .
Scorn and defiance , indifference , contempt , and any insult that wouldn't disgrace the mighty sender , that's the value he puts on you .
Go and get our stuff onto the ship .
I wish I had a fault like that !
Yes , he does .
My lord ?
Do you know them ?
When I work it over with magic spells , the drop will produce magical spirits that will trick Macbeth with illusions .
I thought he was just toying with you and meant to ruin your reputation .
Let's go back to court together , but
He has almost finished dinner .
We still have hope .
You're trying to trick me , my lord .
It is .
I just know I'm not one .
Oh , no , good gentleman !
I don't know about that .
Why are you doing this ?
Farewell .
Isn't it strange , Canidius , that he could cross the Ionian Sea so quickly from Tarentum and Brundusium and take Toryne ? , Have you heard about this , sweet ?
Look how politely it's pointing you to a place that's farther away .
Two thousand ducats a year from his land !
Don't you remember how he saw a flea land on Bardolph's nose and said it was a black soul burning in hell ?
Nothing can be made out of nothing .
Is there a murderer here ?
Do you know me ?
I just want everything to be all right between you .
I've come to take you to the senate house .
Macbeth !
My lord , good morning .
Lorenzo , please take charge of the management of my house until my husband comes back .
Take good care of him .
No , we'll all go there to bring him .
If not , I'll challenge you to a duel .
My lord , here is the entrance .
Forever and forever , farewell , Brutus !
In the meantime , think about how I can do you good and give you what you want .
And I hope you won't think badly of me .
It's strongest in the strongest people .
Are they as popular as they used to be when I lived in the city ?
You want me to copy the embroidery pattern ?
The blows I gave you already will make up for your upsetting me .
Silence , then !
Who was with them last ?
Hero thinks Beatrice will surely die , for she says she'll die if he doesn't love her , and that she'll die before she tells him , and she'll die if he woos her and she's made to hold back even one of her usual insults .
Yes , now I'm in Arden , and that makes me the bigger fool .
This way , my lord .
Tell me , spirit , how's the king and his entourage ?
Farewell .
I'm not Cinna the conspirator .
Your threats don't scare me , Cassius , because I'm so secure in my honesty and integrity that they pass me by like a weak breeze .
We need a calendar !
It's certain that she is dead , and she died in a strange way .
He lost both , my lord. , Ma'am , this letter is from your sister , and needs an immediate answer .
Prepare yourselves , generals .
It's strange , strange .
Who can say I'm evil when my advice is so good ?
By risking the second arrow , I'd often get both of them back .
Could my good brother-in-law , a man to whom the
Queen of Egypt , greetings !
Tell me , is it missing ?
Not yet , cousin .
The king and the prince are praying .
Me too .
If that's the case , tears wash my eyes more than hers .
We beg you , for your own sake , to respect your safety and give up .
Can't you talk ?
If we didn't have rational minds to counterbalance our emotions and desires , our bodily urges would take over .
Here , sir ! " You stupid , unpolished dolts !
Look , it's my dear Lady Disdain !
Have him come to me here , soldier .
Let me at him .
What music should we play then ?
How many , can you guess ?
How goes it , friend Eros ?
Let's lay everything upon the king : our lives , our souls , our debts , our anxious wives , our children , and our sins." I must bear responsibility for all of it .
We have in fact seen better days and been summoned to church by the ringing of the holy bell and sat at good men's feasts and cried tears of pity , therefore , sit down and take whatever will satisfy your needs .
Good Lord !
I don't think so .
But how would you praise a truly good woman , someone who had no reason to worry about what anyone said about her ?
Even my hair revolts .
Did he treat you well when you saw him ?
Watch out , boy , remember I can whip you .
She was so young , but she deceived her father so thoroughly he thought it was witchcraft !
He's given me a second life , and marrying her makes him a second father to me .
No , I don't want to send your soul to hell when I kill you .
She says that you should come to her .
Give me your hand .
Oh , yes , I'm sorry , uncle. , If you'll excuse me , your grace .
If you love Rosalind as much as you say you do , you will marry her when your brother marries Aliena .
It's doubly wrong to cheat on your wife and then let her see the offense in your eyes .
Why not ?
Is he all right ?
I'll pay you for your trouble .
Myself ?
Do that , and I'll set you free in two days .
My Lord of Warwick and my brother Gloucester , follow Fluellen at a close distance .
I can't believe that .
But I think , I want to tell you the truth , and now that I think about it , I think this is true , I came here with Hermia .
Look , he's recovering .
They're as opposite as hot and cold .
More , please , more .
And like I am for Rosalind .
Is this well done ?
And yet I wouldn't want to be you , uncle .
So why does it seem so particular to you ?
Or come back to life again and challenge me to a duel in some deserted place .
Even good men have bad luck .
I beg you to continue to be patient .
You don't really love me .
God protect you from them and from other false friends !
For now , don't try to persuade me anymore , I ask you as a friend .
I'll bring you to him right away .
What do you say ?
She has the stones on her , and the ducats." I know , all the boys in Venice are following him , yelling , "His stones , his daughter , and his ducats ! "
Rub his temples .
A little water will wash away the evidence of our guilt .
Maybe the king is sending you to the Tower to have you renamed .
Boy , I beg you to run to the senate house .
Please don't cry .
Damn it !
Now I'll tell you the other story about my journey .
I wish you all the comfort that such a dark night as this can offer , noble father-in-law .
That's a lame threat from a toy gun , a poor individual's private displeasure with a monarch .
Why do you keep repeating that , woman ?
No , it's a story .
A rebel !
Your friends at Pomfret , they're the ones who need a priest .
The three who share the known world are aboard your boat .
But how can you say that , when the king himself says you're the heir to the Danish throne ?
Thank you , my noble lord .
Never apologize , when the actors are all dead , no one can be blamed .
man's cheeks .
I can't see ahead of me .
Everything will be all right .
Yes , revered Queen .
I hope , sir , that you're not angry that I've been equally attentive to you both !
Tomorrow , soldier , I'll fight by sea and land .
He commanded me to wake him up early .
I'll get there .
You can see for yourself .
That island of England breeds very valiant creatures .
And I followed him because I loved him .
It's yours , and you may hang us , your trophies of war , anywhere you like .
Please take them .
If true lovers are always thwarted , then it must be a rule of fate .
There'd be no work .
Yes , as much pleasure as one might take in choking a bird at knifepoint .
Don't just swear by it ; put your hand to some use that will prove you love me .
Norfolk , we're going to have a few blows , right ?
But you can make it up to me .
We are responsible for this .
By God , I'm going to tell the duke how slack you've been .
The one who claims to be your wife just ran away from you .
Cicero too ?
Hello , Iago .
Small but brave in his surroundings , he's trying to stand up against the wind and rain blowing back and forth .
Oh , unfaithful lover !
What if I went no further and chose this one ?
Of brave earls , Grandpre and Roussi , Fauconberg and Foix , Beaumont and Marle , Vaudemont and Lestrale .
Let's go to the king .
It was I , in fact , whom you promised to strike .
At dinner .
They certainly do like to butt heads !
We came here to fight against you .
I will proclaim my name around the field .
More shouting !
Come on , close the curtain , Nerissa .
She thinks I'll marry her because she loves me .
That way , he'll waste his provisions and tire out his soldiers , weakening his own capacities , while we , lying still , are rested , energetic , and nimble .
I know you are loyal and honorable .
We grew together like twin cherries , which seemed to be separate but were also together , two lovely cherries on one stem .
It's better to be the person who gets murdered than to be the killer and be tormented with anxiety .
Gracious Lord , blunt the swords of those traitors who mean to tear poor England apart again !
Signior Balthasar , you look upset .
The English are in the field , French lords .
Age won't wither her , and her charms are so varied that she never grows boring .
Listen , will you walk with me around the town and then dine with me at the inn ?
Madam ?
We're not invading England out of ambition or greed , but out of love , dear love ! , and my father's right to his kingdom .
In every one of the lords ' households I have a servant paid to spy for me .
You're not thinking of leaving tonight , surely ?
But what danger we'll put ourselves in , two young , innocent women traveling so far !
Here , take away the dish .
Before sunrise tomorrow , we'll kill anyone who escaped today .
It's pretty .
There's no doubt that Petruchio's got quite a catch .
There she is .
The two of us will guard you while you sleep , my lord , and keep you safe .
You thug !
Please be careful .
I asked you again , and you scratched your head and stamped your foot impatiently .
Two reasons .
I hear him .
No , I'll walk right next to you , side by side .
We seemed to have two separate bodies , but we had one heart .
This was the most unkind cut of all .
They tell me you've done everything you can to talk him out of what he's doing .
Well , if you could have just an inch of better fortune than me , where would you like the improvement ?
Gentle cousin , let's go thank him and encourage him .
We three couples will celebrate with a sumptuous feast .
I'm not well .
Shall I let them exhibit me to the shouting mobs of Rome ?
Here's mine .
They really wish they were somewhere else , but they want to descend on us , looking fierce so we'll think they're brave .
I don't expect him to answer for me , and yet I'm determined to fight vigorously for him .
Blow the trumpet !
And if our navy wins tomorrow , no doubt our army will do their part .
I suggest you lay low until his rage cools a little .
Did you accompany Caesar home ?
Yes , and the best looking too .
Give me your blessing .
It's not right to obey his orders to let him go alone .
It's a letter from my brother that I haven't finished reading yet .
Mankind is so beautiful !
No , instead I'll go to Benedick and advise him to fight his emotions .
She's no longer my daughter , and I'll never see her face again .
Oh , dear God , please help him !
Do you really think that if it came down to my word against yours , anyone would believe you ?
Be patient , madam .
The original story was written in the finest Italian .
Good morrow , neighbor , whither away so fast ?
You get my point , don't you ?
But here's a paper with Caesar's seal on it .
Yes .
Let thunder rumble !
Can I do what all the Parthian arrows , though shot by enemies , could not ?
Come , Dromio , let's go .
Mark Antony , take Caesar's body .
Come on , sir .
Where do you think he is now ?
Either let heaven send lightning to strike the murderer dead or let the earth open wide and devour him , as it does this good king's blood .
Can you help me ?
What's that paper you were reading ?
There was no harm , I'm telling you .
And like I am for Ganymede .
Heart , for once be stronger than all the rest of the body combined .
Curse my hand if it ever threatened an old man like you .
I'm glad you've come , father .
And Benedick is not the worst husband I can think of .
He wouldn't get drunk much , since there's no wine here .
I'm not interested in anything a eunuch can do .
He did touch on women a bit , but his body was aching with fever and he talked about the Whore of Babylon .
I want this to provoke confrontations , so I can give him a piece of my mind .
This is no way to treat a host who has welcomed you into his house .
How did you lose your breath ?
If the other two are as loopy as we are , our country's in bad shape .
Portia !
Once we have covered the two servants with blood , and used their daggers to kill , won't people believe that they were the culprits ?
Go on .
Your wife , Fulvia , is dead .
This means I've mistreated Edgar .
I'm going inside to think up some way to kill that beautiful devil .
Besides , I don't like you .
How are you , soldier ?
Do we have devils on the island ?
Meanwhile , their They've said their prayers , and now they wait for death .
Losers always leave quickly .
Are you going to pay the eight shillings I won from you in a bet ?
Listen , but don't speak .
Kings have trembled to kiss this hand .
Into God's hands .
Tell her that I , her king , am her lowly subject .
Well then , can't I act as Rosalind for you tomorrow ?
For heaven's sake , help me !
And here I am , going crazy in the middle of the woods because I can't find my Hermia .
Where are you going ?
And then again , it's not so good , but only so-so .
Did she give up all those chances to marry noblemen , give up her father and country and friends , just to be called a whore ?
Is this my prize ?
I'm never in the mood to laugh when I hear sweet music .
I'll be nice to him .
I await justice .
I hope to God I'm proven wrong !
First let's go to dinner .
Yes , unfortunately .
I'd be as right for the job as you are , and I'd do it more easily , since I'd have good will on my side .
Whom should we look for in the castle ? , Whose job is it ?
And buried , noble Tyrrel ?
I can justify that better than you can justify sleeping with Portia's African servant .
Take pity on Poor Tom , who is persecuted by the devil .
Spread the rumor abroad that Anne , my wife , is very sick .
He will have only justice and his penalty .
I'll go back to sleep now .
I'll go to the Antipodes for any little errand you can think of .
I will find the time to cry for you , Cassius , I'll find the time .
And when a wise man gives you better advice than I just did , give me my advice back again .
Please don't play games .
He got what he deserved .
My liege , this man is a villain and a traitor , who , see , your Grace , has struck the glove which your Majesty took from Alencon's helmet .
No drugs or sleeping pills will ever give you the restful sleep that you had last night .
No problem , madam .
I know what I'm talking about .
Here's the money you wanted , master .
Then that's the way it'll be .
May you choke on any other sentiments like that !
It never occurred to me to imagine there was anything more to know .
All your talents and gifts didn't arouse as much envy from him as this one quality did , though to me it's far from your best attribute .
Mark Antony will say I'm not well , and to please you I'll stay at home .
If I can tame him , I'll charge as much as I can get for him .
The lieutenant has to get to heaven before the ensign .
Is that what you've heard ?
I just saw him yesterday , " or "the other day , " or whenever it is , you know , "and there he was gambling , " or "there he was , totally wasted , or fighting with somebody about a tennis match , or going into a house of ill repute" , that means a whorehouse , you know , or whatever .
Disrespected in my own house by a spool of thread !
You wronged yourself to write on behalf of such a man .
Your words , like your wounds , bring you honor .
Thanks , my dear lord .
The problem is that they have to compete with a group of children who yell out their lines and receive outrageous applause for it .
Is it a habit of his ?
We achieve things with our intelligence , not by magic , and intelligent planning takes time .
By the light of heaven , no , I would not !
So that's what I'll do , not because I love her but because I'll get something out of it .
The taming school ?
Yes .
I sent Dromio to you with money for bail , but I don't think he brought it to you .
Yes , I do , sir .
No , no , put your hat back on .
It's women crying , my good lord .
It applies to you as much as to me , my lord .
I'll have glory in this losing day , more than Octavius and Mark Antony will gain by their foul conquest .
Here .
But excuse me , Yes , I'm talking about Launcelot , sir .
Time to buy myself a mirror and employ a few dozen tailors to dress me up in the current fashions .
This guy doesn't pay much attention to punctuation .
God bless you for being here .
I found this pinned to my tent this morning .
Do something about it , then .
I doubt it's anything but the obvious reason : his father's dying and our quick marriage .
I won't .
I swear to you , many members of your mustard family have made my eyes water before .
My lord , what's wrong with you ?
You couldn't find a third like these two unless the devil himself turned into a Jew .
Nature took Helen's Cleopatra's majesty , The best of Atalanta , And unhappy Lucretia's modesty .
I'm happy about that .
Pindarus !
Is the building of your love already in ruins ?
I'm not going to eat dinner tonight .
Yes , ma'am .
And I've been avoiding him all day .
Look at my face .
Let me ask you something in private .
Where is this man ?
Well , when Nature makes a person beautiful , can't Fortune make her fall into a fire , thereby making her ugly after all ?
Two or three of us have seen strange things .
Good Enobarbus !
My lord !
Nature would produce its harvests in abundance , to feed my innocent people .
Don't worry , man , I won't try to escape .
This toast is for Lepidus !
And the poor old man just wept , mixing his tears with the rain .
I'm afraid you'll come to me again for ransom .
What foolish thief brags about his crimes ?
Who could be out of things to say if he were with the girl he loves ?
We'll bury him , and then we'll commit acts as brave and fine as any Romans , and make death proud to take us .
My lady , should I lie in your lap ?
Hymen brought her from heaven Yes , brought her here .
Yes , that's for sure .
Hear me out , my lord .
It is not courteous , you know , to assume you know my meaning before I've finished talking .
All because of what happened to that brat Rutland ?
Unleash the dogs in the western valley .
Oh , on my soul , my cousin has been slandered falsely !
Many people , men and women alike .
It won't matter .
Answer me straightforwardly .
But you're keeping a hundred knights here who are so disorderly , vulgar , and obnoxious that our noble court is starting to look like a noisy cheap hotel .
Again , goodbye .
If he wakes up before we kill him , he'll never stop punishing us .
That's true .
We're overjoyed to see you sane again .
I heard the galloping of horses .
I think I can guess what you're about to say .
You're both very precious to me .
Great happiness !
If I'm going to sing along with you , I need to know what key you're singing in .
That our clothes were drenched with sea water , but they came out looking brand-new .
Have you seen Master Lorenzo !
Who in the crowd is calling me ?
Thieves !
Be quiet for a while. , Robin , take off his donkey head. , Titania , get the fairies to play some music , and make these five people sleep more soundly than humans have ever slept before .
Don't you know he has ?
Really , are you afraid of that ?
Why do you pity him ?
Well then , don't bother .
We're sitting ducks for the French , if they only knew it , for there is no one guarding it but boys .
I do , in fact .
Farewell .
Cover the sky with a low-hanging fog , as dark as hell , and get these overeager rivals so completely lost in the woods that they can't run into each other .
I curse her .
Monstrous !
They are full of pity for Caesar .
You said she slept with Cassio .
Leave them alone , and do the murder first .
Therefore , great king , we surrender our town and lives to your kind mercy .
Gallus , you go with him .
What's going on , Othello , darling ?
The king's a dear boy with a heart of gold , he's a lively lad , a wag , born of fine parents , good with his fists .
I have sent for the strawberries .
Put on your nightgown .
Mustardseed .
Let's take up the best positions we can in the valleys .
Until then , I have to remain calm .
He is as full of courage as of kindness , princely in both .
What's the matter ?
It was a bit short , my lord .
Didn't you send Lysander , as an insult , to follow me around praising my eyes and my face ?
The wit you flaunt is like a blunt sword , it can't hurt anyone , thank God. , My lord , I thank you for your many kindnesses .
Where's America and the West Indies ?
It sure is .
Who , me ?
But since your father doesn't want him to marry you , you have to consider Demetrius to be the better man .
That's right .
He did ask for mercy .
My good lords , I plan to .
Would raise babies and clip coupons .
What if I am ?
I'm sorry , sir , but in this war I consider you a subordinate , not my equal .
Launcelot and I can't agree on anything .
Get out , you dark-skinned gypsy !
Don't get up yet .
Why , what symptoms of love does she exhibit ?
We should all kneel before her , men of Cyprus !
Oh , and monsieur , be careful not to break the honey-sac .
It isn't good for your health to expose your weak body to the raw , cold morning .
I will my lord , as fast as I can .
The same liquor that quenched their thirst has fired me up .
I'll cry at nothing , and I'll always do it when you're in a good mood .
Then learn this from me : if you have something , you have it .
Exactly right .
Yes , if you want to help yourself .
They plan to spend the night in Sardis .
But how is it possible that you still remember this , through all the darkness of the past ?
I'll be getting my own figures together in the meantime .
Did you see anything ?
Yes , very well .
What I think about this , and about what's happening here in Rome , I'll tell you later .
If I remember correctly , I can't raise the entire three thousand ducats immediately .
I swear , I think my wife's faithful , and I think she's not .
You gave that handkerchief , the one I loved and gave to you , to Cassio .
So how can anyone say I'm alone , when the whole world is here to look at me ?
I'm happy the Dauphin has such a good sense of humor .
Many times , madam .
I'll show you how .
To hell with your sword .
Actually , it's my arm .
Cough them up .
I'm dying an innocent woman .
I flashed about faster than lightning .
I'll commute your death sentence .
If I don't do all this , never trust me again .
He's laughed at my losses , made fun of my earnings , humiliated my race , thwarted my deals , turned my friends against me , riled up my enemies , and why ?
I'll follow .
I must be as stupid as an ass , that's why I don't know her , but she knows me .
In that case , if I can wear a mask , let me play Thisbe too !
That must be because you're so ambitious .
Are you a god ?
I think so too .
My forces are growing , and everything I know tells me it's all coming together .
I'm crying at how unworthy I am to give you what I want to give you and to take what I'm dying to have .
Why not ?
I think the marriage was made more for political reasons than for love .
What's this ?
So the weak third of the triumvirate is imprisoned until death frees him .
They're retreating , sir , and our superiority indicates a clear victory .
I desperately needed God's blessing , but the word "Amen" stuck in my throat .
I leave a slimy bastard with you , your Worship , for you to punish and make an example of .
No epilogue , please .
They're natural enough." I think these things are omens of things to come in our country .
Go release them , Ariel .
Therefore , willingly and yielding .
So I will , my liege .
I've heard about this indirectly , but I will send for him .
If I'd been a common laborer and hadn't taken him up on his offer , to hell with me .
But back to that argument you mentioned .
A backbiting friend , one who grabs people , who patrols the streets and passageways .
I think I hear Antony call me .
That's the point .
Her ladies-in-waiting saw her go to bed , and early this morning the bed was empty .
Are you planning to go out ?
I bet she'll chew him out .
Sir , my brother is very fond of you .
Let's sit here on the church bench until two and then go off to bed .
My God , this is unbelievably strange .
Ah , my lord , this prince is nothing like Edward !
I can't believe it .
Come on , I'll escort you to dinner .
Go into the bedroom and see for yourself .
What did you say to me ?
He's welcome here .
If you survive , I'll live .
It's about who I am , and how , why , and where this handkerchief was stained .
Get me a surgeon !
Oh , come quickly !
I swear to her that I haven't , but it doesn't change anything .
I know that , sir .
What's the prize ?
It's so scary to look down !
She was utterly true to you !
If not , then I have no powers of observation .
But what do I care about words ?
One of your tears is worth everything that was won and lost .
Oh , then you never loved as wholeheartedly as me .
My master's a total Jew .
Have you forgotten the torture I freed you from ?
You don't need it yet .
I'll sleep here until morning .
I swear I will , and if I ever break my promise let me turn into a monster .
About as long as it would take someone to count slowly to a hundred .
Who can say I mean just her when all her neighbors are exactly like her ?
I don't know .
Canidius , take our nineteen
Damn you !
No , I'll go find some ditch to die in .
Be friendly to people but don't overdo it .
Are any ships leaving tonight ?
Listen to my little story , and when it's done , oh , my heart will break !
All right then , confess and live .
Flee ?
How wonderful my master is !
His courage is hidden , and when it is revealed , it will shrink .
Why , here is the order to prove it .
Juno and Ceres are whispering about something serious .
Who asked you to call her ?
I ask you , if you have a grudge against me , to kill me now , while your stained hands still reek of blood .
Or maybe I've got a hankering for a bundle of hay .
For the love of God , be patient with him .
Do not run away .
Your Emperor is still a king among gods .
But that's just a fairy tale .
You're sick , yet you sneak out of your warm bed and let the humid and disease-infested air make you sicker ?
Was it mine ?
Your death and destiny advise your followers to escape .
Startle even the sky with the sound of your lances cracking .
He has always loved Cordelia best , and his bad judgment in disowning her now is obvious .
Why , then , it's my body's doomsday .
Oh , please don't swear , my lord of Buckingham .
Just tell me .
I'm sorry my noble brother is suspicious of me .
Make sure the ones who have wronged you suffer too .
The interest rate will be , Well , Shylock ?
Go ahead and say you don't love me , but not so bitterly .
Why ?
Take me to the edge of it , and I'll reward all your troubles with something valuable .
I've noticed that they always like to settle and mate where the air is the nicest .
Just look .
Callow youth , you don't yet know how to love !
Oh , lady , speak again .
Get going now .
What's the "seventh cause" ?
Tell Ventidius I want to speak with him .
I'm not talking about proof yet .
Friends , go .
What are you saying ?
My father and mother coupled when the demonic moon was descending , and I was born under the Big Dipper , so it's inevitable that I'm rude and oversexed .
What a poor instrument , that can do such a noble deed !
Oh , to hell with those people !
There is a river in Macedon , and there is likewise a river in Monmouth .
It's tragic because Pyramus kills himself .
I wish you and your scarred self had convinced me to wage our last battle on land .
Surely , Luciana , it's already two o'clock .
You didn't want to go then !
What else can I say ?
Noble Antony , even illness couldn't keep me away .
Pardon me ?
Where is he ?
Some of this liquor's still left in the goblet .
You can relax , ma'am .
Wake Duncan with your knocking .
Cassius , what a night this is !
I'm reluctant to tell you what I wish you knew .
What are you fighting about ?
You just said all your lines at once , cues and all. , Pyramus , enter .
Let's go , we'll obey you .
This is Trebonius .
They show their bloody heralds of battle , and something must be done immediately .
Look , he's approaching Caesar .
But who's coming ?
Mistress and master , you've often asked about that lovelorn shepherd you once saw me sitting with , the one who complained about the disdainful shepherdess he was in love with .
Please tell me , who is this man ?
I overlooked your request , but I did not deny it .
I'll go my own way .
I'll take you and your wonderful virtues here and now , if it's okay that I'm picking up what others have thrown away .
Beauty is a witch whose spells can turn loyalty into passion .
Both , both , my girl .
fast and pray to stave off temptations .
We don't have any music that can't be heard .
All to our advantage .
As long as heaven and nature extend it .
Why , sir , you know this is your wedding day .
Sometimes snakes wrap around me , hissing at me with their forked tongues till I go crazy .
Arrest me if you dare .
But , sir , Why should you do this , you want to know ?
I tell you , though , it's incredible how much she loves me .
Sir , your description of him doesn't detract from his good qualities , though I know that trying to list them all would make your head spin , and even so you wouldn't be able to keep up with him .
If you forgive my mistake , I swear I'll never break an oath with you again .
Yes , boy .
We'll drive them to a
I'd rather be a squawking bird than an animal like you .
Now , Balthazar , you've always been honest and faithful to me , and I trust you still are .
I'm glad to see your highness .
Hurry .
Eyes , do you see ?
Thank you , doctor .
And when you want to go to sleep , I'll be up laughing like a hyena .
Go !
My noble kinsman , welcome .
If our eyes were policemen , they might capture two thieves at once while we're embracing .
Why are our bodies soft and weak and smooth , unfit for toil and trouble in the world , if not so that our soft qualities and our hearts should agree with our external parts ?
I'll hire you again to go back to Rome .
You lying brat .
Go out and feel what the impoverished feel .
Macbeth has come .
The empire may be in danger if he's not restrained before he reaches his full potential .
Tell them this , Publius .
What kind of help do you need ?
First , he sends his regards .
Brutus , my lord .
Why are you calling him a jerk ?
No , let's follow him .
Transform your grief into anger .
What do you have to say to me now ?
In my imagination , Horatio .
I am friends with you all and love you all , on one condition , that you prove to me that Caesar was dangerous .
Not now , my sweet Desdemona .
I've hired five hundred almsmen to hold up their withered hands to heaven , praying for my pardon twice a day throughout the year .
This is a rotten song to sing at a man's funeral .
Come on , Desdemona , I've only got an hour of love to spend with you , to tell you what you need to do .
And that would get us all executed .
Where should we stable our horses ?
The English have promised me thousands of troops .
Though he seems a little old-fashioned , there is much care and courage in this Welshman .
I don't have anywhere to go , so I don't need to see .
Take him safely through the lines .
Some should go to the public platforms and cry out , "Liberty , freedom , and democracy ! " People and senators , don't be afraid .
Come with me , sir .
Do you remember anyone who died of it ?
Since she belongs to me , I can do what I want with her , as the law says : I can either make her marry Demetrius , or have her killed .
I'll trust my determination and my hands , but none of Caesar's men .
What's your name , please , friend ?
Very well , thank you .
You'll see that Caesar is giving you no reason to do so .
And thus I let you go and give you to the gods .
I'm the one who , I'll get right on that .
Your son will have my consent to marry my daughter .
If you prick us with a pin , don't we bleed ?
Don't snap at me .
All the perfumes of Arabia couldn't make my little hand smell better .
Oh , good judge !
Launcelot , what's going on ?
If it takes all the wine in my bottle , I'll cure him .
Yet he seems capable .
What's the matter ?
Listen .
Cicero , I've seen storms in which the angry winds split old oak trees , and I've seen the ocean swell , rage , and foam , as if it wanted to reach the storm clouds , but never before tonight , never until now , have I experienced a storm that drops fire .
And I'll neigh like a horse and bark like a hound and grunt like a pig and roar like a bear and burn like a fire at every turn .
Oh , damn her , damn her !
But for a fine , elegant , graceful , and excellent dress , yours is worth ten of those .
Go hide , Adam , and you'll hear how he abuses me .
But I didn't want you to think that I'm hasty in my emotions .
Poor Tom , your cup is empty .
Goodbye , old friend .
And if I , your poor devoted servant , may ask you for one small favor , you will guarantee my happiness forever .
What would you like me to do ?
Help !
But why did you tempt the heavens like that ?
Is it a beggar ?
Damn it , who's there ?
If it pleases your Majesty , it is the token of a man I must fight with , if he's still alive .
Your complaint against me is perfectly understandable , but I still insist I've done everything I could to help you .
You may really be honest , no matter what I think .
That's true , lieutenant .
My God !
Caesar's sister is named Octavia .
He said "Goodbye , madam , " and nothing else .
You barely have the heart to tell me , so you can't possibly have the nerve to do it .
Well , well , well .
Ill will never prompted anything well said .
I will .
No , by Saint Jamy , I'll bet you a penny !
But you're all wound up about fashion , too .
You knew that my sword , weakened by my love for you , would obey that love no matter what .
I will not take it .
If you pursue it , this strict court of Venice will need to carry out the sentence against the merchant there .
He couldn't be a lion if the Romans weren't such easy prey .
Pardon me , but I'm just repeating what you yourself have said .
Let me play the lion too .
Maybe you think that I think you're in love .
The Tower's chaplain has buried them , but to tell you the truth , I don't know where .
Fair sister , will you go with the princes or stay here with me ?
You who are wicked beyond belief , the only "explanation" I'll accept from you is for you to hang yourself .
Cobble you , sir .
Go quickly , hurry , to the castle , for I've given orders to have Lear and Cordelia killed .
Both you and the king might have ordered us to execute your command , instead of asking us so politely .
And you , sir , had me arrested over that necklace .
I'm not sleepy at all .
Are those my tents on fire ?
Will we hear from you before bedtime , Catesby ?
You mean the man who used to be Othello ?
So stop hoping and wondering what I mean .
If I owe you anything , I'll pay you in clubbings .
Yes , but the clerk will never do it , unless he grows up to be a man .
Are you my daughter ?
Why do people love you ?
I've been dishonored : I arranged for a friend of mine to marry a common whore .
Your renowned uncle , Duke Menaphon , the famous soldier , brought me here .
In the time since he left Egypt , he could have traveled an even longer distance .
Here .
Ha !
An excellent motion .
Was that him just now ?
Where are you taking me ?
Yes , in a very gentlemanly way .
Oh , oh !
Come , let's go to the dance .
When are you getting married , madam ?
We'll have to think about it carefully .
Let's go , then !
He was covered with blood from his helmet to his spurs .
By the way , if I were to compose an extra speech of twelve to sixteen lines and stick it into the play , you could learn it by heart for tomorrow , right ?
If not , goodbye .
And you have mercy on me too !
Oh , Cassio , Cassio , Cassio !
That's why you sleep so soundly .
Well that's good .
If that's true , it makes up for all the sorrows I've ever known .
I don't like her name .
I would choose to take my penalty .
Oh , grief has transformed me since the last time you saw me .
Well , good night .
Therefore you must run , noble Cassius .
If he breaks the peace , he ought to enter into a quarrel with fear and trembling .
But here comes Antony. , Welcome , Mark Antony .
I am the duke who loved your father .
The coroner's inquest law .
Why are you treating my sister like this ?
I'll keep my promise just as if you really were Rosalind .
Come on !
I am a gentleman of a company .
I'd like to sing my song solo .
Come , come .
I won't play the fool anymore and just cry while my husband and his man laugh at me .
No , you shall not .
The only glory princes have are their titles .
I hope some will fall off tomorrow .
Why did you send me out , brave Cassius ?
Terrible .
Here's what you'll do .
Be quiet and depart .
Who's sleeping in the second chamber ?
Whoever is born on a day I forget to send a message to Antony will die a beggar .
Oh , royal Caesar !
That's all there is to it .
It's pointless to talk now .
You devil , you've put a spell on her !
What do you think will be the result of this storm ?
No , my lord , I didn't see anything .
So , please , my lord , don't assume that I'm treacherous just because I'm poor , with no titles to my name .
I heard myself declared an outlaw and escaped capture by hiding in the trunk of a hollow tree .
Here's another jacket to say thanks .
Well , good-bye , Portia .
You've already stained our sheets with your lust ; now I'll stain them with your whore's blood .
No .
Don't stay to answer me , get going .
But a dream itself is just a shadow .
This wicked son of mine confirms the prediction , son against father .
What , are we playing with interjections ?
Thisbe ?
When a great person departs , it causes more pain than when the soul leaves the body .
It's your turn now .
I'd like to think all men have some hope .
Now my friend Petruchio will help me out , presenting me to old Baptista as a schoolmaster for Bianca well-versed in music .
This is no place for you ; this home is now a slaughterhouse .
Yes !
What do you think I should do ?
Put out the light of the candle , and then put out the light of her heart .
You're a natural-born philosopher !
It is , my lord .
And you can do poor things that lead to rich results .
Give them hefty meals of beef and iron and steel , and they will eat like wolves and fight like devils .
Tell him that when our noble father , the duke of York , gave his three sons his blessing , he never imagined that our friendship would come to this .
And then his clerk , who went to a lot of trouble with the writing , begged for mine .
So-so" is good , very good , an excellent answer .
No , come on , don't make me play a woman .
Farewell , farewell .
And my sweet master , I received no gold .
There's a cliff there that leans precariously over the deep sea .
Look , I don't love you , so stop following me around .
A million goodbyes to you .
Will you come to bed , my lord ?
In this day and age , if a man doesn't erect his own monument before he dies , he won't be remembered past the funeral bell's ringing and his widow's crying .
Remember to see me today .
Oh , what a villain !
Rulers abuse their power when they separate it from compassion .
The whole world wants her .
I don't want anything more .
Then God be praised , it Petruchio , do whatever you like .
Do you carry a pike ?
I can tell your Majesty , the duke is a brave man .
Kate is as straight and slender as a hazel-twig , her hair as brown as hazelnut shells , and she herself sweeter than the kernels .
After you , my lords ?
If even then they don't answer to your satisfaction , you can say that they're not the men you thought they were .
Who's that ?
Gertrude , don't drink that .
So you want to put a man in your belly .
have lost , and the indignity we have endured , for which he is too insignificant to sufficiently pay us back .
And you won't tell me who you are ?
You need to learn what ants know well about winter , there's no point in slaving away if there's no hope for profit .
I'm being called .
That's it , I'm done .
You sell fish .
No , add a couple more syllables .
If he's so sad and solemn when he's young , I can only imagine how much he'll cry as an old man .
I admit that he's murderous , lecherous , greedy , lying , deceitful , violent , malicious , and guilty of every sin that has a name .
Our era should be ashamed !
Well , if a moist palm isn't a clear sign of promiscuity , then I can't scratch my own ear .
When it comes to defense , it's best to assume that the enemy is more powerful than he seems .
How are you , your highness ?
Keep an eye on her .
How do you both plead ?
I look forward to getting to know you better .
Excellent .
I doubt you'd thank me in the end , but she's rich , all right , very rich .
I'll change that name for you .
Tell me , who is this knight ?
Goodbye to my happiness !
Oh , your contemptible lady !
I'll bet you a hundred marks , my Kate puts her flat on her back .
Goneril , you aren't worth the dust the wind blows in your face .
I wish my father could see them with my eyes .
Then , hold my sword and turn your face away while I run on it .
Where's Dolabella ?
Here .
Your fortunes are the same .
No , not at all .
I serve the king , who sent me here .
It's a long story , and tough to listen to .
I'm Sir Rowland's middle son , and I bring you news .
What do you mean , "in a strange way" ?
I can tell that something wicked is coming by the tingling in my thumbs .
Why did you leave the dining room ?
Tell me , if your dark powers can see this far : will Banquo's sons ever reign in this kingdom ?
They're overdoing it .
They should advance immediately , because I sense Octavius's side is a bit fainthearted right now , and a sudden push would overthrow him .
These are a man's words , and his handwriting .
May God bring you sleep !
Who's this ?
Stop eating ?
Don't put me in the stocks .
In a king , the sight is unbearable .
But his ambition , for that , I killed him .
Give me some applause , if we're friends , and Robin will make everything up to you .
The life" ?
It's entirely possible .
I'll fight every one of these devils if I have to , one at a time .
Beautifully , sir , beautifully !
Good day to you , Captain Fluellen .
Why , mistress , my master is as angry as a bull with horns .
In cash .
Doesn't that rising blush suggest that she is virtuous and innocent ?
Your sweet brother wanted to come meet you , but his mother wouldn't let him .
It's almost five o'clock .
Even if she's ugly , she'll be smart enough to find a guy to sleep with her .
It's mine and I'm going to get it .
Okay , but tonight doesn't count .
I have another plan to make my bird come to me and recognize her owner's call is to keep her from sleeping ,
In his ignorant jealousy , he'll totally misunderstand Cassio's smiles , gestures , and jokes. , How are you , lieutenant ?
Help , my lord of Norfolk , help , help !
You won't be seeing anything. , Hold his chair still , men. , I'm going to put my foot on his eyes .
Come at me in the form of a rugged Russian bear , an armor-plated rhinoceros , or a tiger from Iran .
Oh !
What's that good for ?
Do you love me ?
Here comes young Mr. Ganymede , my new mistress's brother .
Richard , the duke of Gloucester , hates you .
Titinius , if you love me , get on your horse and spur him on until he's brought you to those troops and back again , so that I can find out whether those troops are friends or enemies .
I can .
It'll go away .
If you're Launcelot , then you're my own flesh and blood .
I was bound to him an hour ago , sir , but thankfully he chewed through our ropes .
He speaks roughly , but what he says is smart , and his roughness makes other people enjoy listening to him .
Nothing , sir , except grandchildren .
You can do what you want , but he's an experienced and honorable soldier .
I know you know something about how excellent Laertes is ,
My uncle Clarence's angry ghost .
And so I said to my daughter : "Lord Hamlet is a prince , he's out of your league .
I'm going to find some shade and sigh until he returns .
I really don't know .
But will it be soon ?
That Lodovico is a good-looking man .
That's the one : Leonato's Hero , your Hero , every man's Hero .
Thank you for saying that .
These are gracious tears .
Be at ease .
And then ?
He wants to eat the English .
Which one of them did it ?
So you're saying you're not a whore ?
And this is what you told me he said : that he beat you and pretended his house wasn't his and I wasn't his wife .
Farewell .
Is it true that good King Edward has died ?
Banquo !
So be cheerful .
It's time that we brought our armies into the field .
It would make any man as mad as a bull to be betrayed like this .
Good roaring , Lion !
What do you have to say for yourself , Hermia ?
Is that you , Diomedes ?
Yes , I'll grant you that .
But how did you want it made ?
Stop it , I order you .
Come with me , I'll show you , and along the way , you can tell me where you live .
My name's Roderigo .
One ?
Come , come , you're making fun of me .
I'll leave you for now .
If this letter's right , you've got a lot to deal with .
So get down on your knees and beg mercy from the duke .
Say , uncle Richard , if my brother comes , where will I stay till my coronation ?
Do you want to get married , fool ?
That's impossible .
Give him this deed and have him sign it .
You must not go without having a drink first .
Will you say grace , sweet Kate , or shall I ? , What is this ?
It would make him curse the heavens and be damned to hell .
You go and talk to the duke so he won't notice I'm helping the king .
Lighten up .
Come on , let me wipe your face .
You can judge for yourself what I mean .
Brother , Duke , please have some food .
On a night like this !
But there are many herbs that will help him rest and take his mind off his anguish for a while .
Now , Eros .
No more , no more .
If she wants to be proud , or "honest , " as she calls it , she can just marry her own pride .
Are you his friend ?
I humbly thank you .
Heaven help him !
Now , Charmian !
That's just what I thought .
The reason I think he's insane , besides the way he just acted , is that he told a senseless story over lunch about being locked out of his own house .
I held the sword and he ran on it .
If the future turns out as I hope it will , I'm all set for success .
Do promise , Kate , that you'll do your French part to bring forth such a boy ; and for my English half , take the word of a king and a bachelor .
He likes me , and I've given him good reason to .
But Antonio's certainly ruined .
We'll bring him to his house with shouts and celebration !
I swear , somehow the fool has been cheated out of all my money .
I intend to be flesh and blood , not airy philosophy , for there has never yet been a philosopher who could endure a toothache patiently , even though they all write as if they had risen above human suffering and misfortune .
I think I can find him .
Stay invisible .
Do you have your answer yet ?
His soul is as dull as night and dark as the underworld .
All the rest of the conspirators acted out of jealousy of great Caesar .
The sentence I've passed down on her is firm and unshakeable .
I would've been happy if the whole army had had sex with her , the lowest-ranking grunts and all , as long as I didn't know anything about it .
Oh , how wonderful to see you !
Seek !
Good friend , " he said , "say that the faithful Roman sends an oyster's treasure to the great Queen of Egypt , and that he plans to enhance this meager gift by adding new kingdoms to her empire .
It is the best horse in Europe .
No , advancement to the dignity and height of honor , to a high , imperial kind of glory .
You don't know my voice ?
So goodbye until we meet again .
Forgive me .
I told him that your father was in Venice , and that you expected him to arrive in Padua today .
Stand away from the hearse .
His highness is not well .
I'm making a kind offer , zero percent financing .
Now I'm alone .
Who's there ?
Yes , my lord .
Now all the young men of England are inspired and have stored their party clothes in the closet .
There'll be hell to pay for this .
If I see anything tonight that convinces me not to marry her , I'll shame her tomorrow in the very congregation where I would have married her .
The gods forbid !
So farewell , all , for my tongue has almost finished with its life .
When grown-ups teach little children , they do it gently and easily .
Though the truth of your treachery is as plain as black on white , I can scarcely believe it , it's so past understanding .
Should we all give up and drown ?
But you're lying out in the cold .
But let me place this wreath on your head .
But if your soles are worn out , I can mend you .
So , if all turns out fine , as you say , it's more than we deserve or I expect .
Ugly , wrinkled witch , what are you doing here ?
Signor Antonio , you've often insulted my money and my business practices in the Rialto .
Better late than never , and it's never too late to change .
Of course , sir .
No more than I do yours .
I don't know what you mean by that , but I'm sure Caesar fell down .
And her sister's dead too , poisoned by your wife .
Of course he is , and so are you .
Oh , young and noble Cato , have you been slain ?
Get it , sister .
Listen to my reasons and be silent so you can hear .
You hit my servants , and your disorderly mob of knights treat their superiors like servants .
Goodbye .
Before you make My lord , you could really help me out now .
I've made a risky investment .
He did , and I gave it to him .
Do you like her , Claudio ?
Read it , Mark Antony .
Signior Benedick !
I hope this explanation will stand as my excuse .
But who's that coming this way ?
The first time we see the world as newborns , we cry and scream .
True , noble prince .
I'm really a pitiful singer .
Two or three more lords and ladies have been married too .
His name is Tyrrel , my lord .
Well , at least that's something .
Ha !
You were right the first time .
Here , Peter Quince .
A very clear way , but there is no friend who will undertake it .
All right .
I haven't eaten today .
No .
Go bring them all here ; I give you power over them .
You did , not just once or twice , but twenty times .
Let's go , Menas .
It is .
My lord , I'll say goodbye now .
It's always better to get rid of what you're scared of than to be afraid .
Didn't I meet up with your allies ?
Then we'll go out , even to the marketplace , and , waving our bloody swords over our heads , let's cry , "Peace , freedom , and liberty ! " Kneel then , and wash .
Listen , listen !
What an enormous thing for us to forget ! , Edmund , tell us , where's the king ?
May the gods destroy you !
Where's my father ?
Your grace , please forgive me .
Please , tell me some of them .
You'd have to be as lazy as a weed on the shores of I knew it !
Nothing , Messala .
There'd be no marriage ?
The man who finds the sweetest rose Will be pricked by it , and by Rosalind .
I'll follow you .
Keep me balanced and sane .
The Queen is here , my lord .
Nature , I don't accuse your weather of unkindness .
Let us prepare for our wedding. , On that day , I'll take your oath of loyalty , my Lord of Burgundy and all my peers , to guarantee my treaty .
Let me say "amen" quickly , before the devil comes in and stops my prayer , because here comes the devil , disguised as a Jew .
It's dangerous out there .
The king is not responsible for it .
My good qualities , my legal status as Desdemona's husband , and my innocence will protect me .
Yes , if a woman grows up to be a man .
I loved Ophelia .
Good Ursula , go wake my cousin and ask her to get up .
I'll ask him for my position back again , and he'll tell me I'm a drunk .
But truly , if I were as
Are you acting so boldly from hardship or because you despise good manners ?
Hearts can not think it , tongues can not speak it , meas-urements can not calculate it , scribes can not write it , bards can not sing it , and poets can not make verses about it .
Do you know Fluellen ?
My Lord High Constable , the English lie within fifteen hundred paces of your tents .
I curse him , but he loves me .
That man always looks so sour !
I beg your pardon , sirs. , Please tell me your name , sir ?
You're perfect , without a rival in the world , made up of the best qualities of every creature .
Did you just call me "beautiful" ?
Why , Fool ?
Plantagenet .
Why should he have followed you ?
Please spare my innocent wife and children ! , Kind warden , please stay with me for a while .
Man , they were asking for it .
If you fight to protect your wives , your wives will welcome you home as conquerors .
They were traitors .
I have been sent on ahead to light a fire , and they are coming after to warm themselves .
Yes , if that would be all right with your Lordship .
But thinking like this won't help me choose a husband .
I would , if I had a mirror .
A little before twelve , I think .
You know , you're right .
It's stopped now , it must be played for some local god of the island .
We're near his room now .
Now go , leave me .
I mean knock his brains out , so he can't take Othello's place .
You had rotten food , and he helped you eat it .
You've said what you have to say now .
The good manners of the court look as silly in the country as country behavior is laughable at the court .
Let me tell you , friends ,
But if I were smart enough to get out of this forest , I'd be wise enough to satisfy myself .
I'd deny whatever evidence you had against me , even if it were in my own handwriting , and turn it all into evidence against you and your plans for treachery .
Sir , enter the castle .
Yes , if I'm still alive , and you're still sane , and your dinner is worth eating .
Anyway , my conscience says , "Stay put." "Go , " the devil says .
Really , my lord , why are you so excessively sad ?
Well , sir , it's better to say little than to be tedious .
Yes , I am the one .
I'll steal away to England , and I'll steal some more when I get there .
It's best just to let him go .
Believe me , my friend , since I have the power to stop the prosecutors .
I'll do as you say , father .
We're sorry to hear this .
From a certain knight who swore on his honor that the pancakes he was eating were good , and that the mustard on top of them , he swore on his honor , was bad .
If he's been spending his leisure time in lustful pursuits , then he'll be punished with venereal diseases , and that's his business .
But since this has happened , you should fix it for your own good .
This diamond is a present from him to your wife for her boundless hospitality .
Isn't every living thing condemning her ?
Sir , welcome to our house .
Ha , ha , ha !
Not being the worst daughter deserves some praise , I guess .
Don't say no .
Me too , I swear .
That's no lie .
That's why there must be space between you .
Before the bat flies through the castle , and before the dung beetle makes his little humming noise to tell us it's nighttime , a dreadful deed will be done .
Thank you , sir .
Well she was , good Curtis , before this frost .
He won't see my face ever again .
You know the law .
Please wait , sir .
Get lost !
But you don't love me .
Let us hear him .
My lord , when I first saw him I thought he was your daughter's brother .
All right , now I'm starting to lose my cool .
I've only given the articles a cursory glance .
I hope you're not drowned .
Grant their law-abiding request !
Listen , listen to what I say : whoever strikes first , I'll run him through with my sword , as sure as I'm a soldier .
Oh , dear !
Let me go with him .
Didn't he say my brother has run away ?
I don't know you .
But God forgive me for bragging .
If it's true that you don't need
The night's too rough for humans to bear .
Are you trying to remake me ?
When a great leader dies he doesn't die alone but , like a whirlpool , draws others with him .
Hey , if I lay down my " Welcome , Lorenzo and Salerio .
I know your position .
My lord , that dirty clown whom you laughed at so often is also missing .
Oh , now I really need that priest who spoke to me today !
Then let's go in and hear what he has to say , though I think I can guess before the Frenchman has uttered a word .
Maud , Bridget , Marian , Ciceley , Gillian , Ginn !
I mean what I say .
I will be angry .
Some of you go to Decius's house and some to Casca's .
The note is a big fat liar if it says I said so .
Isn't she a well-mannered young lady ?
Who here is so vile that he doesn't love his country ?
And so I'm dying .
You have my friendship .
Is that possible ?
Give me your hand , and explain your situation to me .
You .
Ha ?
Oh , Cleopatra !
The world has become so bad that now little wrens have settled where eagles used to roost .
The next bit of good news is that our ship , which we gave up for ruined only three hours ago , is as well-outfitted and seaworthy as it was when we first set sail .
Where is your husband ?
That's what you get for marrying Christian husbands .
Go ahead , you fool .
Since you know all this is true , why do you blame me for loving you ?
As a child , he took such a long time to grow up that , according to his rule , he should have grown up into a gracious adult .
I don't know , ma'am .
You corrupt judge , why did you let her escape ?
Our troops are deployed tomorrow .
If I weren't a merciful man , I'd forget about your missing brother and punish you in his place .
Don't be sad that this happened because of you , because Lady Luck's been nicer to me than usual .
They come from the four corners of the earth to kiss this shrine and see this living , breathing saint .
I would like to prove to you that I am .
I know you'll offer nothing less than that .
Then my children will probably be illegitimate .
They intend to challenge us here at Philippi , responding to our challenge before we've even challenged him .
That's the way to do it !
Princes travel across deserts and the vast wilderness of Arabia to come see the beautiful Portia .
What he just said to me , it's alright .
So I can sleep away the time while my Antony is gone .
Then if they're negligent , we could control them .
There are rats and thieves and pirates , not to mention storms , winds , and rocks .
Call the messengers !
What time is it ?
Look , here's where Cassius's dagger pierced it .
Here's to you , Menas .
I'll be your wife if you'll have me .
She wants to have a word with you in her bedroom before you go to bed .
So were their daggers , which we found on their pillows , unwiped .
If the witches tell the truth , which they did about you , maybe what they said about me will come true too .
Would you mind if we woke up the king ?
My beautiful Rosalind , I'm only an hour late .
I will sit here in the middle .
I think the best sign of intelligence will soon be silence , and talking will only be a good thing for parrots to do .
I don't think you've got much of a reason to love me .
If so , you'd be buying them to sell again .
Wait , countrymen .
I even knew the tailor who made the disguise she wore when she ran off .
She has betrayed me and shall die .
I pick the younger one .
God bless your Worship !
The other half goes to the state .
A victory in battle is twice as victorious when all the soldiers return home safely .
But the really unbelievable thing is , and this is incredible , As most unbelievable things are .
You pretty lovers are lucky you met me here .
My lord , I won't miss it .
Oh , really ?
Grandmother , this would have been a biting joke .
I'm off to visit my friends in Padua , particularly my best friend Hortensio .
Oh , let her live , and I'll ruin her manners and her beauty .
He's late .
If you stop up the keyhole , it will escape from the chimney along with the smoke .
Come here , man .
Call the Duke of Burgundy .
We're strangers here .
Now , my friendly servant , thank you .
Come , ask me to do anything for you .
His counselors will govern as long as he's a minor , and then he'll take over .
You've got something for me ?
Oh , sad day !
Besides , according to the French historians , King Pepin , who deposed Childeric , based his own claim to the crown of France on his descent from Blithild , the daughter of King Clothair .
I'm very uncomfortable , and that won't help my case .
He brought many captives home to Rome whose ransoms brought wealth to the city .
Let's go , Nerissa. ,
It can not be .
Will you come immediately ?
I think he got his jacket in Italy , his tights in France , his hat in Germany , and his behavior everywhere .
This imaginary suitor for Katherina , I'd buy him the best horse in Padua if he'd get here quickly , woo her , marry her , take her to bed , and rid the house of her .
Get it ready immediately .
Do you think so ?
If this isn't what you've been hoping for , I have no more to say except that you ought to say goodbye to Bianca forever .
Madam , here comes your husband .
All women would be angry with you for doing it , even though I'm the only one who's hurt by it .
I want to hear more about this .
Just now we put him in the abbey over here , and now he's over there .
Here he comes .
I swear by the sun that when I leave here , it will be as your faithful servant .
Oh Buckingham , now I'm going to test to see if you're truly made of gold .
Go back with her ?
That blind head of yours was created to make me rich .
You have some plea for Caesar , don't you ?
Death didn't conquer
Is he really married ?
Many men use that excuse to avoid giving gifts .
So give me your answer , and we'll shake on it .
The hour has almost come when I have to return to the horrible flames of purgatory .
I don't know , madam .
Well , we've missed the beginning ; it's dead and buried .
But have you put the love juice from the flower on the eyes of that Athenian , as I asked you to do ?
My lord , the mayor of London is here to greet you .
Whatever seems best to you .
I do indeed , my lord .
to wage war .
I'll look into it further .
Nothing else , for God's sake !
Go on , tell it .
He's standing ready outside the door .
It's arranged .
My God , it's nauseating !
Yes , if the devil tempts you to do good .
Brutus will lead , and we'll follow him with the boldest and best hearts of Rome .
Yes , sir .
Damn it , this isn't funny .
All right , you've had your say , but we'll let the forest judge whether or not you spoke wisely .
Block up my house's ears , I mean the windows .
Alexander , God knows and you know , in his rages and his furies and his wraths and his angers and his moods and his displeasures and his indignations , and also being a little the worse for drink , killed his best friend Cleitus in a drunken rage , see .
Is it possible dat I sould love de enemy of France ?
I'm the king himself .
I'll have my head cut from my shoulders before I'll see the crown so misplaced .
Now I'm starting to pity Titania for being so infatuated .
Let's look in his pockets .
Yes , indeed , and all the King's men , the Duke of Milan and his fine son too .
Harry le Roy .
Didn't you say something ?
I kiss his dirty shoe , and from the bottom of my heart I love the lovely boy .
It's hard to see clearly in the dark of night , but it's easier to hear well .
My God , she can't be a Jew , she's too nice !
That was nothing .
I don't trust you .
Yes , I am .
Here's to your health .
What's her name ?
I will , Caesar .
That he had sex with you .
What hope is that , may I ask ?
So Litio's out of the picture .
Catch me if you can !
Let's go !
Also , you're supposed to visit all the bars and tell anyone who's drunk to go home and go to bed .
Your sister's the better soldier of the two .
Richard Earl of Cambridge , I arrest you for high treason .
I can't do everything I want to , but I'll help you as well as I can .
When I ran into this holy man , those men you mentioned did come to mind , in fact .
Believe what ?
My services are at your command .
That will be a good thing .
What about Falconbridge , that young English baron ?
He would have ?
Wait for me there .
Who's coming with her ?
It will be made even heavier soon , by the weight of a man .
Endless greed and lust in a man's nature is a kind of tyranny .
If I'm lying , then
Let me go .
Oh , yes , we could , sir .
But what a fool I am to stand here chatting when I should bid good morning to my bride and seal the bargain with a loving kiss .
No , because my manly heart is grieving .
What did you think about that French lord , Monsieur le Bon ?
What do you say ?
No !
I think I hear them .
Yeah , so ?
How did you like the young German , the duke of Saxony's nephew ?
Which he'll shove down our throats the way pigeons feed their young .
Did he ask about me ?
If we let crimes like this happen , slaves and heathens will be our rulers .
My beautiful warrior !
This last course here is for closing up the stomach after great feasting .
But if I am myself , then I know for sure that your weeping sister is not my wife .
What is this news about ?
No , monster , not me .
A friend .
This play isn't right for you .
He feels the need to grace all his other tramps with his presence while I sit at home starving for a smile from him .
Does Leonato have a son , my lord ?
Well then , I know who you are .
Will you wait awhile ?
A husband ?
He spends most of his time with the good , noble Claudio .
I'm ready and waiting. , Give me your hand , Bassanio .
I'll wait for you in your cave , where you can tell me what you need from me .
And Rosencrantz !
But it can't help either !
Damn it all !
Each of you , give me your bloody hand .
When an evil thing has been lost , no one cries .
Didn't feel like it ?
Lepidus is red in the face .
So , where's my wife ?
When you just want to eat , it's better to do that at home .
Her husband , you rascal .
No , he's in Florence .
We are fortunate in the change .
No , I'll slit the nose of the villain who would have sent me to jail .
Oh , madam , my old heart is broken , broken .
Within the next three days I want to hear you tell me that Cassio's dead .
My name is Pistol .
Has it come to this ?
If so , when it's day , where are you going to find a cave dark enough to hide your monstrous face ?
God be good to you !
The king has agreed to every point : first his daughter , then everything else , as you strictly proposed .
He's in They say he cried out against sherry .
I can tell you're furious , but I don't understand what you're saying .
I found him here , Beating ?
And they've got their swords unsheathed !
I've lurked in the shadows here to watch the downfall of my enemies .
I know I ought to obey my husband , but not now .
I'll go ahead of you , sir .
We're all waiting for the revenge !
Yes , yes .
When courage consumes reason , it destroys its only weapon .
I think she'll be a better soldier .
Why , so did you .
There was a kind of war in my brain that wouldn't let me sleep .
I go , Caesar .
When fools cry , you remain stony .
No , let them go .
You mock an ancient tradition , born of reverence and worn in honor of brave men who have died , and then have the gall not to stand by your words .
I'll moan very believably. , Name the other actors. , But I'm really in the mood to play a tyrant .
Once more I come to ask you , King Harry , if you're ready to negotiate your ransom before your certain defeat .
With God's help .
Fool , speak well of yourself .
He's full of wise sayings and up-to-the-minute anecdotes : that's the way he plays his part .
Ambition shouldn't be so soft .
I mean , what do the words say ?
Shut the doors after you .
Then run away .
Give me your blessing .
He's his homeland's jewel .
Hero , the daughter and heir of Leonato .
You are building your nest in
Here's some more news coming in .
I was sent for a rope !
Do so .
But suppose I did all the things you named out of love for her .
You need not kneel to me .
A wonderful miracle !
She has royal blood .
Yes , and she was mild too .
Come on in , con man .
Oh , you should have done it without telling me !
Oh , if you only knew how close to success you are , even while you make fun of what I'm telling you !
You're thought to be the most
I could do it myself .
I assure your majesty I'm only doing my duty both to my God and my good king .
First kiss me , Kate , and then we will .
Oh , how stupid !
But what's the joke ?
I have to eat my dinner now .
Here is the money .
Stop right there , sir .
Answer me this , please : where's the money I gave you ?
I'll run , devil .
It's absolutely true , so take good care of it .
I think he really is angry .
Welcome .
It's noble Kent , your friend .
Of course we will .
No offense taken .
Nice to see you again , Horatio , that is your name , right ?
Bolstered by righteousness , I prepared to fight , and when he saw my excitement , or perhaps because my shouting scared him , he ran away suddenly .
When he wakes up !
I beg your pardon , I thought it was me whom you were calling all those terrible names .
Your physical health matters more than your reputation .
Well , I'm glad that everything has been sorted out .
I've said what I have to say .
Too bad it's spoiling our pleasure tonight .
He's gone , and his wife's dead .
That's the right answer , it shows your love .
Is that the man ?
How did he get such an idea ?
That's old news .
I can't tell who's who .
My lord , if you have a free moment , I have a message from His Majesty .
These recent eclipses of the sun and moon don't bode well for us .
And so he fainted .
When you free your children from the sword , your grandchildren will repay you in your old age .
I've heard a lot more .
Yes , sir .
I wish I had never seen it !
I would not .
I don't really understand what you mean .
I'll hide behind the tapestry to hear what they say .
I wish I'd been there .
He's safe , Antony .
Antonio , I married a woman as dear to me as life itself .
Quick , quick .
My king says this : "Tell Harry of England : though we appeared dead , we were only asleep .
It's wrong for the duke to do this .
But here comes a scoundrel who says he saw me at the marketplace and that I beat on him , told him I'd given him a thousand marks in gold , and then lied about my wife and my house .
Friends , come here .
Welcome , my lord .
Be quiet , boy , or you'll lose your mind .
He might have treated me like that , because I'm as unused to abuse as a little child .
Yes , sir , it's all too true , God help us .
And here's my mistress , Titania .
What , are you afraid ?
I did kill her .
Don't you agree that we owe it to him to tell him about this , out of duty and love ?
Come on , another stanza , is that what you call 'em , "stanzas" ?
I wish I could live longer .
Stop Harry of England , who is now sweeping through our land with banners drenched in the French blood he spilled at Harfleur .
But you had bad blood in you , no matter how much you learned , and good people couldn't stand to be near you .
Now go and get me some booze .
Whose was it ?
Go on .
Gentlemen , we won't stay here and anger you further .
A friend would never see those faults .
Spirit , did you carry out the storm just as I ordered ?
I bet my life some evil busybody , some meddling , lying jerk made up this rumor to get some position .
Go to bed right this minute .
I remember a fight , but not why we were fighting .
Yes , and one other place , if you'll only let me name it .
Listen !
You can argue as much as you like when there's nothing else to do .
The sun glints off our armor .
That's how intense things like love are quickly destroyed .
Put him within the reach of my sword , and if he escapes , may heaven forgive him as well !
Please , father , since you're weak , act like it .
I wouldn't be the villain you think I am even if I were offered all of Macbeth's kingdom and the riches of the East too .
The Duke's in a meeting ?
Tell me .
Officer , I'll take the responsibility from you , and the blame too .
If not , you can kill me .
And if they don't find charity there , they find it someplace else .
Where is he ?
Young man , excuse me , how do I get to the Jew's ?
We should rip off your man's clothing and show the world the woman who has represented her own kind so badly .
In two months , a month before this loan is due , I expect to earn more than three times that much from my investments .
Good Enobarbus , consider yourself my guest as long as you're here .
Do they come from good families ?
Look , here comes our honored hostess !
A piece of ice .
Leonato's daughter had told us everything .
We'll burn Brutus's house .
My heart is ten times lighter than my looks .
Set it down .
And a true lover of the holy Church .
I wish she'd never let you come .
I'd wager twenty times as much on my wife .
If any ships are sailing , I'll get right on one .
What my lord said I was .
A loud-mouthed , drunken monster .
Don't look so sour .
You'll discover that his youthful follies were like the persona that Well , you're wrong , my Lord High Constable .
Oh , dear .
You've done well at sea .
We'll mutiny .
But as for this ring , please excuse me .
Get out of here quickly !
When this wood burns , it'll weep for making you tired .
Hold your peace .
Yes , if your memories do you no good .
What's this , my lord ?
Oh , she's ten times nicer than her father is mean , and he's the height of crabbiness .
Look , it's waving me over again .
His spirits are listening to me , but I can't help cursing him anyway .
She looks like she's washing her hands .
I can't speak any more .
And I think she's at least thirty .
Like that .
No , no , I can't , really .
Give me your hand .
Will they stop working when their voices mature ?
We'll meet at the giant oak tree in the duke's forest .
I'm ashamed that I yielded to them .
We're ruined !
Sir , sir , calm down .
Tell me where you've stowed away my money , or I swear I'll break that comical head of yours for goofing when I'm not in the mood .
Why , do you know of any harm intended toward him ?
I've told her father , and he's given his permission .
What other rites are you going to give her ?
We want answers .
Woman , stop your frantic curses and false prophesies before we run out of patience and do something bad to you .
I'd rather go without the money .
I don't know any fancy ways of talking about love , only to say right out , "I love you." If you press me any further than with the question , "Do you really ? " my love scene is over .
Let tornadoes spew water until the steeples of our churches and the weathervanes are all drowned .
If I could make things better by lying , I'd deny it .
What's your name ?
The kind that tells you that the Moor is having sex with your daughter right now .
But it's true , I don't want to get all mushy and go on and on , but the good Antonio , the honest Antonio , oh , if I only had a title good enough to match his ! , Come on , get to the point .
Three thousand ducats .
Now , what kind of entertainment do we have to fill up the long three hours between dinner and bedtime ?
Signor Antonio ?
No rescue for me ?
And if you're not as attentive in serving him as you used to be , that'll be good .
You worthless man !
They would like me to be as familiar with men's pockets as their gloves and handkerchiefs , which goes against my manhood , because to take something from another's pocket and put it into my own is plain stealing .
And the greatest sorrow is mine too .
The king of Naples , my arch-enemy , listens to my brother's request , which was that the king , in exchange for the respect and money paid to him , would get rid of me and make my brother Duke of Milan instead .
We're to be married on Sunday .
I've got news , boys , the war's over !
I don't know what to say .
A witty if a cynical reply .
What bond do we need other than that of discreet Romans who have said what they're going to do and won't back down ?
Those trumpets are calling us in to dinner .
But this storm in my mind keeps me from feeling anything except what's tormenting me , how ungrateful my children are !
Let's not , Brutus .
No , my lord , your polite words are not to the point .
I'd like you to , see , because you don't like it , and because it isn't to your taste , and because it doesn't agree with you .
That's five to one .
If you close the doors on a woman's wit , it'll fly out the window .
The fool will stay .
This shepherd boy reminds me quite vividly of my daughter .
I'll humor him when he learns how to behave .
Do so , good Messala .
How smooth and cool they seem !
I'm sure I'll feel guilty if I run away from this Jew , my master .
I'm ordering you , go home .
Conquer , crush , conclude , and kill !
No .
No , it would be impossible .
We would profane the other dead souls here if we sang the same requiem for her that we sang for them .
My soul will keep yours company on the way to heaven .
I thank you , Sir John , with all my heart .
Really , young men , though it wasn't a very hard song to get right , the music was still all out of tune .
Don't let her say I kept you .
Listen .
Look , my cousin is whispering to Claudio that she loves him .
You should know , my friends , that I have good hopes for tomorrow , and that I will lead you as if I expect victory rather than an honorable death .
And let me kill Cassio .
Here , noble lord .
Good-bye , my lord .
How many things in life seem good to us because of when they happen !
Come here , good Volumnius .
Well , if you were never at court , you were never exposed to good manners ; if you never witnessed good manners , your manners must be wicked ; wickedness is a sin , and committing sins leads to damnation .
Into my grave .
Have you written that letter to my sister yet ?
I think you're trustworthy one minute and then not the next .
I'm your evil spirit , Brutus .
Hurry up and get to your horse .
All three of them are crazy with despair .
I'd endure it until he came home again .
You know what they say .
Master , knock hard upon the door .
It's dinnertime , my lord .
But try to control your speech .
Sweet Moon , I thank you for your sunny beams .
We're not going to run in our army , Monsieur Monster .
That's true , it's your beauty's fault .
Where , sir ?
Oh , Cassius , if you could only convince Brutus to join us , Don't worry .
Go back with her ?
Gertrude , he says he's found out the reason for your son's insanity .
Dear Celia , I already look much happier than I feel , but you want me to look even happier ?
When a majestic king starts acting silly , then it's my duty to be blunt .
I didn't take any more pains bringing this message than you took pains in thanking me .
Only an hour ago it was nine , and in another hour it will be eleven .
You'd better shut up !
I'll hide and listen in .
But in that "no hope" there are great hopes for you !
Some good friend of his must have died , because nothing else in the world could change a man so much .
He should imprison the person who named you , instead .
Bring him here dead or alive within the next year , or get out off my land .
To tell you the truth , they fought the new enemy with twice as much force as before ; they were like cannons loaded with double ammunition .
And yet I'll still have plenty .
I'll reward you once for your cheerfulness and ten times for your courage .
My name is Hortensio , sir .
I watched him very closely .
I'm not as happy as I seem .
This is just another one of the hallucinations you always get when you're afraid .
What does this mean ?
Bad luck , bad luck ?
Who will advance with me ?
The thane of Cawdor has lost what the noble Macbeth has won .
Tell me , don't you have a virtuous and lovely daughter named Katherina ?
And the one who commands us is our king .
Go tell the priests to perform a sacrifice immediately , and bring me their interpretation of the results .
Please put up with my weakness .
I swear on my soul it was a lie .
What is it , Biondello ?
Now I've done a good day's work .
Who do you think ?
Let's be light-hearted .
Oh , honey !
We'll speak again tomorrow .
King Lear , I've always honored you as king , loved you as my father , obeyed you as my master , and thanked you in my prayers , I'm furious and ready to snap .
No , I'd rather be married to a skull with a bone in its mouth than to either of those men .
And brief , good mother , I'm in a hurry .
When he leaves , it's very important that I talk to you .
Oh , Tranio , what a cruel father he is .
Weren't you ordered , on penalty of , Why Dover ? , Let him answer that question first .
I will do more , though nothing I can do is any good since this remorse comes after the crime , asking for pardon .
It's better to act virtuously rather than vengefully .
I hate it and want all good men's love .
On that point , our letters don't agree .
My dearest love , Duncan is coming here tonight .
If I'm a wasp , look out for my stinger .
You opposed my taking part in the war .
I'm going to let him live .
Think like that , and you'll manage to get honey out of a common weed and find a moral lesson in the devil himself .
Oh , sweet mermaid , don't command me to drown myself in the flood of your sister's tears .
And this is the man who has now become a god , and I'm a wretched creature who must bow down if Caesar so much as carelessly nods my way .
I hope it works out for the best , Lepidus .
Then come to my house tomorrow morning , and since you couldn't be my son-in-law , be my nephew instead .
First , he said you had no right to him .
How does it feel to be Benedick the Married Man ?
Valentine's Day is over .
You had a Clarence , too , and Richard killed him .
I haven't done anything to you .
How's the prince ?
It will be to your advantage , because I'll leave our father's house and all his property to you , while I live and die a shepherd here in the forest .
Come help me bless this couple , so they will be prosperous and have many children .
He was the one who denounced his father .
He is coming .
Is this true ?
It's the former Hero !
One voice speaks well and talks about his friend .
If you don't want to , then good riddance .
Can't what , my lord ?
And hot as ginger .
Dear general , I never gave you any reason to hate me .
When she takes a sip , I bob up against her lips and make her spill the drink all over her withered old neck .
Give us a smile .
She lied to me , and she may lie to you .
Let go of my hand .
I gave him no order .
Oh , make them joyful !
This haunting business is even stranger than murder .
Oh , good Demetrius , will you find him for me ?
Give me my armor .
Honest Iago's arranged that .
Statilius waved the torchlight at us , but he hasn't come back .
But what did you want ?
Which one of you killed the deer ?
It's all I can do to keep myself from hanging my head down in despair and singing it like poor Barbary .
Your stockings should be falling down around your ankles , your hat flying off your head , your sleeves unbuttoned , your shoes untied , and everything about you demonstrating carelessness and misery .
Boy !
It's undeniable .
They eat us up hungrily , and when they're full , they vomit us up .
Who put out the light ?
Just as a town protected by a wall around it is worth more than a low-lying village , a married man's horned forehead is more honorable than a bachelor's bare forehead .
What's that noise ?
When he comes back from hunting , I'm not going to speak to him .
Antipholus , aren't you originally from Corinth ?
Our forces are ready for them .
Let's hope his sense of shame will send him back to Rome quickly .
Good madam , let me speak .
You're mistaken .
I didn't , either .
And what irks me more than all these things put together is that he does it under the pretense of love , as though for me to eat or sleep would bring on fatal illness or sudden death .
I'll tell her .
You lie .
You should know that I think you're a smart man .
Don't tire yourself out , monsieur .
Oh , I'm sure you don't dislike him so much as to wish he were here alone , even though you say this to find out how the rest of us feel .
He stole it from me .
There's another .
No , of course you don't .
That your interest payments are like Jacob's sheep ?
As for the Jew's contract , don't let it be a factor in your plans .
Tyranny is dead !
You heard her say it wasn't me .
Now , if that's true , and it's obviously true , who's in a better position than Cassio ?
Eros !
Please rise , Queen .
Where is Lucentio ?
No , I've had my say .
So take your last breath .
I've heard that the pyramids build by the Ptolemies are splendid .
So be quiet .
Then why did you travel so quietly ?
I am the worst person alive , and I know it the best .
My lord , no one will believe this in Venice , even though I'd swear I saw it with my own eyes .
Will she go to bed now ?
I lead a charmed life , which can't be ended by anyone born from a woman .
The only thing that I've been entrusted with was getting you from the market and bringing you to your house , the Phoenix , for lunch .
Is your name Shylock ?
Tell your men as much .
Your darling ?
With this in mind , speak , my lord .
I'll do most of the drinking for you .
Damn her !
I'm a nobleman , and I know what I'm doing in assigning this job to you .
What did I do wrong ?
Whatever I think , I have to say .
Up here you can't even hear the waves crashing against the rocks .
So , my sweet brother-in-law , go inside .
This villain is much quicker than I am .
Yes , my good lord .
I appreciate your frankness and your brevity .
Why would she write to Edmund ?
You see how the world goes , Volumnius .
Go back and tell your king I do not seek an encounter with him now but would be willing to march on to Calais without interference , for , to be honest , though it's probably unwise to confess this to a powerful enemy who has the advantage , my men are considerably weakened by illness , my numbers reduced , and those few men I have almost no better than so many Frenchmen , though when they were in good form , I tell you , herald , I thought three Frenchmen walked on every pair of English legs .
He took aim at a beautiful young virgin who was sitting on a throne in the western part of the world , and he shot his arrow of love well enough to have pierced a hundred thousand hearts .
And did you leave him like this ?
I can get the better of religion and a few flimsy vows between a misguided barbarian and a depraved Venetian girl .
So take me to see them .
Before your sentence has been completed ?
Hamlet , you're dead .
Stop , for God's sake !
I have a good reason to cry , but my heart will splinter into a hundred thousand pieces before I let myself cry. , Oh , Fool , I'll go mad !
Is it lunchtime ?
The rest of my life will be nothing but bitterness .
Each day new widows howl , new orphans cry , and new sorrows slap heaven in the face , until it sounds like heaven itself feels Scotland's anguish and screams in pain .
It's not lost , but what if it were ?
No , my lord , unless I could have another husband for the work week .
Eros , send his treasure to him .
You must be ready for revenge , too , when you hear me out .
Then , rejecting my request , you kill
Your lieutenant , Cassio .
As I sat on the shore crying over my father's shipwreck , I heard the music creep over the wild waves , calming their fury and soothing my own grief with its sweet melodies .
You may change your mind later .
We would have liked to have heard your good advice , which has always been serious and helpful , at the council today , but we'll wait until tomorrow .
Didn't you hear it ?
I'll make him tell me the whole story again , where , how often , how long ago , and when he plans to sleep with your wife in the future .
I should backtrack and begin with how my master , Don John , arranged for the Prince , Claudio , and himself to witness this friendly encounter from the orchard .
My bones want to rest after helping me up to this hour .
Let's be disciplined and not delay , because tomorrow is a busy day .
I have quarreled four times , and almost got in a fight .
You are about as much of a thinker as worm's meat is a nice steak .
Please don't take my niece the wrong way , sir .
You said the enemy wouldn't come down but keep to the hills and upper regions .
If you steal my money , you're just stealing trash .
Not very well , but I've met him several times .
Madam , how are you liking this play ?
I'll kill myself out of grief !
I won't sleep until I've delivered your letter , my lord .
Did heaven watch the slaughter and not send down any help ?
Some villain has told lies about me .
I leave him in your care , but oh , if only I were still in his favor I could arrange for better care for him .
Hmmph !
In my bedroom window there is a book .
I almost feel you .
It is better to be tricked completely than to only suspect a little .
It's a nice hazy feeling , so give in to it .
How ingenious to make horseshoes out of felt .
When I've plucked this rose , I can't make it grow again ; it will have no choice but to wither and die .
Well , that doesn't worry me .
It would be better to die that way than to die from being mocked , which is as bad as being killed by tickling .
He's giving her a taste of her own medicine .
Out in the world , I'm like a drop of water , trying to find a drop that matches in the whole wide ocean .
You shall advise me in everything having to do with Cleopatra .
Well , let's go on .
I wish my horse moved as fast as your mouth and was as tireless .
You , Nick Bottom , have been cast as Pyramus .
She says something , sir , but I will not repeat it to you .
She can hide there and eavesdrop on our conversation .
I have it ready .
I loved wine and gambling , and had more women than a Turkish sultan keeps in his harem .
With all of them at once : they work together to create such an entirely evil person that no good ever manages to enter the mix .
The news I have to tell your majesty is that Buckingham's army has dispersed from sudden floods and heavy rainfall .
You stay on the left .
Doesn't it look like the king ?
That's always true .
Oh no !
The noblest men who ever walked on leather have walked on my handiwork .
I won't pretend to be the devil's porter anymore .
Let me see .
How are you , my pretty Bianca ?
Won't you tell me who told you that ?
Oh , sir , the problem goes far deeper than you realize .
There's justice in heaven after all !
Revise your statement , or you may damage your inheritance .
I can't make up for everything that I'd like to , so accept such kindness as I can offer .
They're really being spoken , sir , and they're true .
Also , I've kept my sword unsheathed since I saw this , in front of the Capitol I met a lion who looked at me and strutted by without bothering to attack me .
Is this the Prince ?
Wouldn't he be a comfort to us in our travels ?
No , that's not true .
And how did you get in here ?
Welcome , Publius .
Thanks for that .
Good-bye , noble Agrippa .
While we're walking , you can tell me how I ended up sleeping on the ground with these humans last night .
Yes , on land you do outnumber me .
Look , how she blushes like a virgin !
What's this ?
Unless you're talking about his love for this kind of foolishness , which , judging from his appearance , he has , he is no fool for love , as you pretend .
The boy was going to support me in my old age !
We don't know .
My servants might overhear , and old Gremio is still hanging around , so we might be interrupted .
Now , I'll begin : first , we came down a steep hill , my master riding behind my mistress , Both on one horse ?
I thumb my nose at superstitions .
Are you considering desertion , as well ?
Do they attract big audiences ?
Its own color .
I wouldn't either , by daylight .
What's up , Catesby , what does your master say ?
Now let's sit closely around this candle and discuss our needs .
I'll rest here .
Tell him I'll take the leek out of his hat on Saint Davy's Day and slap his head with it .
What do you mean by all this ?
He sees himself in my two eyes , so there's two of him .
No more talk about my father ; you'll be whipped for slander one of these days .
Are you rich ?
Really , my lord , I don't know what to make of it , but she loves him with such a passion that it's past all understanding .
No more of this .
We can't waste time between now and six o'clock .
Let's give them room .
So get prepared .
What evil things were done to us that we were driven here ?
And what of all this ?
I know that he'll be on our side .
Not for Cadwallader and all his goats .
Please don't tell me any more .
No more than that , my lord .
We need to stay away from each other until midnight tomorrow .
Therefore , accept my everlasting farewell .
Young people often lose their self-control even without any help from others .
The demon Hoppedance is in Tom's belly , crying for some fish to eat .
Don't shed even one tear .
Then the Jew must show you mercy .
I'll do that .
Won't King Richard let me speak with him ?
You have weapons ?
Go .
Go ahead .
I'll take you to where he sleeps , and you can pound a nail into his head .
That won't work , since I'm still reaping the rewards of that murder : my crown and my queen .
Are you his brother ?
Calm down , sir , please .
Caesar , I have news about Menecrates and Menas , notorious pirates who prowl the sea in a variety of ships .
Wait until I read the letter .
Ask her to help you heal the rift between her husband and you .
My lord ?
That's my brave lord !
I am arrogant , vengeful , ambitious , with more ill will in me than I can fit into my thoughts , and more than I have time to carry it out in .
Gentlemanly manners have more sway around here than force does .
Your heart's going to break .
Why are you looking for me ?
Yes , I see them coming .
Where's your master , Dromio ?
Cut yourself ?
He cried out , "Wait for me , dear cousin .
Is that why you're talking so wildly ?
Has homely old age taken the alluring beauty from my poor cheeks ?
My noble lord , What is it , Iago ?
It's the blessed sun .
Everything's fine now .
If we're Hello , Monsieur Le Beau .
You , Roderigo !
She's busy and can not come ! " Is that an answer ?
Indeed , they say that the senators plan to establish Caesar as a king tomorrow , and he'll wear his crown at sea and on land everywhere except here in Italy .
Stillness and nighttime are perfect for beautiful music .
When will we get to the top of that cliff ?
He's having a fit and talking nonsense .
Ha !
Let the ship sail close to the wind .
Oh , Luciana , did he tempt you like that ?
You'll have to leave tonight .
He's welcome too .
What's that ?
I could find it in my heart to beat him , Come on , kiss my feet .
This land will belong to your and Albany's children forever. , And now what does my second daughter Regan , the wife of Cornwall , have to say ?
Tell me what you are .
I'll back you up .
Silver .
Madam , I'd rather sew my lips shut than tell a lie when my life depends upon it .
That's true .
Where is that messenger ?
What does my powerful master wish for ?
Actually , I'd like a few pounds of grass .
They've made many raids upon Italy , and the naval patrols go pale at even the thought of resisting them .
So , in the name of God and all the good that will come of this
Now , madam , undress and come to bed .
Menas , I don't understand how minor quarrels can be superseded by greater ones .
Well , there you go .
Where's your conscience now ?
Welcome , good Robin .
Was it you that was always plotting to kill him ?
That's merciful but a bit careless .
If our general had been his old self , we would have won .
Well , well , well .
Tell me how .
Report back to him fast and tell him what has happened .
Then we can let this ambitious tyrant continue unchallenged until each of us is killed at his whim .
No .
He's rushing on his way here right now , and Regan's with him .
Time will tell what you've got up your sleeve .
We'll be married tomorrow .
Sweet Phoebe , do not scorn me .
Is it possible ?
He was like a schoolboy who finds a bird's nest and happily shows it to his friend , who then steals it from him .
No , I don't , except as a friend .
Their bodies may remain here in England , but their hearts are encamped on the fields of France already .
You'll hear more from me by midnight .
Ungodly and monstrous !
Hound or spaniel , bitch or dog , Whether your tail is short or curly , Tom will make you cry and wail .
What infinite peace do king's give up that private men enjoy ?
But before we reached the end point , Caesar cried , "Help me , Cassius , or I will sink ! " And just as Aeneas , the hero who founded Rome , emerged from the fires of Troy with his elderly father Anchises on his shoulder , so I emerged from the Tiber carrying the tired Caesar .
No stony tower , no brass walls , no airless dungeon , no iron chains can contain a strong mind .
Horatio , you're the best man I've ever known .
What's the matter with you , madam ?
Hastings loved the prince's father so much that we won't be able to persuade him to do anything against the prince .
You're like the poor cat in the old story .
I'm very glad to see you .
A mischievous child .
I'll run away from you and hide in the bushes , and leave you to the mercy of wild animals .
And yet I would have made her happy had our luck not been so bad .
Were you ever at court , shepherd ?
With all my heart , I give you that thing which , if you didn't already have it , I'd try with all my heart to keep from you .
I will , my lord .
In that case I'm afraid you're damned by both your father and your mother .
I'll have nothing to do with you .
Oh , if only we had with us here ten thousand of those men back home in England who aren't working today .
Or Tuesday noon or at night , or Wednesday morning .
Wait a minute .
And request that she come here .
What time is it ?
Does anyone know if Donalbain is with his brother ?
And so , good-bye .
Signior Baptista , I'm glad to see you. , Sir , this is the gentleman I told you of .
But we haven't made any preparations .
Be brave like the lion and proud .
And smelled like that , too ?
Separate me from life with your sharp teeth .
You're acting stupid , Casca , and you lack the quick wits that a Roman should have , or else you don't use them .
Let Merriman catch his breath , the poor dog's foaming at the mouth .
Learn from the wise , and comprehend : the courtier's perfume is made from cat discharge , much more disgusting than tar .
Should I tend your pigs and eat husks with them ?
This is the time of night when witches come out , when graveyards yawn open and the stench of hell seeps out .
And at the base of Pompey's statue , with his cloak covering his face , which was dripping with blood the whole time , great Caesar fell .
Oh , I wish you weren't , you poor , frightened soul .
She weeps for Edward and so do I , while she does not weep for Clarence , though I do .
The gates of mercy will be closed by then , and harsh and hard-hearted soldiers , who have tasted blood , will have free reign to commit whatever violence they want , mowing down your lovely young virgins and budding infants .
Yes , hand me one too .
I accept your devotion with my deepest love .
Some to Ligarius's .
Come on , do you think I can't recognize you by your excellent wit ?
But don't be easily won over .
My good lord , You've always been a liar .
Goneril would go crazy if I chose Regan , but it would be hard to get in with Goneril while her husband's still alive .
A good plan , warrior king .
I'll try to make myself worth your knowledge .
There must be some political news from Venice , or some dangerous plot here in Cyprus has ruined his good mood .
Lord Hastings , will you go with me ?
Why are we talking about this ?
His most horrible murder .
And servants of the Danish king .
Oh Ratcliffe , I had a terrifying dream !
Sir and madam , to make grand speeches about what majesty is , what service is , or why day is day , night is night , and time is time is just a waste of a lot of day , night , and time .
Seyton !
We'll take care of it .
Decius , go tell them that Caesar won't come .
Well then , you must be in love .
I will , lady .
But not so nice when women misbehave .
And I'll use that piece of rope to welcome you with .
Please , let's not talk about it .
Goodbye .
I swear , I scorn the word .
I will mourn Hero tonight .
I hope poisonous swampy fog covers her face and ruins her complexion !
But , sir , here comes your servant .
Thanks to your majesty .
Is Caesar visiting the Capitol tomorrow ?
I wish we had a signed legal contract .
Finally , the ceremony done , he called for wine .
Do you know where I'm going ?
Why would you celebrate it ?
It will be as the gods see fit .
Let him come forward .
Oh , darling Orlando , it's so hard to see you wearing your heart in a sling .
Play the music. , Take my hands , my queen , and we'll lull these people to sleep with our soft dancing .
Hey , naked guy , Poor Tom's chilly .
It's always dangerous when little people get caught in the crossfire of mighty opponents .
Yes , my lord .
But what's your trade ?
The next day we had our fight at sea , and you know what happened after that .
As for this slave , Iago , if we can think of any torture that will hurt him a lot but keep him alive a long time , he'll have it .
Thomas Grey , knight , of Northumberland , I arrest you for high treason .
His name !
He will if he lives long enough to become a man .
If I could beg others to change their minds , begging would convince me , too .
No .
I know that voice .
Unless my horse goes faster than expected , I will be back an hour or two after sunset .
She's mine , and I'm giving her to Demetrius .
How could that happen ?
Nobody delivered it , my lord .
I've been stripped of everything , betrayed .
Did you speak to him ?
Your speech is more refined than I would expect in such a remote place as this .
I'll rest now .
The letters he spoke of may help me .
He brushes his hat in the mornings .
No , and she swears she never will .
I also heard that your daughter spent eighty ducats in Genoa one night .
No , you have to swear it .
But she is no virgin .
Anyway , Jessica , go inside .
It was obviously a hit .
Why , what's the danger ?
Be good enough to hear me out .
This is what happened : he and Cleopatra sat on chairs of gold on a silver-covered stage in the marketplace .
If your highness is willing , take revenge on him for that , because I know you're brave enough , I don't dare to , That's for sure .
Hey out there !
Hide with a false pleasant face what you know in your false , evil heart .
Have you mangled my tongue so badly in these seven short years that my only son can no longer recognize my weak , sorrow-ravaged voice ?
We age and die because they wear us out .
May a hot southwest wind blow on you and cover you with blisters all over .
So you finally find me worthy of your attentions .
We're in .
Don't pardon that .
They have a massive army .
Exactly , madam , until I sleep with you .
I have received letters that say the same .
There isn't much time .
I am one , my lord .
My Cordelia , even the gods admire how much you've sacrificed for me .
Most noble sir , stand up .
What you wanted is yours .
And after this I'll be good and hope you forgive me .
Well , I hope you stay in that frame of mind or some poor man will end up with his face all scratched up .
Confess and love" is more like it .
Even though half of him is like a
That's an odd thing to say .
I hate it when I hear a blustery actor in a wig tear a passion to shreds , bursting everyone's eardrums so as to impress the audience on the lower levels of the playhouse , who for the most part can only appreciate loud noises and pantomime shows .
Come , sweet Audrey .
My plans take me a roundabout way .
Tomorrow I'll be at the depths of my misery thinking about the happiness my brother has achieved , in having what he wished for .
What do you call this ?
Oh , be quiet .
I'll drink later .
He mustn't go to prison .
I swear to you by Rosalind's own pretty hand that I am that unfortunate man .
This is a horrible sight .
I can not speak your England .
I'll leave you without revealing any emotion , like a man of steel .
Everything except something to live on .
And , if you need to , approach the subject of me : tell them that when my mother became pregnant with the insatiable Edward , my noble father was fighting in France .
What , not even to pray ?
You'll beat me ?
I am indebted to you for your last sermon .
Father , this isn't easy for me .
That part of his reputation will stand .
for the other men , we can make them believe anything we choose .
It's all still yours .
Some tardy cripple must have taken the counter-order , who came after Clarence was already buried .
She said something she shouldn't have said , I'm sure of that .
You're defending an impostor ?
But why , why , why ?
If there are any , speak , for it is he whom I've offended .
Shall we get to work ?
Help , help , help !
Yes .
The British troops are coming near .
Swear by my sword you'll never mention what you've heard .
Do you really think I'm no stronger than the rest of my sex , with such a father and such a husband ?
I had no idea she was cheating on me .
Not of killing him , because I have a warrant for it , but of being damned for killing him , which no warrant can protect me from .
And yet I still regret the anger that drove me to kill them .
Not us .
That was a poor unlucky beggar .
Yet you killed my children .
Oh , let me remember what happened to Hastings and hurry to
Oh , I'm such a coward for living long enough to see my best friend taken before my eyes !
Please , let me review the contract .
But I know why a snail carries its house on its back .
My lord , my lord , I don't want to hear any more about it .
Tonight I received a letter from my sister telling me all about them , and warning me not be at home in case they come to stay at my house .
Yes , but no doctor can help me .
And they thought Margaret was Hero ?
Who are they following ?
How dare you talk about kindness or shame .
Come and see the proof .
You should know I've earned a thousand gold pieces from Don John .
How is your majesty doing ?
If you choose that one , I'm yours , along with the picture .
Come on , Nerissa , I want to go see this man who's come so courteously .
Yes , that's all true , but what do you mean by it , my lord ?
In that case , I don't much care for you either .
Yes , his chest !
I know that , sir .
So there's a rift between Othello and Cassio ?
Tell me .
I'm glad about that .
What is your name ?
I'll go put my armor on .
Yes , but I am insulting myself by thinking this way .
The people fear me in the country and the town .
With all my heart , Phoebe .
I can't wait to meet her !
Imagine them locking me out on a night like this !
I'm telling you , Aliena , I can't stand being apart from Orlando .
Knock , knock , knock !
Tonight we'll wander through the streets and observe the people .
No , we'll sneak away at supper time , disguise ourselves with masks at my house , and come back in an hour .
What do you have to tell me ?
I remember wooing a pea plant in her name , and then taking two pea pods and begging her to wear them "for my sake." Those of us who are really in love will do the strangest things .
Free from the bondage you are in , Messala .
Give me my fishing rod .
I beg you , daughter , don't make me crazy .
I met this man with my glove in his cap , and I have been as good as my word .
How will you get proof ?
Who's shouting ?
Your logic is so foolish .
Shut up , fool .
Mistress , you know about that .
Where's Antony ?
From their saddles into the dirt , but that's another story .
You , constable , are representing the Prince himself .
Leave now .
Go on .
No , no , until it comes true we'll pretend it was just a dream we had .
Caesar has sent , Too slow a messenger .
Get out of here , you measly , lying wretch .
I'm determined to be heard by someone .
Yes , that was it .
What three things does drink make a man do ?
Oh , Mother Nature , why did you create lions ?
Goodbye , good Mr. Love .
It sounds more like you're insulting me .
Get down and swear it .
When was there ever an age , since the beginning of time , that didn't feature more than one famous man ?
We are your servants , your highness , and as always our house and everything in it is at your disposal , for after all , we keep it in your trust and we're glad to give you back what's yours .
Are you trying to sleep with him ?
Well , lead on .
You are an honest man .
The muffled queen" ?
I swear I won't , sir .
But you , my noble lords , may name a time , and I'll second it on the duke's behalf , which I don't think he'll mind .
Stay and tell me more .
Take care of the lady .
What's up , daughter and niece ?
We know each other's faces , but as for our thoughts , he doesn't know any more about my thinking than I do about yours or his , or you do about mine .
That's right , or drinking , swearing , fist-fighting , visiting prostitutes , that kind of thing .
The devil in him is strong !
You're torturing me , Tubal .
Beware of the devil .
But I will tell you this very plainly : I have challenged Claudio , and either he'll accept the challenge or admit he's a coward .
But you'll have to catch me !
It was just that the showiness of his grief sent me into a fury .
Pull them apart .
Forget your epilogue .
His kiss is as holy as bread blessed by a priest .
The Duke and any of my fellow senators will take this wrong as seriously as if it were their own .
I'd rather be a toad in a moldy basement than to have only a part of someone I love , sharing the rest of her with others .
My lord , he's afraid you mean him harm .
It's a disgrace to us all .
What was it ?
Welcome to Rome .
What are they doing in the north when they should be in the west serving their king ?
If I had as many sons as I have hairs on my head , I couldn't hope that any of them would die more honorably than he did .
Leave me , my friend .
What is it ?
She was lying even as she was going down to hell .
Hey , what's this , Adam ?
Who's coming ?
Your old age and the prospect of death are making you imagine things .
Here on her breast there's a little bloody mark .
It's like a cannon .
Was a man ever as dirty as me ?
Yes Signior ?
If Fulvia were the last woman on earth , there would be a reason to grieve .
Foolish girl , in the eyes of most people this man's a Caliban , and compared to him , they're angels .
We'll put a picture of you on a sign , right above the words "Come see the tyrant ! " I'm not going to surrender and have to kiss the ground in front of Malcolm , or be taunted by the common people .
The Moor's mind has already become infected with my poisonous suggestions .
Men who risk everything hope to make profits .
Dolabella .
Instead , hide your true face behind smiles and friendliness .
To which we all appeal .
Do you recognize the handwriting ?
She shall , Lucentio .
Let's have the evidence .
I'll give you cramps for saying that , horrible pains in your sides that will keep you from breathing .
That I won't stand for .
What do you want with her , sir ?
No , no , they wouldn't .
But a lot of men have more hair than intelligence .
Yes .
Brutus killed me .
Good morning to both of you .
That's how you'll talk about me when you're in this mood .
But my heart is still throbbing to know one thing .
I've proved my trustworthiness by giving myself a voluntary wound here in my thigh .
But I bet Fortinbras will win the election to the Danish crown .
By this leek , I swear I'll make you pay for this .
No ?
No .
You've got a sword , Gloucester .
What , you ignore my kind advice and try to please the devil I'm warning you about ?
Were you thinking of spending the night here ?
One , so they can save the money they spent on hairstyling , and two , so that when their hair falls out it doesn't land in their dinner .
Or any of you ?
I didn't hear it .
Leave us .
Bring him with us .
Just obey me a little bit longer .
When asked the Duke and Duchess of Cornwall if I could take pity on the king and shelter him from the storm , they took my house away from me and ordered me never to talk about him , lobby for him , or support him in any way .
I hope those lions stay far away from him .
The bearer of bad news is often blamed for it .
I feel this pinprick .
Do you love me ?
You see me here , gods , a grieving old man , as wretched in his grief as he is in his old age .
Turn right at the next turn , but at the following turn , turn left .
All I ever did was tell him how hurtful and bad it was .
Poor imitation queen , why do you align yourself with this humpbacked spider when he's got you trapped in his deadly web ?
Oh !
An awful monster !
I've decided on a plan that doesn't require your assistance .
To none but you , only to you .
Your Majesty shall mock at me .
I'll watch this play .
You know I would never approve a war against my own cause .
I can't hide what I am .
Should be ?
Unfaithful ?
Was my father a traitor , Mother ?
In an instant we were separated from them , as if in a dream , and brought here in a daze .
What , you look amused .
He won't get the better of me .
I wish you could just stammer this hidden man out of your mouth like wine out of a narrow-necked bottle : either too much at once or none at all .
You're as pale as your nightgown !
Well then , add some interjections that indicate laughter , like Hold on , Friar .
You and your servant are very funny , sir .
Ah , but there is , Horatio , there's a lot of offense .
You're up early .
Oh , my son , my son !
Well , you know he sometimes walks here in the lobby for four hours at a time .
What's your profession ?
Love ?
Shall we go see this fortification , men ?
Every night I'm awakened by his Poor dear , goodbye .
Well , eventually God will send him some more hair , if he thanks Him .
I'm just saying that if you're good and beautiful , your goodness should have nothing to do with your beauty .
Here is some money for you to kill me immediately .
Would you like some more sauce to go with it ?
And that's how she died ?
How are you doing ?
I'm sure you both remember me .
I think I can do that .
Let's get out of here !
The old guy .
No , you should tell him to hold his hands !
Why , you speak like an experienced and quiet watchman .
Then no man has ever been honest .
She's only sad when she sleeps , and not even then .
You ought to be ashamed of yourself !
No , it doesn't mean anything .
That's one of them .
Oh , that's pathetic !
I'll look for him and secretly help him .
She's the daughter of this famous Duke of Milan I heard so much about but never saw before .
One more thing , sir .
But don't expect any more than that .
That's for to me to decide .
Finally , after shaking my arm a little , and jerking his head up and down three times , he sighed like it was his last breath .
What's the matter ?
I never caused her any harm , as far as I know .
I think a story like that would win my own daughter over .
If you behave yourself and join us in our circle dance and moonlight celebrations , then you can come with us .
Listen to me , good brother .
Is that possible ?
Answer all of us , now .
What could my sister's letter to him say ?
There was even more foolishness , if I could only remember it .
Did you have to give them everything ?
But don't keep wondering without more proof .
She gave it to him , and he gave it to his whore .
And I'll sing it for the duke in the intermission of a play .
Look , you've got his wrinkled hands .
I know him to be valiant .
Oh , this is terrible !
Oh , if only I were a man !
Lord Hamlet. , Please let him be all right !
This is the devil Flibbertigibbet .
Our jailers will shrivel up with old age before they make us cry again .
This is the Dauphin's message .
I'll expect you .
Six or seven thousand , at most .
Are you hurt , lieutenant ?
Kinsmen , I hope the time is coming when people will be safe in their own bedrooms .
Look at all the devoted servants who work for their masters their whole lives for nothing but their food , and then when they get old they're terminated .
And you'll speak on the same platform as I do , after I'm done .
Tyrants themselves wept when they heard about it .
Even innocents can not always escape disaster .
No , definitely not !
But Benedick was once an enemy of love as well , and now he's become a real man .
Why , what's the matter ?
There are women like that out there , no question .
You think it's a big deal that this fierce storm is soaking me to the skin .
You will be an accessory to both crimes .
Please , sir , be kind to me and tell me .
I could not forget you , since I never saw you before in my life .
And didn't I finally arrive to comfort you ?
How are you , my friend ?
If you come to me after tomorrow and say , "That's my glove , " I swear by this hand , I will take it and give you a box on the ear .
Well , then , that's how it is .
Lock yourself in and send him word that you're dead .
You can heat your iron up in here .
Good lady , don't be angry with the child .
That's good advice .
That with a series of legal writs , Octavius , Antony , and Lepidus have put a hundred senators to death .
This is a sleepy tune .
But I agree , sir , that we were locked out .
Now please go .
No , let's not swear an oath .
Live a little , be comforted a little , cheer up a little .
The East is very seductive .
It's as strange as this other thing which I don't understand .
And if it doesn't go well , then you can keep her hidden in a nunnery , the best place for someone with her kind of dirtied reputation , away from the public's eyes , tongues , mind , and insults .
Will you fight well ?
No , not at all , All right , all right .
Shall I include hell as well ?
My happiness and yours lie in her .
Yes , I found him when he was asleep , so that's taken care of too , and the Athenian woman was sleeping near him .
Every town and port is crawling with henchmen on the lookout , waiting to capture me .
There is a crab-apple here .
It was a lovely wedding , and we're doing really well on our trip home .
Will it be tonight at supper ?
Good morning to you .
I'd never heard such raucous music , such pleasant thunder .
Here comes the king , the queen , and the noblemen of court .
Don't listen to the bell , Duncan , because it summons you either to heaven or to hell .
Oh , to think you've been rejected !
For the enemy , see , and you can explain this to the duke , see , has dug its own tunnels four yards below ours .
Where are Lysander and beautiful Hermia ?
It's been this way ever since the first government was organized .
He didn't know how to stop it .
Come forward and speak .
She was a hellcat in school .
Is this the family tomb of Leonato ?
I'm still a virgin .
But you're not down and out , either , are you ?
Why ?
Not in the stocks , fool .
Good morning , sir .
If you wish to speak of love , speak more softly .
I did it myself .
Don't damn yourself .
Help , Charmian , help , Iras , help !
Hear the shrill whistle that brings order to the hubbub .
I've changed my mind about that .
These men all have one intention , and it's directed against Caesar .
I'll pull on these smaller legs .
Now would you please listen once again to the request I made to you earlier ?
Oh , sun , I will never see another one of your sunrises .
Oh , just lies , sir .
I want to be friends with you , and forget all the times you've embarrassed and humiliated me .
Agrippa , go start the battle .
I can't blame you , old lord .
Oh , they say that dress surpasses all others .
Come on , my lord .
Here comes Catesby again .
Today , great duke , she locked me out of my house and feasted there with whores .
It was the day he overcame the Nervii warriors .
Yes , right away .
You should pity me for that reason , not hate me .
Speaking for myself , and no offense to the general or anyone else , I hope I'm going to heaven .
And I'll tell him about the letter too .
Let's seek out some shady place where we can sit down alone and cry our hearts out .
I didn't order it .
He's a traitor .
We'll probably witness many more outbursts from him , like banishing Kent .
My mistress and her sister are waiting for you .
It's time for me to go .
Greed has been the downfall of many kings .
But it wasn't until this afternoon that he broke out into violence .
You do the same .
I'm dying to see the prince .
If you had been afraid to break an oath with him , the crown you are currently wearing would have graced the head of my child , and both princes would still be alive , not preyed on by worms .
I have no doubt he got ashore alive .
I'm sorry you're leaving my father like this .
Hey , Grumio !
Those tears will bring blessings to you .
Let him sink there so the sea will cover him !
Absolutely , people should be what they appear to be .
By this sword , I will .
As soon as the deed is done , you will be in my favor and I will promote you .
Edmund , you deserve me to be your woman .
Look , here comes a walking fire .
You didn't do anything else to earn this punishment ?
I can't tell you anything else .
She says she thinks this is a prank .
Look , he can become invisible .
But I would rather abstain from everything for four days than drink so much in one .
Brutus , may I have a word with you ?
It's true !
You may have lost his respect , but so have I .
For you to threaten to kill me is most unlawful .
Oh , here she comes .
But how ?
Welcome to Elsinore .
We want to hear the will .
As a friend or an enemy ?
Why would they do that , my lord ?
And I see a lot of Orlando here .
Just a moment .
Whom should I knock ?
Crazy" I'm calling it , since how can you say what craziness is except to say that it's craziness ?
We killed those men and sent them to rest in peace so that we could gain our own peace .
Gentlemen , stand up .
Don't follow me .
Oh , shut up .
Do I blame Nature for being so thrifty ?
Either be calm and polite or I'll drown you out with the music of war .
So be calm .
We'll do it .
You are Antonio , you are he .
Really , cousin , it's him .
One of the sisters poisoned the other out of love for me , and then killed herself .
Two hundred ducats .
My ear must pull it out .
Tom will chase them off. , Go away , you mongrels !
After midnight , for two nights running , these two guards , Marcellus and Barnardo , saw a figure that looked very much like your father , in full armor from head to toe .
Brother John Bates , isn't that dawn breaking over there ?
Don't talk to me .
What a horrible world we live in !
I'll give the first one , Pompey .
If she and I are happy , what's it to you ?
Hurry .
He really plays well .
And what a beard trimmed like the general's or a rough uniform will do among foaming mugs and brains washed with ale , you wouldn't believe .
Be good enough to take back the same answer I gave before .
Who is so low that he wouldn't ?
Well , praise the Lord you're ugly .
Tell me .
Damn my soul if these accusations are true !
Just as you got Milan , I'll get Naples .
What if she's pretty but stupid ?
And I'm her father as well .
Please pardon our brother Clarence .
That's right , and then after we fixed the moon , we'd go bird-hunting .
On , on , you noblest Englishmen , descended as you are from battle-tested fathers , fathers who , like so many Alexander the Greats , have fought in these regions from morning until night , sheathing their swords only when there was no one left to fight .
Really ?
I don't know that , once he knows what I know .
When I could see , I didn't always see clearly .
When did you become so fond of singing , boy ?
Now summon up the image of stealthy murmurs and engulfing darkness filling the wide vessel of the universe .
I'm no ordinary fairy .
The moon has set .
Let me try : If there's a buck who needs a doe Tell him Rosalind will do .
A messenger from Lord Stanley .
Her heart is carrying a heavy weight .
I do suffer love , because I love you against my will .
Oh , and then at the very next turn , don't turn left or right , but turn down and around to the Jew's house .
Ever since Cordelia left for France , sir , the fool has been depressed .
My dear clever Ariel , listen carefully .
This will either make us or break us .
Yes , they have .
He is made of treachery , and has run away to avoid his crimes .
Who's that ?
I've stayed up with you for two nights now , and I haven't seen any evidence of what you were talking about .
My good lord , I still need you to like me .
So think carefully about what you want , beautiful Hermia .
Why should we do this ?
Master , master !
Leave .
So I Your Honor's actors , hearing of your recovery , have come to perform a pleasing comedy for you , and your doctors approve wholeheartedly .
Answer me in a word .
Let's see .
I pardon that man .
Are you riding far ?
What did he say ?
Please hear what Goneril is saying .
Then it looks like Macbeth will become king .
Bring me to my host , Macbeth .
You have no reason to say that .
Do you have it with you ?
Let thunder flatten the spherical world , crack open all the molds from which nature forms human beings , and spill all the seeds from which ungrateful humans grow !
Don't you suspect my office ?
He must do this , or I'll recant the pardon I just delivered .
It won't be long before I'm back .
Go get Aliena ready , because , look , here comes my Rosalind .
Come with me , Silvius .
You know , you're right .
This just may cheer me up .
Look , here she comes .
Where is he ?
I haven't even heard a mouse squeak .
To bed , to bed !
If I were my father , cousin , would I do this ?
But I beg you , don't interpret my suspicions as slander against you .
Oh , no , that was my lady's voice .
What's going on , my lord ?
The Egyptian flagship , the Gods and goddesses , the whole congregation of them !
Dat it not be de custom pour les ladies of France , I can not tell vat is To kiss .
Let me help you up .
Yes , even if I die an hour later .
Which of you does not tremble when you see me ?
Their hounds are unequaled in courage .
You absolute villain !
I'm a poor man who's been humbled by many misfortunes .
All those memories pain his mind so deeply that guilt and shame keep him away from Cordelia .
But so what ?
Where are you all off to ?
Poor poisonous fool , be angry and bite .
I can't , ma'am .
Tomorrow , while it's still early , I will go see the witches .
A better example , come on .
If you're the ones setting my daughters against me , don't let me be foolish enough to take it lying down .
Tubal , a wealthy Jew I know , will supply me with the cash .
Mercy , mercy !
There isn't a single protrusion in the castle walls where these birds haven't built their hanging nests to sleep and breed .
Thank you , sir .
Here's the hut , my lord .
He's had a ship wrecked coming from Tripolis .
Here comes the Prince and Claudio .
Armed forces have already landed .
I did , sir , but it didn't answer me .
Listen to this .
Show me , show me .
Don't ask me what I know .
Can any horse retrace his footsteps with the same energy he had when he walked them the first time ?
He was an admirable king .
But we already swore , sir .
I think we'll have to leave out all the killing , come to think of it .
One more thing , good gentlemen .
Signior Angelo , please excuse us .
If he can manage to walk after our fight , I'll never wrestle for money again .
I don't want to hear you sing .
Listen to me , madam .
Nobody will hurt us .
So when should he come ?
Iago .
I never saw it or suspected it , so it never hurt me .
Do you really think so ?
Oh , you mighty gods !
No , who are Long live the king !
I'm glad that my weak words have provoked even this small show of protest from you .
Just like the rabbit , who lives where she is born .
Well , not in deed , madam , since I can't do anything unchaste .
Have you told him all her faults , Hortensio ?
I beg your
Can you bring me to him ?
Fury , Fury ! , Get over there , Tyrant , there .
Well , he's alive .
Great God of heaven , say amen to all this !
He's asking him to tell the story again .
Can you tell me ?
Surrender , dog !
Iago has kept his word .
Do I look as pale as everyone else does , Lord Dorset ?
Why are you talking to me like this ?
Kill him rather than let him leave this room .
With all my heart .
Come talk to me about this .
I'll put it on anyway .
You armor my heart .
I'll give you a good reason to cringe , I promise you .
No , madam , no .
Now start the music , and sing the solemn hymn .
Is your name Goneril ?
Yes , do you hear me , Balthasar ?
It's now late at night , and actions must accommodate bodily needs , which we'll satisfy with only a short rest .
Has she told Benedick how she feels ?
Beware of March 15th .
You're a traveler .
Therefore the dukes of Berri , Bretagne , Brabant , and Orleans shall advance , and you , Prince Dauphin , will swiftly entrench and fortify our fortress towns with men of courage and the means to defend themselves .
Your children will be kings .
Don't move , dog .
Only one man in ten thousand is good in this world .
So why aren't our eyelids heavy ?
I think you're an ass .
Was it you that he rescued ?
My food , my fortune , my sweetest hope , my heaven on earth , and my entrance to heaven .
But tell me .
Now , let it work .
So Rosencrantz and Guildenstern are in for it .
Yes , my lord .
Cure her of that .
Is the news good or bad that you enter without knocking ?
Absolutely .
And because I know how fond she is of music , playing her instruments , and poetry , I plan to hire live-in tutors for her .
Yes , my lord .
And our drunkenness does detract from our achievements , as great as they are , and lessens our reputations .
What's going on ?
Pretty York , who told you about his teeth ?
We have lost a major portion of the world through utter foolishness .
The Duke of Cornwall , my master and patron , is arriving tonight .
Lord , how you've changed !
I met my father in the woods yesterday and had a long conversation with him .
Whatever has already been done can't be undone now .
Listen , I hear them .
I'm going to laugh myself to death over this silly monster .
The answer , my dear , is that they didn't dare , because the people of Milan loved me too much .
I'm glad to hear it .
Are you coming again for ransom ?
Oh , what a wonderful new world , that has such people in it !
I love you as a child should love her father , neither more nor less .
And you've done well on land .
I go over hills and valleys , through bushes and thorns , over parks and fenced-in spaces , through water and fire .
Okay , who does it trot for ?
But our courage should only be the greater for that .
Goodbye , gentlemen .
If he backs down , he'll become as notorious a villain and as saucy a Jack as ever walked on God's earth , in my opinion .
I told him what I thought .
Aren't the others waiting for me , Cinna ?
Hortensio , good friends like us can get by on a few words .
Gentlemen , let's go make sure Cassio's wounds are properly dressed. , Come on , ma'am , you can tell us another story .
You should know that to me , profit isn't more important than honor , but the other way around .
The mercy that was alive in me a moment ago was smothered and killed by your own advice .
The clock hasn't struck yet .
Stand back .
About the table , sir , dinner will be served on it .
But if you fail , you have to leave immediately .
If I find an opportunity , I will give him a piece of my mind .
Tyrant , show your face !
Well , then , we're awake .
What kind of work is this , Charmian ?
I wanted to teach her how perfectly I love her , kinsman , and that's good English .
This is a nasty night to go swimming .
Oh God , I wish the two of them were alive and living in Naples , as king and queen !
In God's name , I beg you not to wish for one more man .
Oh , my mistress , a villain has made a mockery of your love !
Oh , my bad luck has forced honest men to become traitors .
Oh Lord , my spirits are tired !
I sneeze on your manhood .
Call him over here , good Monsieur Le Beau .
Sadness is only appropriate for funerals .
I think you came to see my mother's wedding instead .
I won't take it .
What does he look like , Biondello ?
So , to answer your question .
And my king goes on : if your royal father does not sweeten the bitter insult you sent my king and grant all our demands , Henry's artillery will give you so resounding an answer that the very caves and vaulted cathedrals of France shall echo your mocking of him back in your face .
How does she claim to own you ?
I didn't expect any better from him once he got involved with Mistress Shore .
How can I help you ?
What a silly monster , to think a poor drunk is wonderful .
It's Cinna .
I do hate
When he stands where I am and sees you there .
I should sit in the corner and sing that song , "Heigh-Ho for a Husband ! " Lady Beatrice , I'll get you a husband .
Bring the villain forward .
You shouldn't have to see the punishment we inflict on your father .
I'll go back to the duke of Gloucester and tell him so .
This messenger is wise .
It's better that you didn't kill him .
What's up , mister ?
Get away from me , Satan !
Go , lad , and take them to the pantry .
No , he comes to be married Lady , do you come here to be married to this count ?
So if we know that a man is a thief , should we try to arrest him ?
Is he still alive , good uncle ?
We'll come with you , your Grace .
Whenever they meet , there's a little battle .
I like it better than laughing .
You'll make me angry .
Your eyes look threatening .
Lock the doors .
You there , rogue , what do you have to say about that ?
We have feelings .
No .
In this wicked world , criminals often take the money they stole and use it to buy off the law , shoving justice aside .
Knock , knock !
I don't feel so well , but I won't stop .
If he isn't what he might be , then I wish to God he were !
He had his helmet visor up .
Good morning , General .
I'm sorry I was so wrong about him .
I am a villain .
It might as well be the same with Caesar .
Keep me in your thoughts and go comfort your cousin .
Do as I say .
Sit down for a while , and we'll tell you again the story you don't want to believe , about what we've seen two nights now .
Don't go out today .
What does this mean ?
Excellent , good .
Come talk to me tomorrow as early as you can. , Come with me , my dear love .
You've come right on time .
Oh yes , to smell This is Signor Antonio .
If you care about your health , you won't push me any further .
I'll have none of your money .
It's a good thing he's here to recommend himself .
Speak , Pyramus. , Thisbe , come forward .
My strange self-delusions just come from inexperience .
If you make the accusation convincingly , then my cunning won't fail me .
God have mercy , Grumio !
Wouldn't that have been just as appropriate ?
But you won't take his flesh if he can't pay .
If I can tell him that you have submitted to him sweetly , he'll request your assistance in finding ways in which he can support you .
You can stand in his place .
Let's give a fair verdict .
So prepare to die .
Damn you for mocking me .
Sleep well there on the ground .
What soldiers , fool ?
But if you were married , you'd wield some influence .
Are we all here ?
Yes , boy .
Will you come with me ?
All this fighting is because of you .
You'd better not make that suggestion , Agrippa .
What support did we have besides our father ?
Oh , your report is too poetic , but it sounds so true !
Sir , he may still be alive .
Why are you making these faces ?
My eyes itch , is that an omen I'll be crying soon ?
Time travels at different speeds for different people .
He'd really be your proxy if he married you .
I'm leaving your court now .
So , I won't .
If she feels like coming over here , I'll give her your message .
But mortals like you aren't allowed to hear this description of the afterlife .
Oh , mischief has ruined our plans !
We chase everything in life more excitedly than we actually enjoy it when we get it .
Tell him , if he comes here , I'll explain everything to him and , on my word , he'll leave unharmed .
Wicked woman , these white hairs you're pulling off my chin will come to life and accuse you of wrong-doing .
So , what's the news on the Rialto ?
Morning's here .
And harm is getting close !
I'm going to find out what you're thinking .
So much for our plan .
He and I will be there .
How excellent for Antony !
Oh , the poor bird .
Yes , but these English are seriously short of beef .
So that means she'll come .
Strange things are about to happen , Edmund .
This much I can say about him : he is well-born , has proven his bravery in battle , and has established his good character .
Yes , if it doesn't stand still .
Did you fall ?
Here's some money for you .
Here I go .
And has anyone ever won her , as I've done ?
Damn my suspicious thoughts !
I gave you everything , And it was about time too .
I don't like what you're asking me to do .
Say , what's the trouble ?
When we're in love , we don't see with our eyes but with our minds .
That's exactly what they said .
We'll maintain that she died the instant she was accused , and everyone who hears this will grieve for her , pity her , and excuse her actions .
Didn't you call him a liar ?
So what's going on ?
You may as well try to turn the sun to ice by fanning its face with a peacock feather .
You won it .
But wait a minute .
Is Signior Lucentio at home , sir ?
I'm just sorry I had to be the one to kill him .
But I promise it can be cured with some guidance .
There's hardly a bush for miles around .
My good King , surprise the English and let them know what kind of kingdom you rule over .
Where is he ?
No , I'll be patient .
Go with my brothers to my English peers .
Why bother with them ?
Yes , my lady .
Oh , don't fight by sea , noble Emperor !
I wouldn't allow any commerce .
What's that supposed to mean ?
I'm not sorry , either .
I don't think there's anywhere I'd rather die than in the king's company , as his cause is just and honorable .
I swear I have no idea why he stopped loving me .
With Cassio ?
Now , as you're a Roman , tell me the truth .
Good husband , come home soon .
A tiny spot of evil casts doubt on their good qualities and ruins their reputations .
You have wonderful armor , but give my horse his due .
What's it to you ?
You evil thief , where have you hidden my daughter ?
When the actors were talking about poison ?
Here is his Majesty .
As far as I know , sir .
I'll vouch for Grumio .
A grandmother is loved hardly less than a mother is .
When you have to steal your own wives some day , I'll wait for you just as long .
Here comes Lorenzo .
Yes , what about him ?
You're competing for
Would you like to taste the banquet ?
Which of you has been complaining to the king that I don't like them ?
It will likely be a bloody fight .
No , if you're ever late like this again , I'll refuse to see you .
If I may say so , your Majesty , as I see it he would be a coward and a villain not to .
Instead , lend it to me as your enemy .
You're right .
A jealous woman's poisonous ranting is worse than the bite of a rabid dog .
Hold your tongue .
Do you want to hear what she says ?
That's the beginning of the day we see , but I don't think we'll see the end of it. , Who goes there ?
I believe it completely .
Bassanio , we'll say goodbye for now , since you've found Antonio .
Isn't that him on the ground ?
Did my father hit one of my attendants for scolding his fool ?
Where are your tenants and your followers ?
I've been up all night .
If he seems game to our plan , encourage him to join us and explain all our reasons .
As my child , I order you to do so .
You should have reprimanded him for that .
What's this song ?
What did I promise , my dear ?
Now they've turned around and are clearly heading for Cyprus .
Is it all come to this ?
I might as well go before the King of France , who took my youngest daughter without a dowry , kneel before his throne , and beg him to give me a tiny pension to stay alive .
Huntsman , look after my hounds .
Absolutely not .
I sent him there , sir , but his crimes deserved a worse punishment .
Go to the tomb of your great-grandfather , from whom your own title to the crown derives .
Why are you telling me this ?
And it's too bad that the Moor chose a man with such a deep-rooted drinking problem as his second-in-command .
My lord !
I won't betray them .
I took the hint and spoke to her .
Fresh beauty attracts thugs and thieves even more than money .
I have a wife I love .
are you going to let them break me out of jail ?
And I'd be surprised if he even did that , for he prefers sports , fun , and friends .
I'm going to make sure I stay on your good side , lady .
You'll take the mustard or you'll get no beef from Grumio .
And then she brought me up , and I thank her for that , too .
No , son .
My gallant girls !
Just as bad , my lord .
Help me , help me !
My heart adores him , even though my tongue curses him .
Well hello , my good boy .
I am sorry for her , as I should be , since I am both her uncle and her guardian .
We'll cool the mixture with baboon blood .
What , you don't want me to be chaste ?
And now who but you knows whether I'm yours ?
Call him in .
Fine ! " he says .
How many months do you want ?
I don't see any Thisbe .
Yes , Desdemona .
To cut my penalty from that bankrupt man over there .
God be with all of you , princes .
The three of you have killed a sweet , innocent woman .
I haven't seen him recently .
Why do you look like a frightened goose ?
Madam , please be patient .
I'll fix you , I swear .
No , a woman's gentle brain could never have come up with such crude expressions and even harsher meanings .
I got this purse full of money from you , and my Dromio brought it to me .
He said , "Remember me." I swore I would .
Look how lush and healthy the grass is !
I hope what she's saying is well , sir !
Please Margaret , help me write this poem for Beatrice .
Is it four o'clock ?
It's him !
Then it's certain they're heading for Cyprus .
I recognize something about that voice .
Caesar resents me , but he loves Brutus .
Goodbye .
Yes , I have great cause to be thankful .
Good day to you , sir .
What are the chances of his getting better , lords ?
I'm dying to hear your life story , which must be a strange tale .
You'd give the moon a shove if it got stuck five weeks in its orbit .
I've only been hurt , not killed .
With this ring I give them all to you .
Come on , Nerissa , I have many things to do that you don't even know about yet .
The French ambassador arrived at that moment and asked to see the king .
Menas , I'm not going back on shore .
It's Hortensio , isn't it ?
Are Decius Brutus and Trebonius there ?
Please forgive and forget .
Good luck .
I can't believe that .
Sir , my king , don't waste your time mulling over how strange this business is .
If you took a good look at yourself , or if you thought about this more carefully , your fear would teach you to act more cautiously .
Among them are one hundred twenty-six princes and standard-bearing nobles .
I'm locked in one of them .
So much for Fortinbras .
Oh , damn , damn , damn !
Is this really happening ?
I am his brother , and I love him very much .
Miranda. , Oh father , I've disobeyed you by telling him that !
Come on , what would you say about me ?
If you're as poor a subject as he is a king , you definitely are poor .
That's not your fault !
How low we can fall , Horatio .
Yes , my lord .
As I was standing watch on the hill , I looked toward Birnam , and I thought I saw the forest begin to move .
Get out of my sight ! , I guess if she doesn't love her father , then I'll only have peace when I'm dead. , Call the King of France .
Neither rhyme nor reason can express how much I love her .
It's a play about ten words long , which is the shortest play I've ever heard of .
Well said !
But I'll go out of spite , to feed off the wasteful Christian. , Jessica , my girl , watch the house .
Pretend to be very concerned about both the Prince , who has compromised his honor by making the match , and Claudio , whose reputation will be ruined by this woman who's pretending to be a virgin .
And he's still warm , by God .
Enough of this .
They have their exits and their entrances , and in his lifetime a man will play many parts , his life separated into seven acts .
They'll be here tomorrow or the next day .
Do whatever you want with it .
No , really , I don't .
You have the power to fix it .
I could take back my crown by force , What outrageous ingratitude !
I don't deny it .
Dreams are a sign of ambition , since ambition is nothing more than the shadow of a dream .
Give my answer to them both .
Really , Audrey , I wish you were more poetical .
When you begged to stay , that was the time for words .
Like a mouse caught in my own trap , Osric .
But even so , I'll make doubly sure .
You don't know what money can buy .
But shhh !
Oh , Lord , if they were married , they'd drive themselves crazy within a week .
A two-hundred-year-old witch sewed it while she was in a fevered trance .
What kind of god is ceremony , which suffers more than its worshippers do ?
Well , aren't you a good man ?
And is it healthy to walk uncovered and breathe in the dampness of the morning ?
Of what
Villain , you don't know the laws of God or of man .
Oh , come on now , Kate .
Indeed , the enemy nearly took the bridge , but he was forced to retreat , and the duke of Exeter holds the bridge .
No , please good Meg , I'll wear this one .
If it pleases you , your highness , why don't you sit with us and grace us with your royal company ?
Exactly how long is that , do you think ?
Calm down .
But wait a moment .
Did he confess ?
This hard work would be boring and nasty to me , but I'm working for a mistress who makes me enjoy my labor .
What could I say , my dear ?
What disease is he talking about ?
Don't forget the vows we made to each other .
The enemy gets larger each day .
Or if you follow me , you'd better understand that I'll do something bad to you in the forest .
You've probably heard about the "change" that's come over Hamlet , that's the only word for it , since inside and out he's different from what he was before .
Good night , my lord .
The table is full on both sides .
I have important business that requires me to remain in disguise a while longer .
Are you dreaming or awake ?
Then by all means never let her walk in public .
That's good , Lion !
For a necklace your husband had him make .
The king , the king's to blame .
Why don't you go away for a bit ?
So the lion disappeared .
Is it on record that he built it , or is it just word of mouth ?
If you're joining together to right these wrongs , I'll go as far as any one of you .
Well , I'll hurry and put these papers where you told me .
We'll have a couch made up that's softer and more fragrant even than the bed of lustful
If she can't find out what his secret is , then send him off to England or wherever you think best .
And like I am for Ganymede .
I'd give it all up , yes , I'd sacrifice them all to this devil here , to save you .
Said what , sir ?
Make sure everyone knows that .
I hope with all my heart she will !
But still , my uncle-father and aunt-mother have got the wrong idea .
And she can cry , sir , oh , how she can cry !
We three are married , but you two are defeated .
Good-bye , my lord .
Two or three men , my lord , who brought the message that Macduff has fled to England .
Antonio and Shylock , both of you come forward .
Your Highnesses can both attest to the fact that I've strived mightily , with all my wits and energy , to bring about this royal meeting between you two imperial Majesties .
But as far as I can tell , people with too much suffer as much as people with nothing .
I'm just worried that you've been cozying up to her , and gotten intimate with her .
You've seen these illusions .
If not , it's true , this parting was well done .
This news will comfort Cassius .
But these days , people give each other their hands without their hearts .
The Prince's fool" !
Where's the gold I gave you ?
You who are beautiful beyond words , calm down and let me explain myself .
It's another Hero !
I'm going far enough that I'll be riding from now until dinner .
I slept well , ate well , and was happy .
Often , when I'm dulled by worry and melancholy , he lightens my mood with his merry pranks .
Murder !
To get what you want , you need to get Cassio out of the way .
He wouldn't say that .
No , we can just announce the actor's name , and let his face show through the lion costume , and have him say something himself .
Is this your idea of success ?
The wooing is like a Scottish jig : hot and fast and full of whimsy and illusion .
In the meantime I'll tell you all , as honestly as I confess my sins to God , how I wooed this beautiful lady , and how she came to love me .
Has the storm passed ?
What are you going to do ?
Why , what do you imagine his name to be ?
Pardon , dear father .
But when You take up your duties too cheerfully .
Tell me .
Then I'll see you again ?
The night air is too raw and cold for us to stay outdoors .
I can't wait to hear him call the drunkard "husband , " and to watch my men smother their laughter as they pay their respects to this simple peasant .
Oh , Antony !
Really , he won it from me once before in a dishonest game of dice .
I thought you were resolved to do this .
Welcome , dear Rosencrantz and Guildenstern .
I never , oh , what a mistake ! , revealed myself to him until half an hour ago , when I was in my armor .
So confess your sin freely now .
What's the news ?
Is there more news ?
And he's made the holiest vows to me , to back up what he says .
It's a measly little cap , a dessert crust , a plaything , a silk pie .
I'll have to tell the story again every month , since you seem to forget it .
What , in our own house ?
You see me standing here , Lord Bassanio .
How unlucky am I , having to apologize for doing the right thing !
He was graced with lots of natural gifts , he was young , valiant , wise , and no doubt meant to be king .
Did you leave on good terms ?
Let lightning spit fire !
If your affection for me doesn't convince you to come , don't let my letter do so." Oh , my darling , make your arrangements and go !
They are .
That's him .
More , please , more .
My sons Edward and Clarence !
Yes , he will , and the queen as well .
I'm sure there was a herd of lions nearby .
Don't I deserve more than this ?
I see you're all determined to gang up on me for a few laughs .
You do their work for them and give them good luck .
I'm the one who fathered those bloodsucking daughters .
I shook you and shouted at you , sir .
I'll fetch him .
Absolutely , yes indeed .
So you don't love me ?
He woke up the whole house with his loud and cowardly screams .
Throw some of your words at me .
Dear friends , let's go to bed .
He is , because he told Antonius to tell you he'd be there tomorrow .
Whatever we decide to do .
Give me your hand , Kate .
I've told cowards to turn their backs on me and run .
What , does your wife say you can come home ?
It's the same kind of guy who got you upset and made you suspect I'd cheated on you with the Moor .
Not good ones , please .
Come then , kiss me and take the last bit of warmth from my lips .
For there never was a pretty woman who didn't like to preen in the mirror .
And so far I'm pleased with the way things have turned out , since I find all of this commotion very entertaining .
All I'm asking for is to have that little human boy as part of my crew .
You thought because he didn't speak English like a native he couldn't handle an English club .
Tell us , Othello .
She's the devil .
Get up , get up , and look at this image of doomsday !
It's not yet daylight .
Come on , Antonio .
Then patiently listen to my impatience .
Farewell , everyone .
No one except her maid and a holy hermit .
Prepare your troops .
You know what you know .
Therefore tell me the Dauphin's mind frankly and without constraint .
I'd like to introduce you to my friend .
Baby blooms are most susceptible to disease .
Brutus" and "Caesar." What's so special about "Caesar" ?
But since the affairs of men are always uncertain , let's think about the worst that may happen .
Goodbye to you both .
I'll write to my stepson Richmond on your behalf , so that he'll meet you on the way .
Shut up , you doddering old wizard !
I could be convinced if I were like you .
I knew your father .
No , a whole share for me .
Quiet !
My name is Petruchio , son of Antonio , a man well known throughout Italy .
Are you on duty again tonight ?
But now I'll grit my teeth and kill anyone who tries to stop me .
Stay , Jaques , stay here for a bit .
Not a bit , madam .
A good reputation is the most valuable thing we have , men and women alike .
He's a very proper man .
I've got no hope that he survived .
We were pushed out of power by evil deeds , as you call them .
Quiet !
Well sir , they've lied ; moreover , they have said things that were not true ; secondarily , they are slanderers ; sixth and lastly , they have falsely accused a lady ; thirdly , they have confirmed things that did not in fact happen ; and , in conclusion , they are lying scoundrels .
You drank horses' urine and water from scum-covered puddles that even animals would refuse .
And there's nothing I can do about it .
Call the numbskull back in here .
Yes , I'm sure he's dead .
I'm well , and probably will be for a while , as I hear that four feasts are being prepared .
Who is this bloody man ?
Who can tell me who I am ?
Go , take it away and let your master make whatever use of it he can .
But , hang on !
I do dare , and I say that you are the villain .
Tonight in Harfleur we will be your guest ; tomorrow we'll march on .
Whip him , fellows , until he screws up his face like a baby and cries aloud for mercy !
The biggest clue is his seriousness .
Oh , how awful that a lady who's been rejected by one man should therefore be treated horribly by another one !
then I hope I have a life of misery !
The person who's poor and contented is rich enough .
Cassio doesn't know you .
Oh , are you here , Iago ?
My belongings are on the ship already .
There's no clock here in the forest .
I've made my choice .
Not someone who doesn't share that disposition , meaning Mark Antony .
But please , tell him how well I faked a faint .
That's the curse of military service .
I feel a lot better after talking to this guy .
I'll tear it up when it's paid .
I saw her , but I didn't notice her .
The glove which I have given him to wear may possibly win him a box on the ear .
And what a slug Hastings is that he hasn't even arrived to tell us whether they're coming !
I hope not .
No , my lord .
I want to go home .
I haven't slept since Cassius first began to turn me against Caesar .
Sheep pens are empty in the middle of the flooded fields , and the crows get fat from eating the dead bodies of infected sheep .
It's the truth .
I'll get him to come here , and you can ask him yourself .
The total due is about three ducats more than I owe this gentleman .
Who are you talking to ?
Do you want to know what I wrote ?
The clock says it's daytime , but dark night is strangling the sun .
The French have retreated , see , and there were great acts of courage .
Who's the spokesman for Edmund , Earl of Gloucester ?
If they do this , as they will , God willing , my ransom will soon be raised .
However , I'll do what I can for you .
How is Hamlet ?
Though our lives , We have decided , my lord .
I will , my lord .
His legs aren't great , but they're alright .
My good man Norfolk , hurry to your post .
is yours." And , though I say so in his presence , if he's not a friend of the best kings , you'll find him king of the best friends .
Where should we meet ?
So what if I killed her husband and her father ?
If you'd like to talk tomorrow , I'll come to your home .
Don't wake her .
Where are the noble Hastings , Rivers , Vaughan , Grey ?
He bids them good morning with a modest smile and calls
Hello , Roderigo !
Think about it .
I'll fish for you and get you plenty of firewood .
Sir , I'm half-blind .
Frightening looks are also at my service , as are fake smiles .
Because , my good king , England is so poorly led , her scepter so foolishly borne by a vain , silly , shallow , impulsive youth , that she's hardly a threat .
Didn't you clearly say "Knock , " "pound , " and "put your fists to work" ?
I could marry you there , gentle Hermia , where the strict laws of Athens can't touch us .
What ?
My noble brother !
Iago is gesturing for me to come closer .
Caesar ?
He has epilepsy , a disease where you fall down .
Master , master , I've been on the lookout so long , I'm ready to fall down dead , but I've got one , finally !
It would be just like a nice daydream or fantasy .
Oh , Regan , Goneril , your kind old father whose generous heart gave you everything , Oh , if I think about that I'll go mad .
I'll go and join my men .
Your Highness told me to ask for my commission today .
Say something .
I wouldn't dream of opposing such an obviously promising idea .
Well , let's get out of here and tell Macbeth what we did accomplish .
Good luck , sir .
Is this possible , my lord ?
You've won the wager , and I will add twenty thousand crowns to what they owe you .
For the same thing .
Maybe , but you're wrinkled all the same .
Looking toward England , we reminisced about the countless frightening experiences we'd had in the wars between the Yorks and the Lancasters .
We must not .
Shame , eternal shame , and nothing but shame !
If you got what you deserved , you would learn some respect .
Go away !
We'll never see each other again .
Lead the way , sir .
Know that I am Brutus !
Don't refuse the love we offer you .
Please , uncle , let's go in and ask your daughters to forgive you .
Now that he's old , we can expect to have to deal not only with his old character flaws , which have turned into deep-rooted habits , but also with the uncontrollable crabbiness that comes with old age .
Now I will have to send my humble proposal of peace to that young man .
When all these extraordinary things happen at once , we shouldn't say , "These happenings can be explained rationally .
Who can stain that name with a just accusation ?
Tell him to gather together the greatest army he can muster in a hurry and meet me right away at Salisbury .
All this so suddenly ? , Edmund , what's going on ?
A second Daniel ! , A Daniel , Jew !
He looks like someone with a strange tale to tell .
Macbeth !
Isn't that him ?
Who's there , in the other devil's name ?
The French have reinforced their scattered men .
I don't mean that she wants me because What's she like ?
In the end I grudgingly consented .
Do you know him ?
You call yourself my wife , yet you don't call me "husband" ?
What , are we having a feast ?
You'd break a date with your beloved by a whole hour ?
His faults were equally matched by his virtues .
It's fair for him to treat me like this , very fair .
Yes , with Cassio .
The sails were dyed purple , and they were perfumed so heavily that they made the air seem dizzy with love .
Horatio , tell me something .
In a half an hour he'll be asleep .
But Caesar ignores offers that don't give him an advantage , and so should you .
If she returns my jewels , I'll stop pursuing her and apologize to her .
Do you think it would work ?
If it were , you would find me such an ordinary king that you would think I'd sold my farm to buy my crown .
I , sir , am Dromio .
Don't give it away .
But where's the money ?
All right , then .
You think you can get rid of me that easily ?
The English army is near , led by Malcolm , his uncle Siward , and the good Macduff .
I won't be a soldier anymore .
Either we go after Pompey or he'll come after us .
Can't you see I'm eating ?
Be wise when you criticize me and keep your minds alert so you can judge me fairly .
They're friends , Ratcliffe and Lovell .
Speak , Claudio , that's your cue .
The same to you , my lord !
Well , I won't take it any longer .
Thank you .
Yes , him , woman .
Young man , your father's dead .
He'll just turn it into a joke and torment the poor woman even more .
Hurry , hurry , prepare my horse .
If I repeated it to you , it would kill you as soon as you heard it .
Do you lie so low ?
Damn your stones for disappointing me like this !
Your answers are too shallow and too hasty .
Hurry up , Audrey , hurry. , I'm coming , I'm coming .
You speak absolutely correctly , sir .
You'll get some of what you want .
I won't speak to her .
Welcome , my lord .
And this is why your servants hang their heads in sorrow !
With that I kiss your hand and call you my queen .
We won't hold back any of our wisdom .
I've shut the memory of your beautiful eyes out of my heart .
Do you want to sink ?
She can't hurt you , Helena .
I meant a crowbar .
Is it fashionable now for neglected fathers to get so little pity ?
Here comes Oberon .
It's a bet .
More of us are here .
Then pack up your instruments and go away .
Let me go with you to Belmont .
If you cut both their throats , then you are the absolute best .
I'll be no king of England if I'm not also king of France .
What were you before this ?
Yes .
Is this true ?
But soon I'll see the gods punish you for your lack of respect to your father .
Lady Beatrice is angry with you .
That must mean a sword .
I'm yours forever .
But if I really laid him bare , I'd have to weep and hang my head , and you would not believe me , his behavior is so shocking .
Monster , use your fingers .
My father loved Sir Rowland as much as he loved his own soul , and the rest of the world shared my father's opinion .
Help me .
They say that this town is full of deception , illusionists that can fool the eye , dark sorcerers who can bewitch your mind , soul-killing witches who can disfigure your body , disguised swindlers , fast-talking fakers , and all kinds of other unchecked sins .
The duke of Exeter has held the bridge very gallantly .
Let my sorrow have the upper hand .
He's definitely the most active gentleman of France .
How's the night going , boy ?
Howl , howl , howl , howl !
Are you mad ?
To work for you , sir .
You may come across better food , but not a warmer welcome .
It eats and sleeps and has the same five senses we do .
Bring me his answers quickly .
Do you see ?
My dagger , little nephew ?
If you send them word that you won't come , they might change their minds .
Lead's too crass to hold her .
I gave him the material .
No , Cassius , no .
I'm beginning to understand what you want me to do .
Murder !
Madam , I'd better leave now .
What's wrong ?
No , let me say some good things about you while I'm in the mood .
Lord Babyface over there will meet me in a duel , and good luck to him then .
Is Claudio your enemy ?
The man who gives away his crust and his crumbs Will discover that he needs some crumbs back .
If the devil had such a beautiful house as his body , then good things would fight to live in it .
Go up there and second his petition .
It's the same with men .
What's the matter ?
I've always had great respect for your destiny .
The tiring journey seems to have made you gloomy .
Let me see what he looks like , so when I see another man who resembles him , I'll know to avoid him .
None of us .
Sir , he should have as many as Caesar has .
Please say no more .
Or , if you don't mind , come to my home , and I'll wait for you .
Would you care to hear some music ?
He won't catch a wink of sleep , either at night or during the day .
He's as ugly in his manners as he is in appearance. , I will indeed .
I never saw a better-designed gown , more elegant and pleasing and well made .
It would be better if they were all on his father's side , or that there were none at all on his father's side .
Don't be upset .
The duke's trumpets .
Good-bye , kind Charmian .
I swear , he'll be food for the crows soon .
Snakes shed their skin there , and the shed skin is wide enough to wrap a fairy in .
All right , have it your way .
Stop hollering , man !
of patience .
Oh , what a world this is , when even what is beautiful in a man poisons him !
I don't even know him .
Ah , he got you back , Benedick !
Everything would be produced without labor , and would be shared by all .
I'm out of breath , sir .
The ship was already sailing .
Pardon us , dear father .
Oh , noble Caesar !
You don't need eyes to see how the world works .
But goodbye .
Richard .
Stop fooling around .
Please , master , tell me .
Your Grace heard their saccharine words , but didn't take note of their poisonous intentions .
Shall we get started ?
Give me your hand .
Give me my armor .
Who offered him the crown ?
Do you smell something naughty ?
Will you have me ?
Here come two of Duke Senior's pages .
Neither can my accomplishments at sea .
Yes , Casca .
Stay close by when we wake him up , ma'am .
I've practiced Stoicism with as much devotion as you , but I still couldn't bear this news like you do .
What quality is that , my lord ?
Stay there and fortify it well against the French .
Take me off to jail ?
Good morning , my friends .
His horse is better than the Neapolitan's and he frowns more than the Count Palatine .
You're a fool .
Now let my courage prove my title as wife .
And could you please take my servant to old Shylock's house ?
What a shameless jerk you are to pretend you don't know me !
You won't be striking me down , but defeating Caesar .
Will you meet me right away at Ninny's grave ?
We did , my lord , weeping and carrying on about the sobbing deer .
I'm telling you , it's hers .
Never , my lord .
Well , to be on the safe side , so I don't go back on my promise , I plan to get myself married to a wealthy widow within the next three days .
You are my love , my love , I think .
The one the Moor gave to Desdemona , which you asked me to steal so many times .
Good morning , neighbor Baptista .
Speak .
My heart feels like it's full of poisonous snakes !
I can't enjoy either of them as long as the other one's alive .
That's a good point .
You're as wise as you are beautiful .
Come on , shovel .
And would I have ever done that to you ?
Thirty ships .
And my heart too .
Promise me you'll let me live , and I'll confess the truth .
What does the silver one say ?
How are you , madam ?
Listen to Antony .
No one else would .
Who pronounced this death sentence before a court of law could even convict me ?
He has a ring of mine , worth forty ducats , and he promised to give me a necklace in exchange for it .
If you like what you see of the land , the profit that's possible , and this rustic life , I'll be your faithful servant , and buy the place with your gold right away .
They left me and my servant there , tied together .
You're right , Charmian .
Listen !
Why did he do that ?
The Jew will have justice .
It's a skull with a scroll in its empty eye socket .
It's as complete a work of villainy as any that could be thought up .
So , so , so , so !
Speak up and tell me !
Here's a sick man who wants to speak with you .
Why , what's the matter ?
Ely joining Richmond troubles me more than Buckingham and his quickly assembled army .
Death and damnation !
She has the patience of a I'll see you hanged on Sunday first !
Hurry , send someone immediately !
Go to him from me .
Where's that snake ?
Well , then , there !
Indeed , honor is what I want to talk to you about .
Very obedient , keep crying. , Concerning this , oh , what fake emotion ! , I am being ordered home , Get away from me , I'll send for you later. , Sir , I'll obey the order and return to Venice .
You might as well do the impossible rather than try to soften his Jewish heart .
Nearest his heart." , Those are the very words .
Good point , Decius .
I'll wait for her here and when she comes I'll take a novel approach with her .
Name him .
Why , are we turning to men ?
What was it that you told me today , that your niece Beatrice was in love with Signior Benedick ?
Whoever is already married ( except one person I know ) will stay married , all but one person .
He should swear by his two-faced self , and that's an oath I'll believe !
But you've raised me as a peasant , hiding from me what I needed to become a gentleman .
Do you work in this house ?
I pulled it from his wound .
Where , where ?
What about it ?
I have done wrong , so I will suffer wrong .
Where are you , Demetrius , you arrogant bastard ?
Come , let's continue on toward your father's house .
My deep trust in him made him deeply untrustworthy , arousing in him a treachery as big as my trust was , my trust which had no limit , an infinite confidence .
Then I'll listen to her .
If you refuse to allow me to do so , your city's charter and its freedom are endangered .
Yes , my master .
Yes , a dozen of them , as many as there are women in the world , in fact .
I've been transformed somehow , haven't I , master ?
I want you to see the difference between us , so I pardon you even before you ask for a pardon .
All right , then .
Oh , right , good Catesby .
It seems he has taken great care to please his wife .
Let us leave everything and give our vineyards to the barbarous nation .
The truth will be all the inheritance you get .
What do you think about him , Cassio ?
If I ever see it , I will challenge you .
Well , there they are .
What do you think I've got on my head ?
Or maybe , to make it even more lovely , I'll sing it when the heroine dies .
If you choose the one that contains my picture , we'll be married right away .
I think he will stand strong with us .
Please , Horatio , go with him .
What does he say ?
Get them in here , Nathaniel , Joseph , Nicholas , Philip , Walter , Sugarsop , and the rest .
You should say , "I sort of know him , but not well .
Yes , I am .
Big , round tears ran piteously down the animal's innocent nose .
I knew a girl who was married in an afternoon as she went to the garden for parsley to stuff a rabbit .
You'll live in luxury with Gremio .
Draw your sword , scoundrel , or I'll slice your thighs like flank steak .
So I'll have nothing to do with that gaudy gold box , it's like the gold that Midas couldn't eat .
The world is a bad place , where you can't speak what you know .
It's Casca , I know your voice .
Am I sorry that I only had one child ?
I'm going to take it from you now .
Ready .
But this whole thing is strange .
I saw a thousand shipwrecks , a thousand men whom fish had gnawed to the bone , huge anchors , chunks of gold , heaps of pearls , and precious jewels , all scattered on the bottom of the sea .
Oh , my , it's my husband .
I'm not .
Excuse me , young man , how do I get to the Jew's residence ?
We'll have celebration feasts for each other before we go our separate ways .
Our guiding light is out .
Find out who did it !
Their illness confounds the most advanced techniques of modern medicine , but when he touches them , they heal immediately because of the power granted to him by heaven .
You will .
No , I don't , my lord .
I saw the handkerchief .
Oh , Master , master , look !
I sent you a letter while you were carousing in Alexandria .
Your grave is gaping open , and your death is near .
Go and put on your own armor .
He'll be done in time .
If anyone doubts this , let him put me on trial .
I am willing to fight you if I must .
I admit that in front of you , my lady , she keeps a bit quiet .
She can't even imagine what "love" is .
Who's that ?
What is your news ?
I beg you , listen well .
They're lying over there , and the poor old man , their father , weeps so piteously over them that the whole audience has joined him in grieving .
Watch Cassius .
We have slashed the snake but not killed it .
I wish that were true for both our sakes !
Let me shake your hand .
We must preserve our goodwill toward each other and not break into factions again .
A wise man and a fool .
I hope that God restores you to health .
Run to the Capitol and nothing else ?
He's dressed like a freak , a total freak , and not at all like a proper footman or a gentleman's valet .
Claribel , his daughter .
What does he say about Brutus ?
Look how your servants wait on you , each one ready to do whatever you command .
Who's taken over the watch for you ?
I felt like skipping school , sir .
Knock .
It would be inappropriate , dangerous , even , for me to be seen working against the Moor , as I would if I stayed .
And from now on , when you get hot with me , I'll assume it's your mother speaking and leave it at that .
I beg the court to deliver the verdict .
Goodbye .
I hope he is , but mothers get to have their doubts .
I'll do it , but I don't like it .
He who chooses me must give and risk all he has." Must give everything , for what ?
Take this !
What are you doing , old man ?
Greetings , Caesar , my lord !
I know the boy will be a convincing gentlewoman , taking up her exact walk and talk and gentle gestures .
The rest of the king's guests are already inside .
We don't want it at our festivities .
I swear by this hand that I love you .
No , master , I've been changed in both mind and body .
Give him your arm .
What a tunneler !
They're such oversexed gluttons that I feel like we're living in a pub or a whorehouse rather than a respectable palace .
Thank you , sir .
The duke and senators of Venice greet you .
Sir John Falstaff .
Yes , my lord .
What can I tell you ?
Decius Brutus doesn't love you .
Your case is better than that .
My sweet husband , I did not lock you out .
Are you backing away in fear ?
As far as I know , he's okay and will arrive here soon .
I know it's the moon .
What a crazy island this is .
Now let me tell you , Casca , I have already convinced some of the noblest Romans to join me in an honorable but dangerous mission .
He gave Syria , Cilicia , and Phoenicia to Ptolemy .
In Rome , Madam .
Welcome , my lord .
Your father's sons would make excellent husbands , if only a girl could catch one for herself .
You're going to rest while you're still damned ?
How else is he the "man in the moon" ?
Tomorrow is the happy day , Audrey .
Don't delay , Caesar .
It's still waving to me .
I'll do whatever the king wants .
Hello , sir .
If you ever had a mother , come in quickly to Sir John .
I'll reward you for your troubles .
Oh , you villain , villain , you damned , smiling villain !
I hope lightning strikes her in the eyes !
But go away now .
Will you two help them get ready ?
You liar , you're turning my heart to stone , and making me call what I'll do murder , when I had been thinking of it as a sacrifice !
These cowards manage to make fools of brave men .
My only sin was loving you too much .
Carved it up and down like an apple tart ?
No , most likely .
The news is true , my lord .
Then make a circle around Caesar's corpse , and let me show you the man who made this will .
It may be that his antagonist is a gentleman of very high degree , quite outside of his own sphere .
But if you live to see yourself similarly denied your rights , this foolish patience will abandon you .
What do you mean , beside yourself ?
Lecherous Cleopatra , may all the charms of love soften those withered lips !
Look , Don Pedro has come back for you .
Amen .
But don't you see what a Did you hear someone ?
There's more knocking .
What's that sound ?
Oh , how bitter it is that Edward , the real "true , noble prince" , should still be alive !
Come sit on me .
Give me some light !
Remind Richard of this , and he will weep .
Farewell .
And a bad singer , my lord .
To be good-looking is a matter of luck , but to read and write is a natural gift .
No , you must see them as your father sees them .
Can you stay awake a bit longer and play a few tunes on your lute ?
She hangs around me all the time .
I do too , my lord .
Then hear me , gracious sovereign , and all you peers who owe your lives and duty to this imperial throne .
That's another sin arising from your ignorance : you bring ewes and rams together and make your living by their copulation .
I'm going to go drown myself .
I hear their drums .
It's bitterly cold out , and I'm depressed .
You rudely snuck out of bed .
You bring your cauldrons , your spells , your charms , and everything else .
How are you , Guildenstern ?
Let's go , Tom .
Are you a married man or a bachelor ?
What kept you from telling him this ?
What you were afraid of has happened .
No , don't cry , kind Eros .
Bring ink and paper , Charmian .
Yes , Captain , but with this acknowledgement , that God fought for us .
If I could get my hands on you , I'd make you care .
You will always be welcome to me .
What is your wish with regard to her ?
The other half goes to the state .
Oh , that's a good wish !
I'm forty-eight .
I know he wouldn't be a wolf if the Romans didn't act like sheep .
My dear master , my captain , my sovereign , let me say before I strike this fatal blow : farewell .
You've lost your resolve .
I'll get my revenge before I leave this house .
Why , she's a lamb , a dove , a child compared to him !
It's just my bad luck .
I'll wait patiently .
My Lord Constable , are those stars or suns I saw on the armor in your tent tonight ?
I thought that thing you're talking about was a man .
I'm not Lear .
What else ?
Claim fair England's peace depends on this alliance .
Your I mean my daughter is my flesh and blood .
I'd never do such a bad thing , not for the whole world !
We'll leave , Brutus .
I don't know what to think about this .
Excuse me , sir. , Tom's chilly .
We'll get married at some point , Audrey .
They still haven't joined the battle .
A kind good night to all !
This is his sword .
Oh , Lord , this makes me laugh !
But , oh , it makes me bitter to look at happiness through another man's eyes .
Sit between us .
Oh , a thousand times worse , a thousand times , and what a sweet personality she has !
Oh , I wish you'd never been born !
All the rumors have been confirmed .
It would be hard , almost impossible .
But I'm sorry , I'm not allowed to let you visit them .
Hello , sir .
It means being faithful and ready to serve , just like I am for Phoebe .
Master Constable , you're going about this all wrong .
Don't say that , Lysander .
Don't worry about the consequences .
Your misery will make them sharp and piercing like mine .
Swear by her foot , so she can stamp out the oath .
Why are you so strong and good ?
What's the matter ?
And then he'll , he'll , wait , what was I about to say ?
Ah , you're here ? , Come on , gentlemen , let's go !
And what's the point , sir ?
Now leave me alone , as I said .
A king , perhaps , My lord , How is it that the prophet didn't tell me at the time that I would kill him ?
Is your master coming ?
Please let me go .
Stop advising me ; your words pass through my ears like water through a sieve .
I came from Corinth , Your Highness .
Do you really think so ?
Killed ?
We've got to act fast , my lord of the fairies .
I think this applause is for some new honors awarded to Caesar .
Happy with Hermia ?
Oh , my lord , my lord , forgive my panic !
Sir , I'm upset .
Sometimes the expression on her face tells me she likes me .
Clearly , men should not go out walking too late !
Two great enemies , in fact , enemies to my peace of mind .
Well , onward , then .
Oh , that splendid Caesar !
Come here , boy .
Oh no , good Cassio !
But here's an old , true saying : "If you want to win France , start with Scotland." For when the eagle England leaves her nest to seek prey , the weasel Scot always comes sneaking around to suck dry her princely eggs and , like the mouse when the cat's away , destroy more than she can actually eat .
There's going to be a storm .
Stay !
Don't make me wait for dinner even a moment .
Cheer up , Antonio !
If it pleases Caesar to be so good to himself as to hear me , I'll try to get him to do what's good for him .
And this is Metellus Cimber .
She is welcome to stay .
But here comes Antony .
No , Orlando , men are like April when they're wooing a girl , young , and passionate , but like December once they're married and their passions have cooled .
Bless your five senses !
I'm sure the duke will never allow this contract to be enforced .
Get a little sleep .
No , it heals gradually .
I see a voice !
You bastard workhorse drudge !
Look at the three little dogs , Tray , Blanch , and Sweetheart , all barking at me .
What's the matter ?
Someone who makes a promise and breaks it .
I should think that your appetite would act like a clock ( as mine does ) and bring you home on its own , without the need for a messenger .
Peter , did you ever see anything like it ?
But he's got to build churches for that to happen , my lady , or else he'll have to put up with being forgotten , like the hobby-horse in the popular song that goes , "Heigh-ho , heigh-ho , the hobby-horse is forgotten." What does this mean , my lord ?
Fortune is happy today and , in this mood , will give us anything we want .
Don't be cruel , Demetrius .
Easy , Petruchio .
Oh , and I know who loves him .
Yes , for your own safety , you should deny one thing : you have been a great thief at sea .
Because she's been chosen by Signior Hortensio .
Yes , as you and the rest will find out as soon as he's home .
Call the messenger in .
Henry Lord Scroop of Masham , I arrest you for high treason .
I'll always be loyal to you , sir .
Knowing how much I loved my books , he gave me some books from my library that I value more than my dukedom .
That's all I want , and I'll do anything to accomplish it .
If he's ready now , so am I .
To die , to sleep , to sleep , maybe to dream .
Charles did the same to the second brother , and the third .
What's this ?
And what about him , Tranio ?
If our father were dead you'd receive half of his revenue forever , and you'd have my undying love , Edgar." Hmm , what's this , a conspiracy ?
As moral as me !
Will it ?
How can it seem like I'm making fun of you , when my tears prove that I'm sincere ?
What's up , man ?
If you had any sense of pity , or manners , you wouldn't pretend to fight over me like this .
Let this anger sharpen your sword .
Is there a scale here to weigh the flesh ?
They can't move till you release them .
So go away .
He's in his chambers now , and he's extremely upset .
You do your job well .
Often I have heard of "sanctuary men , " but until now I've never heard of "sanctuary children." My lord , you've won me over this time .
No , you have to forget all that now .
Ah , revenge !
The owl made noise all night .
Come on .
Take a good look , and you'll see that one of the three men who rule the world has turned into a whore's jester .
Here , madam .
Then I guess the whole world is one .
But taste my story , and relish it by paying attention .
I had a scar here that looked like a "T" ; now it's an "H." They're retreating .
I don't even know how much I'm spending to find them .
And I had to be away !
Do you want to know the truth ?
This would be enough to make my husband suspect me , if he wasn't so free of jealousy .
And , my dear sister , as long as the winds are blowing and ships are sailing , let me hear from you , write .
If they could purge their guilt simply by saying that they were innocent , they'd all be as innocent as God Himself .
Good lieutenant , is your general married ?
God be with you all .
That's just what he said in the letter .
It wouldn't be right for me to tell you everything I've seen and heard .
I'll drink it if I like .
You can refuse to make me your spouse , but I'll be your servant whether you want me to or not .
Pray , let me stay .
I can't explain it .
Antonio !
Don't tell us what our duty is .
If she glares , I'll say her brow is as clear as roses newly washed with morning dew .
Where ?
I had a dream last night about the three witches .
Order supplies for your trip and choose your traveling companions .
What's the news !
Master , if you eat with her , bring really long silverware .
From what , in God's name ?
Your Grace does me as great an honor as could be wished by any of his subjects .
Good friends , go in and have some wine with me .
A drum !
There has never been a widow who suffered such loss as me .
Great Duke , be merciful to mortal men .
Will you come with me ?
I'll do it right away .
Take it and do that for me , and leave me alone for a while .
Don't say that .
Just watch !
Quiet !
Caesar is listening .
We used to think so too .
Quiet !
Tell him to bring his pen and his inkwell to the jail .
Go immediately , and do exactly as I wrote down .
My comfort is that old age , that poor preserver of beauty , can't make my face any worse than it already is .
You have .
I'm not sure , my lord .
Those who have known how bad things are here on earth .
Then lay that sentence on me too , my lord .
If knives , poison , or snakes have edge , effect , or venom , I am safe from that fate .
To tell the truth , though , I think the duke hasn't lost a single man , except for one who will probably be executed for robbing a church , one Bardolph , I don't know if your Majesty knows the man .
That's my sister .
Here , drink to me .
Lepidus flatters both of them , as they flatter him , but he doesn't love them , and they don't love him .
Where are they ?
What are you talking about ?
I will , as surely as I am a gentleman .
What , all my children and their mother dead in one fell swoop ?
Well , you can go now .
There must be a strange explanation for this , if it's true .
Not tonight , today .
But how long will "ever" last ?
He doesn't long for the dawn as we do .
His military understanding is all theory , no practice .
And my poor He's fainted. , My lord , my lord !
You must all keep up this united front .
God defend and guard us innocents against them !
They have me tied to a stake .
I'll make Oliver find him .
The next hailstone should hit Caesarion , until one by one all my children , and every one of my brave Egyptians , are killed by the dissolving of this pellet storm and lie unburied , covered by gnats and flies .
She went from me , who loved her with the dignity and devotion that suits a legitimate marriage , to a wretch whose natural gifts were poor compared to mine .
Dear Bassanio , my ships have all been wrecked .
You should ask instead if it's possible that any criminal could be so rich .
Do you know Captain Gower ?
Or ask you to leave the room ?
Still , it stands to reason that he mustn't betray his fear , as it might dishearten his army .
Listen , in books they say that true love always faces obstacles .
I'm sure he's somewhere on the island .
It's Orlando , who triumphed over both the wrestler and you in the same instant .
But the enemy is loud .
It's like this : as long as a person tells me the truth , even though it means my death , I will listen as though he praised me .
Judging from his appearance , I bet he can tell us the latest news about the revolt .
You can trust me .
Where is that knocking coming from ?
What an excellent idea , he'll soak up the wine !
How many times will Caesar bleed again in show , though he now lies at the base of Pompey's statue , as worthless as dust !
Oh , Charmian , I will never leave this tomb !
Lucius !
That's a good point .
He had one yesterday .
I'm backed into a corner with nowhere to run .
Now , your gown ?
No more , please .
Thank you , brave Cassio .
Okay , to the point .
Let rivers flood and fiends howl for food !
Good to see you , Master Antipholus .
When Caesar was alive , even he wouldn't dare anger me like this .
Get off the field , my lord .
Musicians , come in !
Why , dear child ?
How did she get that candle ?
Are you ?
There may be a time for everything , but no man who has gone bald naturally can get his hair back .
I know you .
Hush , Hortensio .
Then that's the way it may turn out .
Reborn .
There's no place I'd rather die than here by Caesar , and no manner of death would please me more than being stabbed by you , the masters of this new era .
Please lie down and rest a while , my lord .
Even if I had sworn never to marry , I wouldn't trust myself to keep that promise if Hero would marry me .
Carriage" makes it sound like it's pulling around a cannon .
They were paid to betray their master .
When devoutly religious men are praying , it's hard to draw them out of it , because they get lost in the wonder of their contemplation .
Who knows what the Lord Protector thinks ?
Let him hoist you up in front of the shouting crowds !
If I don't love her , I'm completely
Oh God !
You liar , you respond better to the whip than to kindness !
Oh , go , leave me .
Then get to work , poison !
Is this a dagger I see in front of me , with its handle pointing toward my hand ?
Is your little pearl in there ?
Cheer up and be at peace .
When good orators finish talking , they spit ; when lovers do ( God help us if they ever do ) , they kiss .
Then leave him out .
I don't believe it .
I won't say a word .
I'll say you're not feeling well .
Then it's confirmed !
Really ?
Cleopatra , Do you think there ever was , or could there ever be , a man such as the one I dreamed about ?
Did you call , my lord ?
These are the messengers from my sister and the king .
But did I fall or not ?
He's at the duke's morning and night , accusing the state of harming free trade if they deny him justice .
Am I not wise ?
Maybe some merchant at the marketplace invited him home for lunch .
And I was right , because where's your husband now ?
Farewell .
Captain Macmorris , when we have more leisure , see , I will be so bold as to show you I know about the practice of warfare , and that's that .
Isn't that enough ?
Gentlemen , I hope you are well .
She's cheating on me ?
My father-in-law lives closer to the marketplace .
Let them last forever .
Where did you hear this ?
Oh , noble fool !
Like love , my lord , before it learns to love .
Who is this ?
No doubt the murderous knife was blunt till it was sharpened on your stony heart , you reveled in my lambs ' bloody guts .
And who are you , good sir ?
I love you all the more for not liking it .
Out , out , brief candle .
I gave it to Dromio , who rushed in for it .
Get away from me , you ass !
And who can help thinking how monstrous it was for Malcolm and Donalbain to kill their gracious father ?
Give him this money and these letters , Reynaldo .
If it looks like my good father , I'll speak to it , even if Hell itself opens up and tells me to be quiet .
Lysander , say something !
Anger does not protect the angry well .
You know from my clothing who I am .
May God in His mercy forgive you .
It was Kent , sir , the exiled Kent , who , after the king treated him like an enemy of the state , put on a disguise and followed his king , carrying out tasks unworthy of even a slave .
You will never be able to say the same about me .
That she did .
We'll all join hands and sing , and bless this place with our fairy grace .
What a sad sight !
They tell me he died well , and settled his scores .
Get yourself to a convent , at once .
I don't know .
I'm indebted to you .
More or less .
Come with me now , and help me out .
How did you know what happened to your poor father ?
I would have met you by sea and again by land .
You're bothering me .
Cleopatra summoned him .
Oh , let me speak !
Doesn't Benedick deserve as much luck with a mate as he would have with Beatrice ?
Affection ! " That's nothing !
Did you hear her speak ?
Dear sir , I pity the lady and wish , more for her sake than my own , that I was more able to help her .
I have to go .
All these friends are my witnesses , so I swear to you , I swear by your beautiful eyes , in which I see myself reflected , Did you hear that !
Answer me .
Well , then , put your sword away .
A Roman .
A good name .
Of course I hear it .
Everyone join hands .
Not even trivial things were left out .
Or just a foretaste of it ?
I will , Caesar .
Here he comes .
His virtue is not hidden .
I'll tell you truly what I think about the king in my heart .
My brother has a daughter who looks exactly like Hero ; this girl is heir to both our estates .
Can't you somehow use your dissatisfaction to your own advantage ?
Separate them .
Do you hear what I'm saying , Iago ?
Goodbye , then .
So , tell us , did you see that thing again tonight ?
I'm all right .
Can we have some water please here ? , Come and wash , Kate , make yourself at home .
Who are you ?
I got him to leave , and made up an excuse for your trance .
Was it long or round ?
Receive all the blessings of a happy father .
Now I know better .
That young man who was just here .
Don't come again to ask for my ransom , good messenger .
Why did you do that ?
Will you surrender and avoid all this or be called to account for the destruction of this town ?
Liberty !
They're pretty busy in there .
Like a good doctor .
Not the Adam from the garden of Eden , but the Adam from the jailhouse .
You don't know that ?
Will it be in thunder , lightning , or rain ?
Will you cry ?
Pray well , father .
An important droplet is hanging from the corner of the moon .
How dare I ?
Don't harp on that point , madam , it's past .
Oh , no !
For lawyers on vacation , because they sleep their holidays away , with no sense of how time moves .
I'm wounded .
To invite my former boss , the Jew , to dine tonight with my new master , the Christian .
Madam wife , they say I've been dreaming or asleep for more than fifteen years .
That's what I conceive of him .
I've said too much in telling you of it .
Your honor is the reason you are leaving .
Let me be your servant .
No eyes in your head til there's money in your wallet ?
There was a time when I would have been terrified by a shriek in the night , and the hair on my skin would have stood up when I heard a ghost story .
I'll forbid all ships from leaving our harbors .
If I break the door down , slave , you'll be sorry for this .
Ah , here she comes , angry and sad .
The Prince and Claudio are hurrying this way .
What is your name , young man ?
Do you know the boy who was just speaking to me ?
Be quick about it .
Cobweb .
I don't feel like going .
Someone knocks .
What kind of loyalty is this ?
Look at me crying , what a fool I am to cry at what makes me happy .
Be patient , because you're staying with me .
Are you beautiful ?
I told you before , and I'll tell you again and again : I hate the Moor .
Gonzalo is a miracle-worker .
Don't you think so ?
When he raised his arm in command , the world trembled .
Who do you obey here ?
Antonio will guarantee it , hmmm .
What are these things we're looking at , my lord Antonio ?
Because of me ?
There we go !
Did you notice how the queen's guilty relatives turned pale when they heard about Clarence's death ?
He is positively stuffed with honorable virtues .
Hurry up , my Jewish friend .
You're a pustule , a sore , a tumor digesting my bloodline .
Oh , I'm out of breath from this foolish chase .
My door is locked .
Go back again , to be beaten home again ?
There's something downright unnatural about it , if a philosopher stopped to think about it .
I know the man a bit .
Where did you learn that song , Fool ?
This is rebellion .
If only my prayers could inspire that kind of affection !
One of our ships has reported that it saw most of their fleet shipwrecked .
The Moor himself is still at sea .
There , Diomedes , there .
They have fully sixty thousand fighting men .
I'll write him a taunting letter , and you can deliver it .
Picture the cabin boys climbing around the rigging .
Come , tailor , show it to us .
In God's name , who are you ?
How clever of you .
And mine say a hundred and forty .
I'd rather bear with you than Well , this is the Forest of Arden .
But the way he's divided the kingdom recently , nobody can tell which of the dukes he favors more .
Let those who will hear me speak stay .
If you were my fool , uncle , I'd have you beaten for getting old before your time .
My hands are tainted if they hit an inferior , especially since I myself am the cause of my own distress .
I am .
Sometimes the love my subjects bring me is inconvenient , but I still accept it as love .
When devils are about to commit their biggest sins they put on their most heavenly faces , just like I'm doing now .
This tyrant , whose mere name is so awful it hurts us to say it , was once considered an honest man .
Everyone's there except Metellus Cimber , and he's gone to look for you at your house .
This is what happens when you visit whores .
Hot , hot and moist .
He thinks highly of me .
Oh , was she now ?
And to hell with drowning yourself !
Oh , you streetwalker !
Please , I'm asking you , go ahead and get back to your state affairs .
If Echo were as fast , he would be worth a dozen like Belman .
Look !
I hope God makes you happy again , like you once were .
Oh , my poor Rosalind , where will you go ?
Sneaky , dried-up old coot !
Or you can pretend to settle your differences until this matter with Pompey is finished .
What we have to worry about is a full-scale invasion from Scotland , always an unreliable neighbor .
Fine , but not enough .
Do you see something wrong with that ?
But not in heaven .
I'll be back soon , and if I haven't brought you anything to eat , I will give you permission to die .
My dearest sister !
Because that's what you are now .
If its juice is put on someone's eyelids while they're asleep , that person will fall in love with the next living creature he or she sees .
Farewell .
Tell us what happened today that put Caesar in such a serious mood .
Oh , what an excellent thing this learning is !
I tell you , man , it's better for me , too , than the last time we met here .
I can tell by how pale and deathlike they look .
But it'd take a miracle to make me believe she could do anything that horrible .
Good .
I wish they'd fight in fire or in the air .
Go get it and bring it to me here in the orchard .
And I departed in a rage , right ?
In Algiers , sir .
If he has a face like yours , a good scratching couldn't make him look any worse .
So come with me .
I tell you , I'll either make him eat some part of this leek or give him a four-day head-bashing. , Go on , bite .
I didn't see him .
Banquo and Donalbain , Malcolm !
Where is my wife ?
Hope with good cause is swift ; it flies as fast as a swallow .
Will you dine with me tomorrow ?
Oh-ho-ho , sir !
Don't you realize the duke has also banished me , his daughter ?
And if the enemy is an ass and a fool and a prating idiot , does that mean , you think , that we should also be an ass and a fool and a prating idiot ?
It's not quite that simple .
What , that's all ?
You really don't recognize me , father ?
Are these wind instruments ?
Kill Brutus and be honored by the killing .
Can't any prayers reach your heart ?
I've already told you quite plainly that my daughter will never marry you .
God bless you .
If you go outside , arm yourself .
They all fell asleep together , as if they'd planned it .
Yes , ma'am .
Quiet !
Just remember to grab his books first , since without them he's just a poor fool like me , and can't command a single spirit .
Let's have one , good soldier .
Worse and worse !
You're the one I have to obey .
No sir , trust me , I do not .
If he's caught , he'll never make trouble for anyone again .
I mean I will live on whatever I get , like birds do .
It's not in the contract .
That way Antony will feel like he's fighting his own men .
It is .
By Jove that thunders !
Awaken the memory of those valiant ancestors and with your own powerful arm make their deeds live again .
You stupid fool !
We will do the same .
He acts like a man in love .
Put a candle in my study , Lucius .
If we happen to offend you , it's because we want to .
Give him this letter .
What did he do when you saw him ?
Don't provoke me any further or I'll forget to restrain myself .
Come with us , Lepidus .
I was reminded of my son , even though I despised my son at that time .
She'll be here soon , just like her letter said .
We have And one of them is the criminal Deformed .
Don't say what you're thinking , and don't be too quick to act on what you think .
Go ahead .
If I took the kingdom from your sons , I'll give it to your daughter to make up for it .
Oh , what a villain I am !
Her
That's what's clever about it .
Who , Hero ?
As eagerly as I ever came from school .
Afraid that your anger would not subside , she sent you word she was dead .
And to me , Denmark is a prison .
We've been waiting a long time for this day .
What's happening now , Lucillius ?
By the Lord who raised me to this weighty post from the happy and carefree life I used to enjoy , I promise you I never did anything to get the king to turn against the duke of Clarence .
But I reversed the death sentence .
How did my master die , Strato ?
Shall I put it plainly ?
Your highness , I want nothing more than what you've already offered .
That was my turquoise ring !
For we may take pity on you , even if we can't pardon you .
Where did you leave him ?
The gentleman she danced with told her you insulted her .
We might as well send orders to the whale to come ashore as try to restore order in soldiers carried away with their looting .
It's the tragedy of our times that lunatics must lead the blind .
I can only say this about her : if she looked different than she does , she would be ugly , and since she can't be anything but herself , I don't like her .
Give him my respects , and tell him I'll definitely be there for dinner , since I know he has gone to great lengths for this meal .
The king has just honored me , and I have earned the good opinion of all sorts of people .
And since our quarrel is with his future behavior , not what he does now , I must frame the argument like this : if his position is furthered , his character will fulfill these predictions .
What are you going to do now ?
Are these spirits we see before us ?
Oh , he's really gone .
Stop , brave lady , stop !
Yes , we talked for a couple of hours .
Don't worry .
If you dressed only to stay warm , you wouldn't need these gorgeous clothes you're wearing , which don't keep you warm at all .
But he's sleeping .
Then the wrong man is dead , and sweet revenge has gone wrong .
Please , don't forget to leave me a tip .
I'll meet you there in an hour .
I'd be wasting my skills dealing with an idiot like that if I couldn't get something useful out of him .
I'm afraid you'll keep going until then .
Is there any more , or is that it ?
Well , even if he is her father , I'm sure she wouldn't want to have the head of the old man on her shoulders !
When I talked about all these things , Desdemona used to listen attentively .
Then we'll see that tomorrow night .
Well then , good bye , my lord .
Duke , please go ahead with your state business .
I'd swear to you on my soul that she's a good , honest person , sir .
That's a nasty garter belt .
I'm very sorry you're not feeling well .
Don't let the Danish king's bed be a nest of incest .
Alexas !
Horatio says we're imagining it , and won't let himself believe anything about this horrible thing that we've seen twice now .
It's an outstanding army and highly motivated .
Honestly , no .
That's true .
There he is !
Make peace with God , for you must die , my lord .
Come , uncle Exeter , enter Harfleur .
I have a favor to ask .
If that's not enough , I'll sign a contract to pay ten times that much , and I'll give you my hands , my head , and my heart as security .
I went to many places where I heard news about her , but I couldn't find her .
Am I Dromio ?
Do you think fiery fever can be put out by the windy puff of titles ?
Ride to Salisbury .
There must be some resolution .
Come with me , and let's smother my fiendish son , who smothered your two sweet sons , in bitter words .
Why do we party until we're like animals ?
I'll die You're of royal blood , and we obey you .
You seem to think no one outside of your bedroom knows what you wish .
Wasn't it just yesterday that we spoke to each other ?
Quiet , there !
Does anyone here know who I am ?
Only describing what you have ruined .
Call Cleopatra what the Romans call her .
Young gentleman , you are too bold for your age .
Marry her as you should have married her cousin , and I will let my revenge die .
No , first let's talk to him .
Tell your master there is no sound basis for his worries .
Oh heaven , oh earth , witness what I'm about to say , and reward me if I tell the truth !
Thank you kindly .
Killing him once is not enough revenge .
What you say is true .
I'll go see my mother soon .
The generals want to speak with us .
What do you get to drink , instead of sweet obedience , but poisonous flattery ?
What , you mean my face looks like a crab-apple ?
We are used to winning by standing on the earth and fighting toe to toe .
Who am I , sir ?
Why are you crying ?
Pay a surgeon to stand by and bind his wounds , Shylock , so he doesn't bleed to death .
Half of your wealth goes to Antonio .
He's afraid to come in .
No , Antony .
So , she's in on this too !
What if she won't kiss me ?
Are you talking about young Master Launcelot ?
What an irreplaceable and grievous loss !
The foulest fate would be most appropriate for me now in this latest phase of my life .
I won't be kind to you .
Oh , really ?
Thanks , Guildenstern and worthy Rosencrantz .
That's you , right ?
No more than my staying here in Rome might mean to you in Egypt .
Have them come in front of the master constable .
Yes , and you dared Caesar to fight the battle at Pharsalia , where he fought against Pompey .
Didn't they pass by you ?
Master , is this Satan's mistress ?
Our men have all broken ranks .
What's the news , brave soldier ?
So , sir .
But how long will her beautiful life last ?
I used to love you .
Something there isn't a word for .
Why , dear me , Kate !
Didn't I tell you to meet me outside and bring these morons with you ?
Oh yes .
Quiet , children , quiet .
Do you want to hear it again ?
They will , Nerissa , but we'll be disguised as men .
You should tell Antonio what you hear , but don't do it suddenly , because it might upset him .
It's a shame that we eagles are caged up while the vultures are free to do whatever they please .
I say "force" because Brutus would rather I stuck sharp blades and poisoned arrows in his ears than fill them with this .
Come , help me bang on the door , master .
Yes , sir , we hope so .
Now , on my life , the young child must be headed to the Tower to greet the young princes , whom she adores .
Yes , and it seemed twice as long to me , having been kept from your bed that whole time .
It was a color he never did like .
No .
Come , Kate , let's go to bed .
That's right .
Have his daughters made him crazy like this ? , Couldn't you have kept something for yourself ?
My royal kinsman , are you teaching our princess English ?
Here are my keys. , But why should I go ?
Look , here come two noble animals , a man and a lion .
Do you mean the king ?
Tranio , I saw her coral-pink lips move and perfume the air with her breath .
I should be ridiculed if I were offended so easily , and laughed at even more for speaking of you disrespectfully , when I had no reason to speak of you at all .
This speech is going on too long .
But if you have sex with her before the marriage ceremony takes place , the heavens will not bless your relationship , but will overwhelm you with hate , contempt , and discord , and will poison your marriage bed so that you both grow to loathe it .
Don't be scared .
Yes , of course .
But she's got to die , or she'll cheat on other men .
No , someone has to give her away or the marriage isn't legal .
Nobody but the fool , who's trying to soothe the wounds in the king's heart with jokes .
Let him go , Gertrude .
So go .
Sir , please , don't be angry .
Why have you gotten so rude ?
Good Mr. Mustardseed , I know you very well .
Let it stay in your inventory until it bankrupts you .
Mine wasn't wearing a bridle .
Come , gentlemen , let's discuss tomorrow's action in my tent .
Where's your father ?
No , my good knight .
All I have to do is remove it .
Wrong , evil traitor .
Did you kill him , then ?
May the tongues of our critics rot !
I'm too young to remember anything like it .
Nothing , my lord , or if I did , I don't know what .
I swear that gown's for me .
As freely , son , as God gave her to me .
Don't let us talk you into anything , but consider carefully the value of our offers .
Oh !
Anyone who wants to separate us will have to smoke us out of the cave of our togetherness like foxes .
Don't drive me crazy with curiosity , but tell me why your church-buried bones have burst out of their coffin , and why your tomb ,
Merciful powers , keep away the nightmares that plague me when I rest !
I wish she were in love with me instead .
Shut up , fool !
It was about to say something when the rooster crowed .
And you saw how the beggar ran from the mutt ?
What's going on , daughter ?
His father was Philip of Macedon , as I remember .
Draw your sword , you jerk !
It's been my bad luck to remain alive long enough to be able to tell the sad stories of my own misfortunes .
Where's the Master , Boatswain ?
Faint , fall down , if you don't , then you're lying about my eyes being murderers .
I met Venus as she was with her son on her way to her home on Paphos , in a carriage pulled by doves .
I didn't think I would ever fight Pompey .
Go !
Loss upon loss !
Is there anything else you wish ?
So go and put your stamp on the girl .
You killed this king , didn't you ?
Faster , Eros , faster .
You look happier already , and I'll be back quickly .
If you like , Brakenbury , you can listen to anything we say .
In heaven .
Are you talking about the crown ?
But , uncle , you know how to bear with him .
With that , I'll be off .
If it were nothing , you wouldn't need to hide it .
I have more reason to be distressed .
I will , sir .
Silence !
You refused me both .
Well , the point is , he's lost a ship .
What a poor , gullible monster. , That was a nice big gulp , monster !
I saw her face as she walked with her brother and Mark Antony .
Once I'm there , I won't need a guide anymore .
Look , Lucius , here's the book I was searching for .
Not a chance !
You are a rude , ragged nurse and an old , sullen playmate for such tender princes .
You can't take anything from me that I care less about , except my life , except my life , except my life .
It's a green-eyed monster that makes fun of the victims it devours .
I'll drink as much as you do !
Your brother's right-hand man .
I haven't seen you since you sent me to the Centaur with the gold you gave me .
Let me refer to a proverb that may help you forgive these lovers : if you can't change something , don't cry about it .
How short am I ?
May they relieve a sick old man's suffering .
Her eyes are like April : full of showers .
Everyone there got a little crazy and pulled some desperate stunts .
But for one reason they refused to execute her .
It is , my lord .
Look , sir , here it comes !
Then I will kiss your lips , Kate .
The enemy's losses have been very great , pretty substantial .
And I'm telling you it was burnt and dried out .
I have to stop you , Cimber .
Get up early tomorrow , at the sound of the lark , noble Norfolk .
And don't say all of that yet .
That's true , my good boy. , Come on , take us to that hut .
You know I gave it to you just now .
Who will thank us now ?
Go on , get out of here .
Take whatever wife you want to bed with you , You'll have a fool's head forever .
Well , your imprisonment won't last long .
That's all I wanted to know .
That's what I hear .
I do believe your Majesty takes no shame in wearing the leek on Saint Davy's Day .
Our bodies are like gardens and our willpower is like the gardener .
Don't make me do it , my lady .
I just meant that you should use some holy thistle .
Go after her , go .
If I know my own thoughts and desires , and I'm not dreaming or crazy , which I'm sure I'm not , then , dear uncle , I've never had so much as a half-formed thought that would have offended you .
He saved me the trouble : here he comes .
It's lovely to see you .
Yes , my lord .
Come , bring me to them .
I don't
He lay there , stretched out like a wounded knight .
If you can think of a more awful title , I'll call her that .
We're two lions born on the same day in the same litter , and I'm the older and more terrible .
By his dress I can tell he's my countryman , but I don't recognize him .
Not me .
Get out of here , you horrible ghost , you hallucination .
Be invisible to everyone except yourself and me .
My lord , your promise of the earldom , Richmond !
I often wander around in the woods like a forest ranger until the sun rises in the fiery red sky over the ocean , turning the salty green water to gold .
Give me your hand .
On one and the same trip Claribel found a husband in Tunis , and Ferdinand , her brother , found a wife where he was shipwrecked ; Prospero found his dukedom on a poor island ; and all of us found ourselves when we lost control of ourselves .
But first , I have to tell you that Desdemona's completely in love with him .
The one who chooses me will get what he deserves" !
You annoying idiot , what Epidamnum ship is waiting for me ?
He thinks that since his fortune is twenty times better than yours , it would be like pitting twenty men against one .
We can't wait here .
Have you forgotten who I am ?
Othello's wife has a lot of influence now .
I charge you , in the name of God , be careful what you say .
It is that .
I found Orlando under a tree , like a dropped acorn .
There is nothing in the world that I love as much as you .
Would he have snuck away from me while I was asleep ?
There have never been orphans who've suffered what we have .
To see an elderly , unlucky merchant from Syracuse publicly beheaded for breaking the law and coming here to Ephesus .
If you tickle us , don't we laugh ?
But two men complimenting each other is like two baboons getting together .
Where is his body , Messala ?
Is it possible ?
Tell Antony that Brutus has been taken .
How are you , Lorenzo ?
As for myself , I didn't dare laugh , for fear of opening my lips and inhaling the stinking air .
Today was the day I breathed my first breath .
There's meaning in your snoring .
Here's Decius Brutus .
Poor Tom's chilly .
Show your slaves how mad you are , and make your servants tremble .
He's dead .
I'll speak to them , and then tonight I'll get them all so drunk that the wine seeps out of their old war wounds .
Here and now I seem like Antony , but I can't keep myself in this form , my boy .
Let's not argue here in front of both our armies , which ought to see nothing but love between us .
Being satisfied with a job well done is payment enough .
The sun will not appear today .
You purple flower , hit by Cupid's arrow , sink into the pupils of this man's eyes .
I do .
Why , the he that will marry this woman .
And when I get my reward , I'll get out of here .
I will not trade my horse for any that walks on four legs .
But , go on .
Because their business lies outside the home .
Who are you ?
We'll see our husbands before they even have a chance to miss us .
Passionate" ?
I recognize the handwriting .
I have the motivation , the willpower , the ability , and the means to do it .
I was ordered not to .
Your children caused you trouble in your youth , but mine will bring you comfort in your old age .
That's the one .
With his own lightning bolts ; I've shaken up the sturdy cliffs and uprooted pines and cedars ; I've opened up graves and awakened the corpses sleeping in them , letting them out with my powerful magic .
No , he's a devil , a devil , I tell you !
He received Caesar's letters , and he is coming .
I should have reprimanded you then for not bringing it , but you started fighting with me first .
I could imagine he's divine , since I never saw anything so noble-looking on earth before .
Shall we go watch this wrestling , cousin ?
As long as hell and Richard want it .
I wonder why Cambio hasn't shown up in all this time .
I'm not a man who talks a lot , but I thank you .
But he says he still loves and respects you , and based on his own feelings alone he's looking for an opportunity to safely take you back .
Don't do it with poison .
If I'm telling the truth like a fool in saying all this , whip the first person who thinks I sound foolish .
These things are beyond anything we've seen before , and I'm afraid .
Let's get started right away .
I suspect that I have committed some offence to the city and you have come to reprimand me for not knowing better .
I am satisfied .
Life is a story told by an idiot , full of noise and emotional disturbance but devoid of meaning .
We're waiting here for you .
Oh no , sir , I won't let him go , sir , not without a good reason .
Women are sex machines below the waist , though they're chaste up above .
Look , here he comes .
I beg you to pay a visit right away to my son , who's changed too much .
I would die of pity to see someone else in my condition .
I'm glad to see you in such a merry mood .
Didn't you just say he was ?
Pray God your wife doesn't send you a worse one .
Do you think I would live a life of jealousy , tormented by new suspicions every hour ?
I don't think he wants to be anywhere but where he is .
My lord , I'll do it right away .
It's time we hit the road .
It's nine o'clock .
Now , I swear by Apollo, By Apollo , King , you're taking the names of the gods in vain .
Farewell , hostess .
Now , Baptista , let's turn to your younger daughter .
Good-bye to you , the last of all the Romans .
Oh , I'd kill that bastard Cassio forty thousand times if I could !
Macbeth .
Cleopatra , How could I have ever thought that you would be faithful and true , even though your vows of love shook the heavens themselves , you , who were unfaithful to Fulvia ?
Sweet Hero ; when I imagine you now , you seem as beautiful as you did when I first loved you .
Cheer up , good Adam .
And you , sir , what's Well , compared to a fine workman , you might call me a mere cobbler .
You're mistaken .
Are you laughing at what I say , as if I were a fool ?
But oh , poor Glou-cester !
From there we'll safely carry you to France and back , calming the waters of the Channel to provide you with a smooth voyage .
Thoughts work so quickly that even now you can imagine him on Blackheath , where his lords suggest that he should carry his battle-scarred sword and helmet on a procession through the city .
I'm going to England .
Where was she born ?
You're looking for Lord Hamlet .
Now , lords , don't let slip any opportunity that might be advantageous for our expedition .
Farewell till then .
Show me the caskets and let me try my luck .
Oh , horror , horror , horror !
Servants , take these gentlemen to see Hamlet .
Go ahead , Moon .
Or it's bottomless , at least : pour affection in one end , and it runs out the other .
And yet she cheapens herself by turning her gaze on me , who cut her sweet prince's life short and made her a widow ?
You notorious whore !
And like I am for no woman .
In prison we'll outlast hordes of rulers that will come and go as their fortunes change .
Here are the rulers of France and Burgundy , my lord .
If we're all pork-eaters , we won't be able to get our hands on a slice of bacon , even if we've got the money for it .
Good grief , do you think that just because I'm dressed like a man , I have a man's patience ?
Good gentlemen , give me permission to speak .
Sir , sir , sir ,
What is it , my dear Bianca ?
Be convincing .
That'll be fine .
How did you get better ?
Yes , with Cassio .
What do you have to say to me ?
But people often screw things up trying to make them better .
That's the whore's curse , to seduce many men , but to be seduced by one .
What in the world made you risk your reputation like this and become a street brawler ?
If we have sweet-smelling breath , I'm sure they'll say "it's a sweet play." Now no more talking .
You can decide that privately .
Leave me alone .
My husband is often like this , and he has been since he was a child .
Is the snake better than the eel because the pattern on his back pleases the eye ?
I'll find you another horse .
Curse my father's ambition !
Destiny chooses when you'll die and who you'll marry .
Lovely Katherine , if you will love me well with your French heart , I'm happy to hear you confess it in broken English .
They steal hearts .
Lock him in , so he can play the fool in his own home only .
See how well she can turn ?
We'll keep the lines of communication open between us .
But I never spoke the whole time ?
Depending on what we plant , weeds or lettuce , or one kind of herb rather than a variety , the garden will either be barren and useless , or rich and productive .
All this conversing has turned men into tongues , and fancy ones , at that .
You're poisoning my eyes .
Oh , you evil woman !
But if you see a wheel going uphill , latch on for the ride .
Still , did you notice how ready he was to hire good tutors for her ?
Very near , and approaching fast .
Clouds , dissolve into rain , so that I could say the gods themselves are weeping !
As far as I'm concerned , what's past is done .
Have you forgotten her ?
Halt !
Goodbye then , Hero .
Since nobody knows anything about what he leaves behind , then what does it mean to leave early ?
You wrong me , Brutus .
I don't want to go mad .
When a woman is virtuous , talents like these just make her better .
And anything else ?
I wouldn't stay here tonight for the entire town .
Cassio , my lord ?
According to an agreement , I should wear it myself .
Many thanks , Signior Gremio .
I , fight against you , Antony ?
Your death would prevent that .
Thank you .
I'm telling you , get out of here , and don't follow me around like this .
They grow like savages , like soldiers who meditate on nothing but blood , surrounded by swearing and stern looks , ragged clothing and everything unnatural .
You can't mean what you're saying .
Antonio , as I heard in Genoa , What , what , what ?
Good point , and well said .
Let the rain spray !
Don't come near till you hear me call you .
I didn't do anything wrong that I know of , unless it was a sin to defend myself when someone attacked me .
Well , take him on up and we'll try to pull it off .
She'll have to have it .
I'll be off before you are .
Bardolph , be happy. , Nym , rouse your bragging spirits. , Boy , be brave .
He ran out that way , sir , when he couldn't , Follow him , now !
In these less dainty times , you're not breaking the laws of sanctuary to seize him .
Oh , gods , make me worthy of this noble wife !
And you called the fairy creature harmless , monster .
I sense you're treating me like a child .
Let me have your attention for a moment .
I'll lie down here and measure out my grave .
If it turns out he wasn't , certain people are going to get it .
Have your wife attend to her , and bring them along as soon as you can .
But if he's resistant and chilly , then be like that too and break off the conversation .
The servants , the duke , and your daughter all seem to be treating you less kindly .
Good duke , come receive your daughter .
Then tomorrow we'll find that they feel only like eating , not like fighting .
So please rest .
Look for him , Titinius , while I go to meet the noble Brutus and force him to hear this news .
Oh , a thousand of them , all of which I've forgotten .
Our handwriting gives away our hearts .
I'll be back quicker than you can think a thought .
Neighbors and friends , though we don't have anyone for the bride and bridegroom's places at the table , you know there's nothing missing in the feast itself .
I regret my crime more than my death , and I beg your Highness to forgive me , while punishing my body with death .
My lord , your noble subjects are looking for you all over the camp .
Like the wind , I must have the freedom to blast anyone I please , as fools do .
If you take more or less than exactly a pound , even if it's just the tiniest fraction of an ounce , if the scale changes by even so much as a hair , you die , and all your property will be confiscated .
My countrymen , Silence !
Bring him to me in silence .
Consider how young you are , and question your feelings .
Are you afraid to act the way you desire ?
Maybe it's an English tailor who liked to skimp on the fabric for people's clothes .
So you'll be hanged at the state's expense .
This bad weather isn't good to walk around in .
Should we go find Benedick and tell him about Beatrice's love ?
What news do you have ?
Adieu .
God bless your Grace !
His ships are maneuverable .
I'll go join him there , going down deeper than any anchor ever sank , and lie with him dead in the mud .
Oh , oh , Edmund , I don't like this monstrous business .
Have I lost my wit ?
Should I say to you , "Set them free !
We've seen the best our age has to offer .
That's a poor example .
Some Now listen , either give me my ring or give me the necklace .
In a way" is the right way to go .
I'm your little dog , Demetrius .
I'm a surgeon to old shoes .
The only kind of tears you should shed in this case are the kind you might get from holding an onion to your nose .
It's a pity that fools aren't allowed to speak wisely about the foolish things that wise men do .
Be free and happy .
Go , daughter .
I'll go get my sister and see what she thinks .
Then turn your noble face away from me , that face that the whole world adores .
Speak , man , what's the matter ?
No one may be bolder than my Lord Hastings .
He is taking care of it as we speak .
Oh , this is treachery !
Fire !
I'll come soon .
On my honor , I swear I love Rivers with all my heart .
Read the time there .
Isn't that him heading this way ?
Sit down , Clitus .
Stop , sir , for God's sake !
It's a trick to confuse us .
Monster sweetie , be a good monster and just speak once .
Well , it must have been Signior Benedick .
His words are like poison to me .
The wind is filling your ship's sail , and they're waiting for you .
No , he loves and cherishes me .
Well then , I'll do it .
You're snoring , but it sounds like you're talking .
You'll find Beatrice there , talking to Claudio and the Prince .
Would your highness like to take a walk ?
I did .
What dangers are you trying to lead me into , Cassius , that you want me to look inside myself for something that's not there ?
I'm going , I'm going .
The Emperor is calling for Canidius .
His daughter and I will be king and queen , God protect us ! , and you and Trinculo will be our governors. , Do you like that idea , Trinculo ?
Don't believe any of us .
And hello to you , fair sister .
My lord , how are you feeling ?
How will we pass the time without some entertainment ?
Ran off with a Christian !
Yes , my lord , quite well .
And because you interrupt us so that we can't dance for them , the winds have made fogs rise up out of the sea and fall down on the rivers so that the rivers flood , just to get revenge on you .
No , sir , she's human .
The fractured world , in its confusion , should send lions into the city streets and humans into the wilderness to live in lions' dens .
Follow them , please .
He's offered me a lot of affection lately .
He's eager to see your head .
Get up , I tell you !
No , Octavius Caesar , we'll respond to their charge .
He's at home , my lord .
Whip me , you devils , so I don't have to look at this heavenly sight !
If you refuse , let an eternal curse fall on you .
So give me my nightgown , Emilia , and I'll say goodnight .
No , I am a Welshman .
What's up , my man ?
You told me you hated him .
I might do something I'll be sorry for .
Your cheeks are too flushed for me to believe that was a fake faint .
Why , the man who shortens his life by twenty years cuts off twenty years of worrying about death .
He speaks well .
Why should I be afraid of your judgment when I haven't done anything wrong ?
Thank you .
You call this a scale ?
He has one ship bound for Tripoli , another heading for the Indies .
Once again , what's the news ?
Oh , please do .
I'll fight at sea .
Yes , he did .
But if you have the stomach for it , you'll have all the help from me you need .
Oh you damned villain !
So beware of my contempt , and keep your promise .
Now , Brutus , you have only yourself to thank .
Doors , open up for whoever is knocking !
If people take what he says , fine .
Good monster !
Military music and military rites will speak for his heroic qualities .
Yes , let's go to sleep .
This is unbelievable !
Pardon me , lords and gentlemen who stayed awake .
The crows flying down below look as small as ants .
On me , though I am limping and deformed ?
Come , I'll show you your bridal chamber .
Farewell , sir .
Why do you look like that ?
This used to be a great puzzle , but now I've solved it .
Her reputation is also her own .
Freedom !
Is there such a place ?
Such exercise !
I can't make myself a man by wishing I were , so as a woman I'll die , from grieving .
Go forward .
You couldn't see him , but I could .
Good morning to you .
He who chooses me will get what he deserves." I'll assume I deserve the very best. , Give me a key for this one .
These sweet thoughts relieve me and refresh me , especially when I'm slaving away busily .
I don't have the cash right now .
No one ever gave a prayer like that before going to sleep .
My lord , you used to like me .
That's a good song .
Pity the hand that shed this valuable blood .
Oh , Fate , come and cut the thread of my life .
Discipline must be kept .
If he will grant me conquered Egypt , so that I may give it to my son , I will kneel to him with thanks .
I beg you , turn away and cry for her .
Damn you , don't mock and sneer at me .
Bathe his filthy head with warm , scented water .
My heart is thirsty for that noble promise .
I have bankrupted three tailors .
Yes , but how he adores Mark Antony !
What a king Claudius is !
The deal is closed .
Who could have restrained himself , who loved Duncan and had the courage to act on it ?
I won't argue with her , so her beautiful body won't disarm me. , Tonight , Iago .
In a time like this , it doesn't make sense to criticize every offense .
I use it all the time , since it's all that I have .
Be careful , Signior Baptista , lest you be made the dupe in this business .
Then take this man into your service , Octavius , for he did the final service to my master .
A greater gift ?
Are your tears wet ?
Give me your hand .
Why are you chewing on your lower lip like that ?
Good Enobarbus , you would be doing a very good thing if you advised your captain to speak calmly and quietly .
Yes , I'll wipe my mind clean of all trivial facts and memories and preserve only your commandment there .
Come , come , you weak , ungovernable worms !
Listen , Hortensio .
You didn't give me any gold .
Run away , I beg you !
We'll meet again at nine in the morning .
What a storm !
If you put me in the stocks you'll insult him both as a king and as a man .
You should listen to reason .
You're my lieutenant now .
You're going to die .
What if I had a rat in my house , and I felt like paying ten thousand ducats to have it exterminated ?
What color is her hair ?
But this would be too cold a place to sleep if he hadn't warmed himself with ale .
Well , I'm the man you're speaking of .
But come on , let's see you do your dance .
No , my lord .
No , there it is again .
What are you doing , wearing your best clothes ?
I'm positively stuffed with air , I eat so much of it .
They are harder than the stones the house is made of .
You tell her , widow !
Either my eyes deceive me , or I see two husbands .
The king will be offended to find out that his messenger is so badly treated .
My Lord of Oxford , you , Sir William Brandon , and you , Sir Walter Herbert , are going to stay with me .
Let's pray that we never come into conflict like that again .
I'm glad to see you go .
I'll call for you soon .
I've never seen him like this .
You know that the style of a man's jacket or hat or coat means nothing .
Excuse me ?
I'll let you know right away how it's going .
Look , it's the Prince and Mr. Love .
Has he ever tested out these ideas on you before ?
Oh , forgive me !
Get out !
Trinculo , if you interrupt him any more , I swear I'll knock some teeth out of your head .
Good night , good night .
So , by Christ , I'll cut off your head .
Yes , he's the one who first told me about her .
Me , sir ?
We have to go out and talk to them .
God , what a burden on you I must have been !
Go pinch your cheeks and bring some color back into your face , you cowardly boy .
As dumb as dirt !
You've served me faithfully .
Well , enjoy the sweetness of deep sleep .
And should everyone who makes promises and breaks them be hanged ?
Over there , where Titinius mourns it .
Now all is for nothing .
The stuff you had at the Centaur , sir .
If you have poison for me , I'll drink it .
She already has a face .
I've brought him a present .
I hear what they say about him for doing that .
Don't take too long , unless you want our king to come after me to ask what's holding things up , because he's already landed here .
If you are a devil , I won't be able to kill you .
Though I have far more reason , I don't have as much energy to curse you .
They keep up Adam's profession .
Come , why be so hesitant ?
Now it's time to get back to my studying , since I have a lot of serious business to take care of before dinner .
Oh , how I love you !
Tell your wife to watch her .
And didn't they place the wreath of victory on my brow and order me to give it to you ?
A governor shines as brightly as a king until a king is near by , and the governor suddenly looks like a nobody .
The more you joke about it , the more clearly I feel how serious it is !
Who pleaded with me to pardon
Yes .
I'm terribly sleepy .
And like I am for Rosalind .
God forbid he wants to challenge me !
He's furious because she stole an adorable boy from an Indian king .
Sit down and eat , and welcome to our table .
He is the prince of horses .
Why did you once seem lovely to me ?
Is he married to Cleopatra ?
Who is this fool who wants all the fuss of marriage ?
What can I do for your highness ?
No , none that you're smart enough to make .
That's really the best way to win the Moor back again .
A cat in heat will look for a mate , And Rosalind certainly will too .
My honor wasn't given ; it was only dominated .
You're forgetting yourself when you back me into a corner .
If that's what you mean , I'll melt this gold and pour it down your throat that speaks these hateful words .
It's not manly to cry .
Meanwhile , thank you for your efforts .
What wicked magician has conjured up this devil to interrupt this sacred burial rite ?
You both know Banquo was your enemy .
I am their mother .
Jailer , keep an eye on him .
If I were to make a prediction regarding this union , I wouldn't say that .
I'm not insulting you .
What is it , Agrippa ?
Get me some poison tonight , Iago .
But don't take all that pain on yourself .
Friends , Romans , countrymen , give me your attention .
Give it to my wife , and get your money .
Well , I'll get my revenge .
Don't you hear me speaking ?
Good Mr. Peaseblossom , I'd like to get to know you better too. , And you , may I ask what your name is , sir ?
He doesn't miss a thing .
Your eldest daughters destroyed themselves and died in despair .
I know who you are .
And your lies caused this murder .
No medicine in the world can cure you .
To celebrate a marriage of true love , and give a gift to the lovers .
I'll get you for that .
The guilty speak volumes even when they're silent .
Let's proceed to the field .
Damn you !
I don't think he wants to be disturbed .
Yes , you're right .
Poor man !
I wish my eyes were
Kent , if you want to stay alive , stop talking .
God be with you .
The devil's advice is nicer .
I've noticed it myself .
He must be wearing this crazy outfit for some reason .
How handsome it is .
He's subhuman , like an animal .
Then let Octavia dig up your face with her nails .
Now , sir , where is Claudio ?
They
If you regard it as shameful , put the shame on me .
I promise I will .
I know they do , and I certainly deserve it .
If you see anything else , let me know .
Let's have him land and solemnly proceed to London .
And your experience makes you sad .
No !
Me too , lieutenant .
The privilege of never seeing me again .
Oh , father , I'm taking care of your business .
Let's follow him .
Come on , put it away .
Have more than you show , Speak less than you know , Lend less than you owe .
Let the gods judge me !
Just let me say one prayer !
I never saw my father in my life .
Whatever kind you want , I guess .
For Hecuba !
These outbursts of yours don't even look like real fear .
And then what would I do with him ?
Let's go !
Thanks , you brave men who defend this island and respect Othello .
Well , learn to make jokes at the appropriate time .
I love my master , and he'll find me very hard-working .
If I could colonize this island , my lord , He'd cultivate weeds on it .
You wouldn't know enough to be afraid of traps .
Come on , you turtle !
Now you sound like a man .
You're a king's advisor .
That's the truth .
What was the last cry for ?
That's enough , Dromio , please .
Goneril with a white beard ?
Come , come , you are too clever for your own good .
Give me one , " I said .
Say , "That splendid Antony." The courageous Caesar !
Oh , I suffered along with all the men I watched suffer !
Does that mean he's lazy ?
I'm afraid something dangerous is coming toward you .
Now that I'm done , Wall can go away .
Why ?
In fact , the real nightmare had only just begun .
Have you heard about Albany's and Cornwall's troops ?
Tell us how it happened , noble Casca .
He certainly is .
She has disarmed me .
Then you'll be able to cheer If he were dead , what would happen to me ?
You're right , I'll go quietly .
You've come to face a ruthless enemy , an inhuman wretch incapable of pity , without any feelings of mercy .
I hope he's not anywhere so disreputable that thugs like you can find him .
I can assure you that no enemy will ever take the noble Brutus alive .
Who are the people who want to speak with me ?
Ariel , you've done your work exactly as I ordered .
Quiet !
The ground is brown .
Please leave it to me to take care of the burial , as I have more reason to mourn than you do .
I know I won't please you .
Curse you all , you're all murderers and traitors !
Until then , we've said enough .
And also to find out the size of the enemy army .
And so farewell .
I think few die well who die in battle .
He has come to kill my heart .
May the god of power make me , the weakest of the weak , your mediator .
I mean , what sort of man is he ?
We'll be your witnesses .
What do you mean , my lord ?
Your grief should not be equal to his worth , because then your sorrow would never end .
Friends , go your separate ways .
Let's go .
But I'm ashamed to kiss , sir .
No , Pompey , I haven't had anything to drink .
I'm ready to hear you .
But was this near the shore ?
Let heaven and men and devils tell me to shut me up .
There !
My father instructed you in his will to give me a good education .
He has both my power and my influence over Octavia .
Here , stand behind this wall ; he'll come right away .
Look , here are the boxes , prince .
Honestly , she is too ill-tempered .
He tried to kill me recently , very recently .
And I'm going to sleep .
No doubt , for you wear too many in the first place , and it might be more seemly to make do with fewer .
What man is that ?
These are ugly antics .
He is indeed worthy of the name "horse , " and you can call all the rest beasts .
Lysander , where are you going with all this ?
No , you're just taunting me .
If my lips had the power to give life , I would wear them out like this .
Horny animals !
You know , uncle , A sparrow once raised a cuckoo in its nest Until the cuckoo grew up and bit the sparrow's head off .
There's still a spot here .
Should we just get down to it ?
Well , let's have it , Grumio .
An annoying schoolboy , unworthy of such an honor , joined by a masquerader and a partier !
I'll give you more instructions later .
No , I swear , I don't even know what's in it .
She's not feeling well .
I did .
Gower is a good captain , and is well versed and well read in the wars .
Have you heard about anything unusual happening in the city ?
And last night at dinner , you got up abruptly and paced back and forth with your arms crossed , brooding and sighing , and when I asked you what was the matter , you gave me a dirty look .
Listen !
Speak once again .
There's more to this ring than its cash value .
Please , tell me more .
Stay where you are .
Listen to what the tyrant says .
But then again he's never really understood his own feelings very well .
What things , my lord ?
Well , the tree bears rotten fruit .
I'll see her like this .
I've written to my sister telling her everything he's said .
It's true I'm not married , Caesar .
I can't get that song out of my head tonight .
Yes .
In that case , he's more obliged to you than I am .
Goodbye to the horses and the trumpets and the drums , the flute and the splendid banners , and all those proud displays and pageantry of war !
What , have you forgotten me ?
Because , if you must know , she's been chosen by Signior Gremio .
One last thing , and this is up to you .
That's the way it should be , only Antony should conquer Antony .
Didn't I deserve anything more than a fool's head ?
Write to me very soon and I'll let you know what she thinks .
He will live as a cursed man .
My husband will save me .
That's where I'm going now , so I'll leave you here .
Why are you looking at me so strangely ?
Under Captain Gower , my liege .
That's true , they are .
If she lives a long and happy life , then all women may as well turn into monsters .
Burn !
Where are you , Death ?
Your bedroom .
Or else their guardians and advisors said no , What hell , to have your love life determined by someone else !
In short , when I told him how firmly opposed I was to his hideous plan , he pulled out his sword and lunged at my defenseless body , cutting my arm .
Give me a hand and help me off with this magic cloak .
Are you educated ?
It's unbelievable .
I showed it to you once .
Believe that you are a foolish little baby for believing these "offers" are something real .
With this I avoid the grief of Antony's death .
That really would be kind .
Enough to buy everything you have declared .
Since you're old and respected , you should be wise .
He ran to his house , stunned .
Is it possible that any crime could be so valuable ?
Please don't be offended that I don't want to offend you any more .
Even if I have to die , as they threaten , I have to help the king .
Good-bye , son .
Like her ?
Madam , I heard her speak .
He thanks you on his knees many times and considers himself fortunate to have fallen into the hands of one , as he thinks , who is the bravest , most valorous , and thrice-worthy gentleman of England .
I want to avoid that .
If he fears God , he must necessarily keep the peace .
As good a wife as she is , that's how good a husband I am to you .
These vows are just traps for stupid birds .
Brave Iago , how honest and trustworthy you are !
If he's not around , bring his brother Oliver to me .
dusk and all night long sleeps in peace .
If you ever loved your poor dear father , Oh God !
Besides , his cottage , his flocks , and his grazing rights are on sale now , and since he's not there , there's nothing to eat at our house .
My cousin Westmoreland ?
Thank you .
Cram your good news into my ears .
Among the ten thousand the French have lost only sixteen hundred are mercenaries .
Here comes the herald of the French , my liege .
I'd rather die in a ditch in Egypt , and make it my gentle grave .
Did the brothers-in-law leave ?
I have no doubt about that , since I know there isn't a man among us who isn't with me wholeheartedly , or a soul left behind who doesn't wish us success and conquest .
We don't intend any harm to you , nor to anyone else .
Do you need something ?
You and I have heard our fathers talk of another Brutus , your ancestor , who would've let the devil himself reign in his Roman Republic before he let a king rule .
Yes , your Majesty .
So be careful .
Now let me see if I can translate it .
Mighty duke , please allow me to say something .
Treat Desdemona well .
Please allow her to do this .
They're in the heat of passion ; they simply have to be together .
Stand back , boy .
Go ahead .
And as you know , his connections , if he put them to good use , might be enough to hurt us all .
And women .
Gentlemen , on to the bridal dinner .
Here , madam : Translate .
I'll get her , but I won't keep her long .
Come on , kill me and brag about it !
I'd rather carry a reed that obviously can't protect me than a sword I can not lift .
How dare you tell us about God's laws when you have broken them so savagely yourself ?
Leap and dance for him .
No-the law goes further : if anyone born in Ephesus is seen in Syracuse's marketplaces or if anyone born in Syracuse comes to Ephesus , that man dies , and his possessions will be confiscated by the Duke , unless he can raise a thousand marks to pay the penalty and ransom himself .
But to tell you the truth , reason and love have very little to do with each other these days .
I'm coming , I'm coming !
Wish I could say the same .
So , the man would talk half as much as Benedick and be half as serious as Don John , And if he were handsome , agile , and rich , too , he could have any woman in the world , all he'd need was her good will .
Are you really as in love as your poems declare ?
Now get out of here !
He rests tonight within twenty-one miles of Rome .
I'll recognize him all right , I'm sure of it .
The hell with order !
And what do you know , boy ?
I don't like his face .
Clarence is still alive ; Edward is not only alive , he's king .
I know you well .
Are you insane , old man ?
And find a poverty stricken gentleman who I can marry straightaway to Clarence's daughter .
It's nothing .
Enough of your magic spells , you hateful , withered hag .
But they aren't .
Cruel , cruel news !
No one passing by ?
Tell her that I've been arrested and the money will be my bail .
Please come with me .
All of them ?
My lord , your son has paid the soldier's price : death .
Yes , right now .
Let me see Philostrate .
Fair princess , you've missed some good sport .
I will , Caesar .
She speaks my language !
May God , who is the best matchmaker , join your hearts and realms in one .
It was yours , I swear .
If you get nasty with me , Pistol , I'll stab you with my sword , in fair play .
My mistress Titania is in love with a monster .
It was just two days ago that I tripped you and beat you up in front of the king .
Othello ?
Oh , my good lord , don't make me insult music again with my awful singing .
Are you done yet ?
Get him , he's a thief !
Isn't their ingratitude like the mouth biting the hand that feeds it ?
Caesar , you are revenged with the very same sword that killed you .
Very sad .
Tell me .
With the quick , intelligent wit she's rumored to have , she can't really be such a bad judge of character that she'd refuse a man as exceptional as Signior Benedick .
No , you won't die yourself , but only by proxy .
My mistress here lies murdered in her bed , No , heaven forbid !
You inhuman dog !
It's revolting !
Now I'm Dromio and no longer attached to him .
Delighted to hear you ask so nicely , but I won't stay in any case .
Let's not leave him out .
Look , she's spotted him with those sweet eyes of hers .
No , don't pause , because I
Quiet , quiet , Iras .
Edward's sons have been carried off by the angels and Anne , my wife , has bid good night to the world .
Call up your courage .
That will kill our lovers .
Tell us about this wrestling .
Was the Duke of Milan kicked out of Milan so his children could become kings of Naples ?
Oh , he was gentle , mild , and virtuous .
You've been competing with this king for my daughter .
What do you remember ?
This place is full of trouble , torments , and amazements .
I beg you to let me go .
Yes , we get the idea .
And I came with him .
Poor lady , she'll go crazy when she sees it's missing .
Why has all this been put on the table ?
You've killed an innocent woman , and you're going to pay dearly for her death .
Don't believe in this .
The more I suffer , the more spiteful he becomes .
I'll limp after you .
Did you say Caesar fainted ?
Fight ?
Let me go with you .
She's gone forever .
Why are you so rude to someone who loves you so much ?
Bring me this plant , and get back here before the sea monster has time to swim three miles .
Be as lazy and neglectful as you like around him , you and the other servants .
Our leader is being led .
Good morning , neighbor Gremio .
Say goodbye to me .
Good night then , Casca .
Good to see you , Iago .
So , what hour of comfort have I ever had in your company ?
Do you see that cloud up there that looks like a camel ?
You can't trust all the rumors .
That's what I intend to do too .
Oh well .
Carry them away .
Very humid , I can't tell you how humid it is .
Most noble brother , you have done me wrong .
I'd be just as happy if you broke his neck as his finger .
It means being full of sighs and tears , like I am for Phoebe .
Oh , God help me !
Let's go greet him when he lands .
God forbid that I snatch the crown from him .
Again !
No , don't press up against me .
Although I can't make his ship disappear , I can still make his journey miserable .
How did he say good-bye ?
It's the smartest partition I've ever heard speak , my lord .
That's not in her favor .
Of course , they won't believe you without proof .
Lovely , most lovely Katherine , will you agree to teach a soldier the words that would recommend his love-suit to a gentle heart like yours ?
Yes , as much as you look like yourself .
You would be committing a wicked sin by chiding other people for sinning , because you yourself have been a terrible sinner , as carnal in your appetites as lust itself , and all the swollen pustules of sin that you acquired in your freedom you now want to burst and shoot back into the world at large .
Where does he sleep ?
I swear that nothing anyone can say will change my mind .
I have neither cleverness nor rhetorical skill nor the authority nor gesture nor eloquence nor the power of speech to stir men up .
He is a noble prisoner !
My father wasn't a traitor .
I'll wear a big sword in my belt , carry a boar-spear in my hand , and hide all my womanish fear in my heart .
I assure you , sir , there's nothing to be afraid of .
And there's a messenger representing a fifth one , the prince of Morocco , who says the prince will be here tonight .
Trinculo , speak politely .
I can hear the lark singing .
Is he there in person ?
Sir , he left his belongings and treasure .
They are his dung , and he their beetle .
Her name is Portia .
He's like a huge wheel on the top of the highest mountain whose spokes touch the rim of ten thousand smaller things , when it falls down the mountain , every little object goes down with it .
If a Jew offends a Christian , what's the Christian's kind and gentle reaction ?
Here are the keys , and there is the duke , sleeping .
If you hadn't shown up on cue , my lord , Lord Hastings was going to take your part , I mean , he was going to speak for you , in the crowning of the king .
I saw Bassanio and Antonio say goodbye .
And go away , witch , go away .
As long as it's honorable , you can be sure that I'll let you use all my money and do everything I can to help you .
But sir , he's crazy .
Now please go in .
When I freed you from slavery , didn't you swear to do this when I asked you ?
Maybe it'll come again .
You abused me to my face .
I could cure you , if you just called me Rosalind and came by my cottage every day to woo me .
I don't have a talent for putting my heart's feelings into words .
Can you ask around and find out ?
No , who are you talking about ?
Alas , I am the mother of all these others ' griefs .
Which he quickly allowed , given that you're an obstacle to his lust .
But what can be done to prevent it ?
And did you see the handkerchief ?
Your words are idiotic .
You're a poor man if you're this impatient !
Like a fire that gets covered up , Benedick should smother his love and waste away .
When he's there next time , I'll send my daughter to see him .
She'd laugh me right out of my body and kill me with her wit .
Be angry whenever you like , it's all right with me .
You're standing .
Don't bother us up here .
One of them is too much like a painting of a man , he never speaks , and the other is too much like a spoiled little boy , always chattering .
Alas , I hate myself instead , because of the hateful deeds I've committed .
Yes , she did tell us .
Poison never landed on such an ugly toad .
They wouldn't say anything ?
You will be whipped .
You're not in love either ?
Heaven help her ! , Get him out of here for now .
I've got the whole barrel , man .
Alas , she has been too long exiled from France , whose crops all lie in heaps , rotting with ripeness .
May your sword be victorious and everything you do succeed .
It took me two years before I had a single tooth .
The king has been informed of all their plans , but they have no idea .
Now I see it's true .
I spoke with a Frenchman yesterday who said that a Venetian ship loaded with treasure was wrecked in the English Channel .
I was telling you he used witchcraft to take this island .
What men have you lost , Fluellen ?
But you don't look as if you bring good news .
We're trying to be reasonable while you're so upset , and we understand that you're old , and, But Goneril knows what she's doing .
By the door .
You , my slave , were her servant at the time , as you admit yourself .
When storms arrive early , you can expect the harvest will be damaged .
Please , will you take his arm ?
It stands by her bedside .
Come here .
I only need to show your sword to Caesar and tell him about your death to get into his good favor .
We come here to help you and you treat us like thugs , but you let an African horse climb all over your daughter .
I'll meet you at your tent .
Bring me face to face with Macbeth , that devil of Scotland .
Bring us the letters .
Put
Murder and treason !
Music feeds the melancholy moods of us lovers .
Lady Beatrice , have you been crying this entire time ?
Well , I'm not beautiful , so I hope that I can at least be chaste .
Anyway , I have to say goodbye to you now .
Captain Fluellen !
I swear on my life that I'm speaking the truth .
If the duke and his court agree to set aside the fine for one half of his property , I'm happy , as long as he lets me have the other half in trust , to give it to the gentleman who recently stole his daughter .
I bet it will .
Nothing , my lord .
That will happen before sunset .
Wasn't that Cassio leaving my wife ?
Me too , Lord !
Thankfully , we have reason to cool our raging lusts .
Why are they shouting ?
The king , his brother , and your brother are all waiting there in a crazed state of mind , and the rest are grieving over them , sad and astonished .
The gods know how dearly Caesar loved him !
Whatever pertains to myself I will deal with last .
Everything that belongs to them is yours .
You can't judge me based on what I do tonight .
I see you like to make big offers , sir .
Oh , I wish I could know what will happen today before it happens !
Enough , cousin .
The day is well on its way .
Listen Tranio !
Oh , the world never saw a sweeter creature .
I have an adventurous fairy who'll go seek out the squirrel's secret stash and get you some fresh nuts .
You're stripped of your power and your command , and Cassio will govern Cyprus .
She will not come .
My wife was killed too ?
He never did harm that I heard of .
Her name is Katherina Minola , famous throughout Padua for her scolding tongue .
Please have a seat .
Yes indeed .
I'll do so .
Absolutely , so long as he gets the girl .
Was a man ever so tired ?
Everyone who can hear has heard about it .
Oh , sweet England !
It's nine o'clock !
Smile , then , on this beautiful union .
Me , a penny ?
Why , that's just the way to frustrate their plans and defeat their absurd intentions .
Sir , that's well said and well thought out .
But enough about that .
Was he sad or happy ?
Oh , here comes the storm again .
No , it's dreadfully steep .
You have to read us the will , Caesar's will .
I'm afraid that may be the case , madam .
And will you have me ?
The poor thing !
You sent me to the port to find a ship .
I would have thrown away all other considerations and made her my wife .
I'm your master , Dromio .
I came to Venice with a number of Antonio's creditors who say he won't be able to avoid going bankrupt .
Just to the Tower , I'm guessing , for the same reason you are : to salute the noble princes who are staying there .
I'll be crippled forever !
Let me know .
His heart used to burst the buckles on his breastplate in great fights , but now he's lost all temperance and dedicates his heart to satisfying the lust of an Egyptian whore .
He who is dizzy thinks the world is spinning" , please , tell me what you meant by that .
Let this solemn melody comfort your fevered minds , which are now useless , seething inside your skulls. , All of you stand there in my spell. ,
Why are you defying me in this urgent matter ?
I could drink hot blood and do such terrible deeds that people would tremble even in the daylight .
Where is she now ? , What , will my hands never be clean ? , No more of that , my lord , no more of that .
I'll be damned if the duke wouldn't have given him six pence a day for playing Pyramus .
He's killed his wife !
They're certainly a peaceful couple !
And now she'll start moaning , of course , Are you asleep , my love ?
Anyway , how are you , Jessica ?
I wish she were in heaven so she could appeal to some power to make this dog Jew change his mind .
What , you're leaving it with Lysander ?
Agincourt .
Meanwhile I'll stay with Regan with my hundred knights .
You're in the charge of an honorable man .
Now , if you occupy some place in the list of men that isn't down at the very bottom , tell me .
I'm surprised I didn't bite back .
The clock has chimed midnight .
We'll let you .
He's great-looking , but how can you talk to someone who doesn't speak your language ?
Then I will swear to Kate and you to me , and may our oaths be faithfully kept and prove fortunate .
Some French agents are already at work in our main ports and are on the verge of declaring open war .
The Lord in heaven bless you , noble Harry !
Let's carry him in triumph to his house !
Don't hurt me , please .
Have all his business ventures failed ?
We all must die , Messala .
I have to ask you , as a favor , not to let on that you recognize me until the time is right .
ate at home , but the jeweler says he didn't .
Oh earth , which soaks up this blood , revenge his death !
It has leaked out that you're hiding here .
I think he only loves life because of Bassanio .
Indeed , my lord , the gloomy Jaques grieves over these deaths .
Think about our situation , then die .
Oh , immortal gods !
I wouldn't think much of it even if it were heavier .
A drunkard or a corpse ?
Just now , my lord .
His life was gentle , and the elements mixed so well in him that Nature might stand up and say to all the world , "This was a man." Let's treat him according to his virtue , with all the respect and rituals of burial .
Me too .
Yes , that one .
Just as Antony loves .
If she is silent and won't speak at all , I'll praise her chattiness and say she speaks with piercing eloquence .
A thin face , which you don't have ; a sleepless , sunken eye , which you don't have ; an irritable temper , which you don't have ; a neglected beard , which you don't have , but that might not be so telling , since you don't have much beard anyway .
Will you break my heart ?
Noble words , sir .
Oh Iago !
Is that the man you want ?
To the field !
I will have to go on a journey to death soon , sir .
I wish you'd won the Something bad in that letter is making Bassanio turn pale .
Can I have a word with you ?
Murderer !
Actors can't keep a secret .
We've been betrayed !
But in your daughter's womb I will bury them .
But why aren't you in your shop today ?
You and I , and honest Casca , we have epilepsy , we've fallen .
Wait a minute , Jew .
Who doesn't know that the good duke is dead ?
By our beards ( if we had them ) , you are a knave .
I don't think he'd have any choice , my lord .
He's his mother's child from head to toe .
Then immediately call the rest of the watch together and thank God that you've gotten rid of such a criminal .
Her curses have made my hair stand on end .
Can it be possible that no one saw them leave ?
I'd rather be hung in chains from one of our pyramids !
I've never been more useful to you than I will be now .
Why would anyone flatter a poor person ?
I'd rather overload my liver with wine than starve my heart by denying myself fun .
Speak , man .
Where should I go ?
Get out , you horrible bastard , or I'll gouge out your eyes .
Not that we love words more than fighting , like you do .
Well , let's sit down and listen to Barnardo tell us .
I'm no villain .
If you knew the reason , you'd understand and would urge me to go rather than stay .
How does it go with my magnificent Mark Antony ?
Battered armor , be off .
Yes , my good lord .
Good news , good news !
I've seen you fight and envied your skill .
Don't joke about his predictions .
This is the silliest thing I've ever seen .
Not until you pass out .
Little birds do it , and dragonflies copulate right in front of me .
Why , wouldn't you ?
Who is to blame for this : Antony or I ?
That'll happen soon enough .
Stars , my lord .
I'm not sure , but I don't think so .
I want to head out tonight .
How long have you believed in astrology ?
He's married , madam .
Let's meet as little as we can .
From then on we'll turn our backs on Athens .
I'll go look for him , Cassio , stay around here .
The rest of the dead are princes , barons , lords , knights , squires , and gentlemen of birth and rank .
Your shoes are in pretty bad shape .
I always pray for them
It'll help us more than hurt us .
Come , lady ; you must die in order to live .
What should I say to her ?
Yes , sir .
My name is Edgar , and I'm your father's son .
Sister , let's eat and stop worrying .
What's that noise ?
No , great king .
Tell us , old Egeon : are you the man who once had a wife named Emilia , who gave birth to two fair sons ?
Here comes the man himself .
I sent the French queen with him too , for the same reason .
I'll tell you what to do .
Oh , sir , Don't think I'm flattering you .
No ?
Don't spend any more time here .
giving it back to him .
This is Antonio , my dearest friend .
So get ready to leave .
Still , I'd hate to see my former dreams return .
If he'd written nice things , I'd swear yes right away .
Oh , what a horrible day !
But I have to remember that I'm here on Earth , where doing evil is often praised , and doing good is sometimes a stupid and dangerous mistake .
If he had as many lives as he's got hairs on his head , I would've killed them all in revenge .
Those cowardly , gigantic sides of beef have been responsible for many of your family members getting eaten as a condiment on beef .
Nothing .
Go find those herbs for him , before his madness puts his life in danger .
At this time of night ?
I hope to God it's something political , like you think , and not jealousy involving you .
Oh cousin , cousin , cousin , my sweet little cousin , I wish you knew how deep in love I am .
It was a huge mistake to let old Gloucester live after we blinded him .
If my doing what you told me to makes you happy , then be happy , because I did it .
Yes , but swear by my sword this time .
Don't you , Dromio ?
I'll think of something .
I'll take the Queen into my custody .
Adieu .
Ah , good old Kent said this would happen , that poor , banished man .
Which one is it ?
On me , though I am barely half the man that Edward was ?
Get yourself to a convent , fast .
Oh , Cassius , Brutus gave the orders too soon .
How will I recognize you in the future ?
He doesn't know he's been appointed governor yet .
All right , go ahead , keep up your little game , pretend to be sympathetic , but then nudge each other and wink and make faces at me when I turn my back .
I honor him for being brave .
The senate has decided to give mighty Caesar a crown today .
And the ghost frowned just like the king did once when he attacked the Poles , traveling on the ice in sleds .
What is , my lord ?
It's almost ten o'clock .
Good God , I was about to say something .
Forever and forever , farewell , Cassius !
Enjoy your frankness ; it suits you .
I'm off , my lord .
Let me shake your hand .
Well , the poor man died by your first order , which was carried by a winged messenger .
You won't find any cause for anxiety , even if you look for one .
All of us have reason to mourn the dimming of our shining star the king .
Then sing it .
You'll fight with him eventually , and The duke , my father , loved his father very much .
Neither my husband nor the slave has returned , even though I sent the slave off running .
If you forgive us , we'll make everything all right .
You are too expensive to wear every day .
And just for today , Oh , Lord , just today don't think of the crime my father committed in seizing the crown !
Fast asleep ?
I'll either fight you , Macbeth , or else I'll put down my sword unused .
The queen your mother is upset , and sent me to see you .
Are you begging , brother ?
If my eyes aren't deceiving me , goodbye , love .
Are you crazy ?
I'm telling you this story for a reason .
Sir , he's with Caesar .
Any obstacle or barrier to Claudio's happiness will be like medicine to me .
Agreed .
Doesn't a Jew eat the same food , get hurt with the same weapons , get sick with the same diseases , get healed by the same medicine , and warm up in summer and cool off in winter just like a Christian ?
Come like shadows and depart in the same way !
Come , come , let's remember why we're here .
Partly to confirm my opinion and partly for the satisfaction , see , of my mind , with respect to the demands of proper military practice , that's the point ?
But give words a chance .
I've wanted to see you for a long time now , but I sent for you so hastily because I need your help right away .
Go bring them here .
He's a good fellow , I can tell you that much .
And yet I feel it's very hot and humid , which is bad for my complexion .
Lucentio , sir .
Who can prosecute me for it ?
Wonderful !
He hasn't done anything to harm you yet .
And when you get married , I hope I can be married at the same time .
Now be quiet .
We're absolutely not here to delight you .
He builds our fires , gets our firewood , and does all kinds of useful things for us. , Hey !
You're sure the handwriting is your brother's ?
Fulvia's death and the pressing concerns related to it are not the only reasons I am eager to go ; friends in Rome have also sent many letters advising my return .
I wish I were as big and strong as you .
If that is not granted , he reduces his requests and asks only that he be allowed to live as a private man in Athens .
I'll beat him despite his fancy fencing techniques and all the practicing he does , despite his youth and manliness .
Take credit , God , for it is no one's doing but yours .
If anyone here knows a better way to tame a shrew , speak up , please .
No lie , she screamed at you .
Did you send for him , sir ?
By Jesus , I think they will blow up everything if we don't improve our tactics .
In my travels , great scholars have come up to me , meaning to greet me with well-rehearsed welcoming speeches , and I have seen them tremble and turn pale , and pause inappropriately in the middle of their sentences , and botch their well-rehearsed tones of voice because they're so nervous , and then break off abruptly at the end , without actually welcoming me .
Don't deceive me .
You don't know whether it was wisdom or fear that made him flee .
Let's put our heads together .
I can't put my feelings into verse , but please believe I love you best , oh , best of all .
A man who's robbed , but doesn't miss what's stolen , isn't robbed at all .
Swaggering ?
Please don't make fun of me .
We're following you not only because it is our duty , but also because we want to .
Love each other and be friends , like two such men should be .
Wait , don't rush !
Fill my cup , Lucius , until the wine overflows it .
Don't worry , I couldn't care less .
What's that noise ?
Yes , and I'll give it to him for free .
You can't go any further with us , sir .
You are lesser than Macbeth but also greater .
So you're the only one who could play Pyramus .
He would have gotten a pension of six pence a day for his whole life .
What's happening to me , that I'm frightened of every noise ?
What do kings have that private men do not , besides the pomp of their position ?
Can a man do it ?
We shouldn't displease him .
So good-bye for now .
Stand away from the body .
I can't say no .
You will love more than you are loved .
Well , it's as plain as the beaten path to a parish church .
Whenever you like .
If your master wants a queen to beg from him , you should tell him that a queen will beg for no less than a kingdom .
I think it's important .
Sir , sir , that can't be true .
Let's not talk about it .
Who are all these people ?
How foolish your fears seem now , Calphurnia !
And I think this is his house .
I have an aunt who is a widow , who's very rich and doesn't have any children .
You are as well provided in both respects as any prince in the world .
Have I accomplished so much in battle , but now I'm afraid to tell some old men the truth ?
Yeah , and he's going to tame her .
Even if you're not a traitor , you're going to look like one if you run away .
Shall we not ?
Who , me , my lord ?
Let the envoy from Antony come in .
Your father was an extremely moral man , and religious people get odd ideas on their deathbeds .
Right now we're shaken up by fears and doubts .
I have the best armor in the world .
If he is too insistent , tell him that romance is like a dance : it has its own rhythm and timing .
Isn't he here ?
I need to hear the truth about all this .
Men's faces are truthful , whatever their hands do .
Well then , Margaret , Ursula , and my cousin have been very much deceived , for they swore you did .
Good food's not a big deal , everyone can afford that .
If you have me , you have me now at my worst ; and if you have me , you'll appreciate me better and better .
They're forgiven , then , if they don't see what they're doing .
Let the Egyptians and Phoenicians go swimming .
But you promise you can keep a secret ?
What do you mean , your highness ?
Mend" me , you impertinent fellow ?
What , is today a holiday ?
Is that chain you're wearing the one you promised to give to me ?
Farewell , good Strato .
Please , try to act a little more serious , or the people in Belmont will get the wrong impression about me , and your wildness will make me blow my chance with Portia .
I weep for Caesar in that he was good to me .
That's all there is to say .
What is she saying , my lord ?
Gave me , sir ?
You've humiliated him , lady : you've put him down .
Remember the reward we're getting when the deed's done .
I have to do it , I have to do it .
I never tried to win over a friend or enemy with sweet words .
Not if you go away , there isn't .
Good afternoon , my dear lord !
Yes , my lord .
I'm glad about that .
Come on , then .
Three proper young men , all good looking and with great presence ,
He who will not follow me now , let him depart and stand in the doorway like a pimp , cap in hand , while some slave , no nobler than my dog , violates his daughter .
Yes , my lord , and calfskin too .
It is .
I hope your Majesty will , in all good conscience , bear me out and vouch for the fact that this is the glove of Alencon and that your Majesty gave it to me .
I'd swear he wouldn't leave it behind , or even take it off his finger , for all the money in the world .
Honest , my lord ?
Now that I think about it , I really want it .
I'll ask only Benedick to come with me , for from the top of his head to the soles of his feet he's a joker .
If you would have such a man , take me .
Are you familiar with the case currently before the court ?
I love you with so much of my heart that none of it is left to protest with .
She has a low-pitched voice .
The king will already have left Southampton .
Know him ?
Merciful heaven !
Leonato , am I standing here ?
We must form a better opinion of ourselves if our uprising can pull the insatiable Antony's attention away from that Egyptian widow .
Tell us .
Better , since your lordship was nice enough to ask .
Where do you want me to go to respond to these charges ?
Here comes the good Macduff .
Tell her that the entire East shall call her Queen." Then he nodded and solemnly mounted an armored warhorse , which neighed so loudly it effectively silenced anything I might have said in reply .
I don't know what private grudges they had that made them do it .
It's not for me to say .
Where would Othello go ? , Oh , look at you !
I'm going to sell all my land .
Oh my God , what a terrible world this is !
How old is she ?
My own ears heard it , and you know it .
Thank you , sir .
You might as well try to stab the air with your sword .
Shall Kate be my wife ?
Are you thinking of buying her ?
Since your woes are only a portion of mine , I have every reason to surpass your lamentations and drown out your cries with my own .
Please just name a time , but don't wait more than three days .
Is it good news ?
The Roman people are fed up with his arrogance already .
Let go of his arm .
You are Dromio , you are my servant , and you are yourself .
If you'd been as wise as you were bold , With an old man's mature judgment , You wouldn't have had to read this scroll .
Stay here .
To me it looks like a weasel .
No .
Good heavens , those are difficult directions .
If I were your average fool , or if I made my feelings for you worthless by making the same promises of friendship to everybody , or if you'd seen me first flattering men , hugging them tightly , and later slandering them behind their backs , or if you hear that I drunkenly declare friendship at banquets with all the rabble , only then , of course , go ahead and assume I'm dangerous .
The things that threaten me have only seen my back .
Damn that crazy madman !
They're wise and honorable , and will no doubt give you reasons for it .
Lazy people end up at the bottom , and you deserve to be at the top .
I wish you well .
In its tail .
If we leave , it will feel like nothing less than death to them .
Good-bye .
How literal this guy is !
Go , blockheads , go , and bring my supper to me .
And now I'll do it .
Where's Seleucus ?
He'll accompany my wife , and bring whatever else you think I might need .
First of all , even if all the obstacles were eliminated and my path led straight to the crown , if it were truly my birthright , I would rather hide from my greatness than hide inside the greatness of the position itself and be smothered by it .
So with no money , but a little more wisdom , I'm going back to Venice .
Hurry up , Robin , and make the night dark and cloudy .
You've kept away from me for a week ?
Listen to you , instructing me like a parrot would .
Many people have told me so .
Let's go , because it's already after midnight , and we want him on our side before daylight .
I don't care what he told you in Latin .
By God , your doors were locked and you were shut out .
I laugh at any weapon used by a man who was born from a woman .
I wish there wasn't so much dew on the ground .
Where ?
Thanks , good Egeus .
Now please leave me alone .
Look how she carries on with him !
Delighted to stay ?
No , by our Lady , I don't think he can .
In order to flatter Caesar , would you flirt with the servant who laces up his pants ?
Then teach your cousin to also be willing to close her eyes , my lord .
Be patient , because the prize I'm leading you to will make you forget how smelly you are now .
It's expressly against the rules of combat .
Yes , here it is .
The king , whom I hope God will protect better than you would like , can't get a minute's rest without you bothering him with your outrageous complaints .
A mature age .
You're busted .
Leave , you little man .
The noise is coming from over there .
Next thing you know , he'll be saying "widower Aeneas." "Widow Dido , " did you say ?
Come , explain .
Fool , do not flatter yourself .
Ride out to the horsemen on that hill .
It's not because I don't love you .
If you killed Lysander while he was sleeping , then you're already up to your ankles in blood .
Mankind's role is to fear and tremble when the almighty gods send warning signals .
Add to these eight thousand four hundred knights , squires , and brave gentlemen , five hundred of whom were given the title of knight only yesterday .
I never saw a woman except her and Sycorax , my mother .
Tell me , you monster , where is my son Lucentio ?
Thinking , my lord ? " My God , you keep repeating everything I say as if you were thinking something too horrible to say out loud .
And what an excellent piece of work it is , too , madam lady !
Farewell , my lord .
Look over your lines again .
Night is approaching .
I have so much care and pity for you that you could call me friend .
With any luck , the sea and new countries will push out these thoughts that have somehow taken root in his mind .
Good. , Now come , Ariel !
Stay near me so I'll remember .
Why should I now have to make do with only twenty-five ?
What would you have said , my young York ?
Yes , my lord .
I told him we'll stay for at least a month , and he says that he hopes we'll stay longer .
Le Roy ?
May God and his angels guard your sacred throne and grant that you dignify it for a long time .
I wish I could give you the little strength that I have .
You'll never see me again , whether or not he's dead .
But step aside , fairy !
But tell me what you're fighting about .
Good Captain Blunt , tell the earl goodnight from me , and tell him that by two in the morning I would like him to visit my tent .
But Audrey , there's a boy in the forest who claims you're his girl .
Well , okay. , I swear to God , both their stories match .
I've changed my mind now and partly believe in omens .
He was somewhere in the middle , between them.. .
He did , my lord .
Today Pompey laughs away his fortune .
The world's a liar .
Only if the hearer is a fool or a coward .
What a stupid man he's become !
But major issues must come before minor ones .
Who gets up from a meal with the same appetite he had when he sat down ?
Is he here ?
Go ahead if you want , but remember that crying doesn't suit a man .
Wait , madam .
Drunk ?
My sword will talk for me .
I've been alive for twenty-eight years , and I've never met a man who knew what was good for him .
Well , I'll get married one day , just to see .
Twenty crowns .
Knock , knock !
I'm sure everything will be fine .
He's an honest man who detests evil actions .
And you're not suited for any place except hell .
The criminal is the one who stole the nest .
We were somewhere where I couldn't pick a fight with him , but I've decided to wear it in my cap until I see him again , whereupon I'll give him a little piece of my mind .
I've heard many of the noblest Romans , next to immortal Caesar , speaking of you , complaining of the tyranny of today's government , and wishing that your eyes were working better .
Let's go find that hussy , Fortune , and and mock her till she starts distributing her gifts more equally .
And you , sweet Hero ?
One weakness led to another , to make me hate myself .
It's certain .
You men are rank beginners !
If you wish .
Please treat my babies well .
Look at you , thrashing about like a blind man .
I'll lie here tonight .
Contagious infection of humanity , give me a chance to condemn you for the evils I know you've committed .
The enemy approaches with great display .
Pay attention to Metellus Cimber .
Then please tell me he's all right .
My brother's servants used to be my equals .
I thank you for that quip , good Tranio .
You'll see .
My lady , with your permission , this note authorizes me to give myself to you with a kiss .
Read it .
It's a lucky sign , isn't it ?
So the life that died with shame Lives on with fame .
I know him well .
My dear lord , tell me what's bothering you .
Thank you .
We have not betrayed you .
Polite sir , let me say one thing .
Goodbye , my husband .
He sent me word that , whether I liked it or not , he liked it fine .
What ?
I could do it easily now .
Excuse me .
Shylock , they're offering you three times the money you lent .
Okay , I'm ready .
Stephano !
That you lift the death sentence on my servant , who killed a rowdy and belligerent former servant of the duke of Norfolk .
Admit you were wrong .
Her father loved me and used to invite me to his house often , continually asking me about my life and all the battles I've fought .
I could drown the world .
You'll have your answer soon .
I'm telling you to make a fist and pound .
I'll take the banner from a trumpeter and use that .
Very near , my master .
When he woke , he wouldn't know where he was .
I'm not going to waste any more time with you .
Try being sick , great greatness , and see if ceremony can cure you !
Your mistress's marks ?
Once he's carried our treasure where we want it , we'll free him of the load and turn him loose like a jackass , to shake his ears and graze in the public pastures .
Tell us your name , sir , truthfully .
And even though you were brought up as a gentleman , you patiently tolerated more hardships than savages could withstand .
God gives those gifts , I had nothing to do with it .
I invite you all aboard my ship .
No , you won't get a word out of me .
Is tomorrow the 15th of March , boy ?
That's what Fulvia told me .
With the handicap they've given me , I think I'll win .
Oh , Antony , you extravagantly generous man , how would you have rewarded me for serving you faithfully when you reward my badness with all of this gold !
It's a very pleasing night to honest men .
Those who were bitter enemies of your father in his time have turned their bitterness to sweetness , serving you loyally and wholeheartedly .
I wouldn't change it except to make you think of me , my darling queen .
I'd be angry with you if the occasion allowed .
Mine , too .
Some villains in my court must have known about this and let it happen .
My strength is all gone , as if in a dream .
If he's caught the Benedick , he'll lose all his money before he's cured .
It's come again .
Take him to the surgeons .
Because you gave me something for nothing .
They are here at court now , and I believe they've been told to give a performance for him tonight .
Then I beat my drum , at which point they pricked up their ears and opened their eyes , looking around for the source of my music .
As Edgar , I'm nothing at all .
No , your words are too precious to be wasted on dogs .
I eat the air , like chameleons do .
Sweet flowers for a sweet girl .
Wasn't that letter from Jessica ?
Fulvia is dead .
My own flesh and blood turned against me !
What , aren't you a Christian ?
Fast work and a little luck are all I need. , Brother , could I have a word with you ?
No , you can't sign a contract like that for me !
My friends told me as much , and I knew it , too .
But where is Kate ?
How did they die ?
Take my hand , Hastings .
I have it ready for you .
This is for your master's sake , not mine .
Come on now , wine is good for you , if you know how to use it .
Who said that I was disdainful , and that I got all my best lines out of a bad joke book ? !
Come with me to see the duchess .
Let's follow the old earl , and get that crazy Tom to take him wherever he wants to go .
Worthy sir , greetings !
Say I will love her everlastingly .
I am unfit to rule and to be king .
His neigh is like a monarch's command .
There's music coming out of thin air .
Isn't it strange ?
An evil soul using a holy story is like a criminal who smiles at you .
Why did you cry out in your sleep ?
Don't attack by land .
Oh , you're sticking a dagger in me !
I wish I were in an alehouse in London !
Look , here's the necklace .
You take the bill and I'll take your yardstick .
Yes , it's true , sir .
I need to get away from you .
What do you think ?
Well , thank God I'm cured !
I dreamed last night that I feasted with Caesar , and unlucky signs overwhelmed my imagination .
Do you remember the circumstances ?
Thieves !
I don't wish that on you .
Oh , dear gods !
No , gentle madam .
All right , sir , I will .
And what will you do if it returns to you ?
Release me So I can return to my dukedom With your help .
Who put my servant in the stocks ?
Fled to England ?
No doubt , my lord .
Don't worry , I won't .
The people are on my side , and I'm in charge of the sea .
When the forked blue lightning seemed to break open the sky , I put myself right where I thought it would hit .
And yet I think you look with your eyes just like every other woman does .
Come on .
I'll do anything you ask , monster , anything reasonable. , Come on , Trinculo , let's sing .
I've seen the whole thing , and it's completely worthless , unless you think their bad acting and their misremembered lines , which they memorized so painfully , are funny .
Mine , neither .
You lie .
He goes forth to war bravely .
Isn't that the reason you told me all this ?
You and I , Kate , we are the makers of custom , and the freedom that goes with our position silences all who would criticize , as I will silence you for upholding the prudish custom of your country in refusing me a kiss .
Please call him and tell him to come back here .
None , my lord .
Are you kidding ?
Adultery ?
But mistress , know yourself .
I remember .
I'm still young enough to see without glasses , and I don't see what you're talking about .
You're going to pay for this , Roderigo .
Did Cicero say anything ?
Yes , you're right , her name is Margery .
You're naughty .
The skin is good for your cracked head .
Hell and damnation !
He's right over there .
Do you want to know who they are , then ?
Come on , let's all go inside .
What a day this is !
What's the matter ?
I will , my lord .
I don't mean he's
Victory is with us .
Octavius , lead your forces slowly out to the left side of the level field .
Madam , his majesty asks for you , and for you , Duke of Gloucester , and for you , my noble lords .
Where's Publius ?
But do you mean what you're saying ?
Nothing but cruel daughters could have degraded him like this .
No , you're just reminding me of something I've also noticed .
No , villain , but you didn't work alone .
Damn it , you're not listening to me !
I don't think so .
Royal Egypt , Empress !
They will tell me more , because I'm determined to know the worst about what's going to happen .
I will not live to hear the news from England .
Tell me , friend .
The thing is definitely going to be sold .
Until her beautiful life's end .
I'd prefer to keep my mistress rather than some lame horse .
Good riddance ! , Close the curtains and leave. , I hope everyone who looks like him will make the same choice .
and affection , even if it's just an act .
That it was , sir .
On the way , we came across my wife , her sister , and their gang of vile associates .
And then throw the seeds in the sea , to make more islands grow .
I'm Lorenzo , your love .
You have forgotten , and you think it's a burden when I ask you to walk through the ocean , or run on the north wind , or do business for me underground when the earth's frozen solid .
I can't blame her .
To our horses , you gallant princes .
Yes , sir , but not when I'm enraged .
They have to stay there .
Arm myself ?
Any trick that works is good for me .
If she won't tell Benedick , someone else should .
I have nothing to do with what you're talking about , my lord .
What do you mean ?
There's a farmer here who won't leave without seeing your Highness .
Don't dishonor your mothers !
Is it because of
Wholeheartedly , good young man .
If I weren't forbidden to tell you the secrets of
Honestly , I didn't see it , but I felt it in her hot breath .
Well , anyway , goodbye .
Give me that boy and I'll come with you .
You may do whatever you want in the world .
Whom do you serve under ?
And me too .
What if I'd said I saw him do something to hurt you ?
For you , I give myself away and I'm ecstatic about the exchange .
He has a father , and yet he is fatherless .
Where are my good fellows ?
Snip and snip and cut and slash , it's got more holes than a sieve !
Mistress , your father requests that you leave your books and come help decorate your sister's room .
Signior Gremio , are you coming from the church ?
You know that I used to believe in Epicurus and his disregard for omens .
I have a pretty good ear for music .
I've seen her do it .
Well , I'm sorry for your niece .
I'm warning you .
By Isis , I'll give you bloody teeth if you ever compare Caesar with Antony , my best man among men .
Sir , I believe this piece of trash , Bianca , has something to do with all this trouble. , Hang in there , Cassio. , Come here , bring the light .
I do .
Not true , not true .
But what about the bloody handkerchief ?
Lord Edmund didn't speak to your master at home ?
There are more things in heaven and earth , Horatio , than you've even dreamed of .
The weakest fruit drops to the ground first , so let me drop .
I will , my Hermia .
In the meantime , I'll raise an army that will surpass his .
Go ahead , do your worst .
My soul is stuck to sin , and the more it struggles to break free , the more it sticks .
I heard someone say that's what it means .
I hear that Edgar , Gloucester's exiled son , is with the Earl of Kent in Germany .
After all , who would put up with all life's humiliations , the abuse from superiors , the insults of arrogant men , the pangs of unrequited love , the inefficiency of the legal system , the rudeness of people in office , and the mistreatment good people have to take from bad , when you could simply take out your knife and call it quits ?
He gets up at nightfall and wanders around till dawn .
Kent's been banished just like that ?
Please .
Your overwhelming kindness makes me weep .
He's pretty awful in the morning when he's sobering up , and even worse in the afternoon when he's drunk .
Tell my servants not to mention that we were gone .
All of you who are looking at her , wouldn't you swear that she's a virgin , judging by these outward shows ?
I've spelled it out for you clearly .
Then we'll be stuffed with news .
I'm here , my lord .
I wish you well .
It's you we were laughing at .
No , I'll help too .
But come , my lord , let's go .
Damn your wine !
Bloody , inhuman villain !
He followed the old man .
So that England may live a long life like this , let God say amen !
Benedick and Beatrice have been waging a war of wits between themselves .
Get ready for the third hit , Laertes .
Send out more cavalry .
No , no .
What should I pay you ?
And since we dream at night , time passes quickly then .
That , stirred up by Dorset , Buckingham , and Morton , he's coming to England to claim the crown .
It's only four o'clock now .
There are only friends here .
It wouldn't surprise me , my lord .
That's good , if he'll really do it .
Give him room .
I won't deny him anything of mine , including my own body and my husband's bed .
It's gone .
Call in the messengers and we'll find out .
Then we can all three be comrades on our way to France .
Be my witness , oh you blessed moon .
This is exactly the false way that verses gallop along .
The duke is temperamental .
break out , civil war erupts , kings are betrayed , and the bond between father and son snaps .
How did he look ?
The lowest part of his hoof is more musical than Pan's pipe .
Seven days and seven nights ?
How are you doing , Stephano ?
For besides the good news , we are also celebrating his marriage .
Why are you mumbling to yourself instead of answering the order I gave you ?
Come , father , I'll leave you at a friend's house .
Yes , Celia , we kept her here for your sake .
I'll go for a short walk to calm down my feverish mind .
You come to me saying , "Shylock , we need money." You say that ! , even though you spat on my beard and kicked me like you'd kick a stray mutt out your front door .
I'll smear my face with filth , put on a loincloth , make my hair matted and tangled , and face the bad weather wearing almost nothing .
Gentlemen , go in there and grab him .
Poor man !
It would be wrong for me to think poorly of my grandmother .
I don't know how to ask you for forgiveness , but I have to say something .
Master , you were so focused on the girl herself , I wonder if you missed the main point here .
What could you possibly ask for ?
Then there's still a chance .
Don't try to find out more .
Deal ?
You've done a good job , that other men can attribute their murders to you !
You understand ?
Your true demonic features are distorting your body .
Why , so did you .
Well , give me the worst news .
If I'm not dreaming , you are Emilia .
She replied by saying that it would be better for him to be her guest instead .
He's left them to you and to your heirs forever , public pleasures in which you will be able to stroll and relax .
I don't know where he's staying , so if I told you he's sleeping here or there , I'd be lying .
I still have room for six more wounds .
How did you tolerate prison ?
You're wrong to kill me for loving you .
Not me .
The spirit is torturing me .
There's no room for the old man and his followers .
But don't go .
He's gone ?
Yes , yes , Curtis , so hurry up and start the fire .
Be patient , your highness .
Oh , teach me how you look the way you do , and which tricks you used to make Demetrius fall in love with you .
Welcome to Cyprus .
Good Lord , how bright and splendid is the moon tonight !
Oh , that's nonsense !
I won't be gone long .
I've been crazed with so many miseries that my tongue has tired of lamenting and gone mute .
Don't listen to him , Emilia , even though he's your husband .
I'm telling you all this out of affection for you , so you can either keep him from carrying out his plans or prepare to accept his disgrace , which will be his own fault , not mine .
Come on , give me your best shot .
I'll do it even if I find you in the company of the king himself .
He seems cheerful .
Come to my cave and tell me the rest of your story. , Good old man , you are as welcome here as your master is .
Wait !
No I don't , believe me .
There's more to it than that. , Ganymede !
Besides , how have I offended you , my friends ?
I'll follow it .
Is it daytime ?
Now the only person I love , and believe in , and want to look at , is Helena .
This guy has legs like a man but fins for arms !
If they seek battle with us , have them come down or else clear the field .
Madam , with all my heart .
If you can't answer it , Go ahead !
I won't .
Oh , so cruel !
Who's in there ?
And isn't a sheep's grease as wholesome as a man's sweat ?
If you have a voice or can make sounds , speak to me .
Political business is bothering him , and he's just taking it out on you .
But quiet , be quiet a minute .
God bless my old master .
Three times in an hour I saw him down , and three times up again and fighting .
From the highest to the lowest of you , I bid you a hearty welcome .
I feel sicker and sicker .
It usually only lasts about twenty seconds .
What , are you going to mock me to my face when I told you not to ?
Portia is dead .
Say anything .
Your life is stretched to its limit .
Am I that name , Iago ?
But when our vices become habits , Oh , the sadness of it ! , the wise gods blind us , shade our better judgment , make us love our mistakes , and laugh as we strut to our ruin .
All we do is sit and sit and eat and eat .
So , tell people that you're from Epidamnum-otherwise all your goods will be confiscated .
Pish to you , you mangy dog , you pointy-eared Icelandic mutt .
He wants me dead .
I don't understand .
Octavius , I'm older than you are .
They made him drink the leftover wine usually given to the poor .
He can hold his fingers in a V-shape like this , and Pyramus and Thisbe can whisper to each other through that little crack .
I myself am playing the man in the moon , Well then , that's the biggest mistake of all .
What does it matter ?
What's the matter , husband ?
Or is he on his horse ?
If he's reluctant , I can convince him .
God Almighty , there must be some essential goodness even in evil , if men would only look for it .
Let it be who it is .
Who's that ?
When powerful kings cave in to flatterers , do you think loyal men will be afraid to speak out against it ?
Oh , that's nothing , believe me , sir .
I don't make fortunes ; I only see them .
Damn it !
It's too bad .
Look and see .
But you've seen her and Cassio together .
My noble king , my friends have informed me that Sir Edward Courtney and his brother , the haughty Bishop of Exeter , are now in My king , the Guildfords in My lord , the duke of Buckingham's army , Enough , you
Who's Thisbe ?
I can tell by the way you waggle your head .
I am an ass , indeed : you can tell by my long ears .
How many infatuated people go mad with jealousy !
With all my heart , I'll go right away .
And let us swear to our resolution .
Can I justifiably and in good conscience make this claim ?
What can you see out on the ocean ?
Goodbye .
Likewise , I'm young , and my sense of reason has just ripened .
Go get my best clothes .
A snake could do that as easily as you could .
As I neglected practical matters , being totally dedicated to solitude and to improving my mind with subjects more valuable than most people imagine , I was so shut away from the world that I unwittingly stirred up evil wishes in my disloyal brother .
Just as hounds and greyhounds , mongrels , spaniels , mutts , shaggy lapdogs , swimming dogs , and wolf-dog crossbreeds are all dogs .
We're available .
And I will give you some more .
You'll be afraid to hear it .
I don't know you .
Antipholus has gone insane , no question about it .
Now we can shout , "Congratulations , congratulations , my lord and lady ! " My Lord Bassanio , and my dear lady , I wish you all the joy I can wish for .
Oh yes , you spoke , my lord , but total nonsense .
Even if these men have escaped the law and punishment at home , they can not escape God .
But by the grace of God , she's mine .
We shall , my liege .
Well , it doesn't matter .
I think you've been frowning too much recently .
Oh angels , protect us !
Agreed .
I wish I were senseless , sir , so that I wouldn't feel your punches !
Oh what a curse marriage is !
Goodbye !
You should look like an innocent flower , but be like the snake that hides underneath the flower .
How ?
But only hint at this vaguely , because , as you know , my mother's still alive .
Yes , with the sign underneath him that says : "Here lives Benedick the married man" ?
Only three so far ?
Oh , dainty duck !
We're safe from my father for at least three hours .
Oh , my lord , what do you mean by that ?
You swear never to mention what you've seen .
You've stunned him .
I'd rather be wooed by a snail .
That's why I've begged him to come on our shift tonight , so that if the ghost appears he can see what we see and speak to it .
Let's follow them .
It's my best option : I can't afford to lose forty ducats .
What's wrong ?
Show .
The ground feels flat to me .
I didn't see them .
Tell me what you've done with the money I entrusted to you .
I'll tell him all of this , dear lady .
Fierce civil war will paralyze all of Italy .
The street is narrow here .
I'm neither , my lord .
I wish you'd never met him .
They saw him just now as mad and deranged as the stormy sea , singing loudly , wearing a crown of nettles , thorns , hemlock , and all the other weeds that grow in our cornfields. , Send out a hundred soldiers to find him .
I don't understand , how should I answer that ?
Here , sir !
I seek no revenge for myself , but so dearly do I hold the safety of my kingdom , which you sought to destroy , that you must be punished according to her laws .
Isn't it past two o'clock ?
I have a good eye , uncle .
Good night , everyone .
No , I must let them find me .
If you're calling me Jephthah , my lord , I do have a daughter I love more than anything , yes .
When things are at their worst they have to stop , or else improve to the way things were before .
Shake off sleep , which looks like death , and look at death itself !
What's the news ?
I'll bandy you about and overwhelm you with my cleverness .
Go now and get cash .
Madam , I'm a bit like you in that I can't tolerate a tone of disapproval .
You're on .
Well , she got away .
Did you think I was talking about sex ?
Get out of here , before his bad luck infects you too .
Please , Emilia , ask Cassio where he was at dinner tonight. ,
Which is the lady I'm supposed to marry ?
Then they're cold friends to me .
Where is he ?
Please , get some excellent music , because tomorrow we want to serenade Lady Hero at her bedroom window .
We , now at our largest , can only decrease .
But gods , you give us faults so we'll be human .
How can we tell which of us is the oldest ?
It eases the spirit .
Claudio , take my daughter , and , with her , take my fortunes .
My master has instructed me to go to Saint Luke's to tell the priest to be ready in case you should show up with your better half .
What are these warlike noises ?
You stole it from her ?
My lord is so heavy !
I hear him mock Caesar's luck , which the gods give to men in order to balance out their subsequent wrath .
I think all tendencies to jealousy were burned out of him by the sun of his native land .
Please , don't make fun of me .
And when has he ever been known to wash his face ?
The name of Cassius gives credit to these corrupt actions , and so they go unpunished .
Be quiet , people !
She's a remarkable lady , if the rumors are to be believed .
He was wrong to do that .
He's out of his right mind .
Yes , it's Emilia .
This guy will tell us everything .
Fix your example , shepherd .
Something about Hamlet .
He's laughing already !
By God , I am not selfish when it comes to money : I don't care who eats at my expense .
I'll never see it .
She's an excellent , sweet woman , and there's no doubt that she is virtuous .
I dreamt about this .
And does she have to die for this ?
Even if we said that this behavior suits him , though only a man with a perfect character could avoid being disgraced by such antics , there's no excuse for the extra work we've had to take on while he's been off amusing himself .
You won't leave this grove until I've paid you back for this insult .
Should we part , sweet girl ?
Why , she was dead before you were even born .
Stop that alarm from ringing , it's scaring the islanders .
Good Metellus , go to him now .
Good sir , this ring was given to me by my wife .
Send the necklace to her , or send me with a token that will authorize her to pay me .
Very well .
Here .
Most noble man , will you die ?
My man Grumio !
Is that a tradition ?
It will be hard if "Cambio" loses her .
How's everyone in Verona ?
She's insistent .
Twelve years ago , Miranda , twelve years ago your father was the Duke of Milan , a powerful prince .
Listen to me , good Shylock .
And Walter couldn't get his dagger out of its sheath .
Get information from her .
Who's shouting ?
I swear , if anyone holds me back , I'll make a ghost of him !
Bring him in front of me .
What's that noise ?
I'll go get Beatrice for you , who can walk here by herself , she has legs .
The hell with her !
And can a person ever have too much of a good thing ? , Come on , sister , you can be the priest and marry us. , Give me your hand , Orlando. , What do you say , sister ?
Tell me to run , and I'll run .
I can not drink too much of Brutus's love .
I don't want her .
That means it's high time for me to go .
I played Julius Caesar .
All right ! " It's not fine , and I'm not all right !
Is it time , my Lord Constable ?
No , calm down .
Look how cheerful my mother is , only two hours after my father died .
These young children cry for Clarence and so do I , though they don't cry for Edward , as I do .
Why only a few courtiers , my lord of Buckingham ?
Why do you say that ?
What's the boy Malcolm ?
Indeed , she gives a very good testimony of the snake's power .
I think so too .
As far as I know , he's not even dead .
But please tell me , is my boy , God rest his soul , alive or dead ?
Look up moonshine , look up moonshine !
Be patient , sir !
I hope all reports about me simply tell the truth , no more or less .
Good morning , Benedick .
Meanwhile , I'd be gratified if you'd live and eat your food .
Call my sister that .
But maybe you don't like mine , or his , or hers either .
Tear him apart , tear him up !
I won't fight you .
Well , this is what happens when men let themselves be ruled by women .
Give me my robe .
So , I agree with noble Buckingham , only a few should go to meet the prince .
Yes , and I'll do everything I just said .
You're right , Lysander's admirable too .
Cheer up !
If only that were all it is , It is , I promise .
I think that our father will leave here tonight .
I hope you'll be a good father to me now .
If I let him go , I'll have to pay his bail fees myself .
We have to give up and let him go .
Why do you come here ?
Quiet now !
What's done is done .
Come on , niece , I'm sure you love him .
But I'm sure he'll get even with you .
I knew you'd turn out this way .
Though I am not a flattering , righteous man , at least you can say that I am honest about being a villain .
And isn't your husband an honorable man ?
Romans , countrymen , and friends !
Be sure to burn his magic books .
You'll see , I promise you .
Did you mention that Edward's children are bastards ?
He's not your relative .
I would rather wrong the dead , and wrong myself and you , than wrong such honorable men .
If you say that , you'll only be telling the truth .
Have you forgotten all the talks we've had together , the vows we made to be like sisters to one another , all the hours we spent together , wishing that we never had to say goodbye , have you forgotten ?
Are you going to get me in trouble ?
That's just how he is .
Do I , sir ?
It's obvious : Here comes Biondello .
Tomorrow is the day .
But now I must condemn it .
Evil can come from good , just as poisonous snakes tend to come out into the open on bright sunny days , which means we have to walk carefully .
It's too bad .
And what if they won't go ?
Goodbye , my lord .
Your face betrays strange feelings , my lord , and people will be able to read it like a book .
That you love my daughter to spite your soul .
Bellario sends his greetings .
The man in the moon !
Do you remember a Venetian scholar and soldier who accompanied the marquess of Montferrat here once when your father was still alive ?
Mistress , think about your end , beware of your death !
Even in hell you couldn't find a devil worse than Macbeth .
Look what I have here .
And then return to you and nothing else ?
Good day to both of you .
But I , who have never known how to beg and never had to beg , am starved for food , dizzy with lack of sleep , kept awake with curses and fed with brawling .
And the men resemble their English hounds in their loud , showy ferocity , too , leaving their brains behind with their wives .
Come here , monster , put some glue on your fingers , and carry away the rest of these clothes for us .
This morning , they've flown away and in their place are ravens , crows , and kites , flying over our heads and looking down on us , as though we were sickly prey .
Hurry , go !
Yes , I want it , and I'll get it .
Don't you have any brothers like you ?
Dolabella , I will always be in debt to you .
He has captured Toryne .
But she must be , Friar .
Is he angry ?
What kind of life do you lead that your poor friends must beg for your company ?
As a favor to I'm delighted .
And I'm expecting his reproach .
This is it , for now .
You are very welcome here .
You can have anything you want .
But I haven't eaten anything yet .
And I for no woman .
I ask you , if you've kept this a secret , keep doing so .
I bet I've been wrong about myself all this time .
I became his guide , I led him and begged for him , and kept him from suicide .
Ah , leave it alone .
Oh , these men , these men !
What's important is to be prepared .
Why , my boy ?
So all the work that oxen and farmers have done in plowing the fields has been for nothing , because the unripe grain has rotted before it was ripe .
I repeat , he's in love .
I think Alexander the Great was born in Macedon .
Quiet !
Why are you silent ?
Heaven knows you're as unfaithful as hell .
So let me sleep next to you .
No , please .
I wish I could be as certain of a good dinner .
Good evening , brother .
He told us to arrange it .
And , just in time , here comes the sweaty lord .
When Duke Frederick heard that great , worthy men were coming to this forest every day , he raised a large army to invade this land and fight his brother .
I'll tell everyone what you did , even if it
I need to get Othello's things from the ship .
Someone else has the same name , but he's a better man .
You're not responsible for my death and my father's , and I'm not responsible for yours .
My lord of Gloucester , I have suffered your blunt upbraidings and your bitterness toward me for too long .
I know how to tell when someone is alive or dead .
As for me , I welcome my good luck with sadness .
Yes , what about it ?
But though I was born here and should consider that tradition part of my own heritage , I think it would be better to ignore it than practice it .
I've finished it for you , and it ends in "Margaret." He's turned your curse against you , Margaret .
Goodbye .
I won't have one any bigger .
So don't spend one night away from this house .
Dissolute lowlife , you shall die .
She would have died later anyway .
He deserves it , even if it were covered with jewels like holy
I never talked with her in my life .
When the time comes , tell the herald to blow the trumpet and I'll return .
Probably because my cheeks ' roses needed rain , which I could easily give them with all the tears in my eyes .
Come with us to Athens .
And I've never met any men besides you and my father .
It's time for us to stand guard .
It's my duty , sir .
They're well too .
His feelings don't move in that direction .
This is Casca .
It will heal and be as good as new , and we'll be threatened by its fangs once again .
I've got you now , pagan .
Yes , sir .
You didn't offend us , you offended the king .
Exactly .
Then you and I and all of us fell down , while bloody treason triumphed .
If I had three ears I'd listen with all three .
You're not asleep yet , sir ?
Now you're talking .
And even if you throw everything you possess to the two of them , they'll battle each other to the death to have it all .
No .
Send me away ?
Come on , boy .
Now , tell me , which of my bad qualities did you fall in love with first ?
I am ready for you .
They know by those measurements if there will be famine or plenty .
Mark Antony is at dinner in Egypt and won't be going outside to make war .
Now we wear the wreaths of victory on our heads .
He recognizes me like a blind man recognizes a cuckoo , by its bad voice .
What did you say ?
I'm critical by nature .
There he is at the window .
But I still believe that his madness was caused by unrequited love. , Hello , Ophelia .
Before she began shedding tears all over her lovely face , she was the fairest creature in the world , and even now she has no equal .
But it is his handwriting ?
Could you have found two Romans as good as these two ?
I second that
No , come back , Kate .
You'll be back at two o'clock ?
Farewell .
Sir , do you recognize this glove ?
You !
If you lie , boy , we'll have you whipped .
But I must go there , against my will : servants must fulfill their masters ' wishes .
I can remember the past seventy years pretty well , and in all that time I have seen dreadful hours and strange things .
I can't promise that love won't transform me , but I can promise you this : until I truly fall in love , a woman will never make me act like such a fool .
You can't see the future .
I never thought any less of him .
I like doing things the old-fashioned way .
God gives you one face , but you paint another on top of it .
That makes me love you even more .
Oh , well , stay till then !
If you're being fair , you'll have to describe me as someone who loved too much , but who wasn't wise about it .
Yes , monstrous , monstrous !
Come on , tell me in broken music , for your voice is music and your English broken .
The wind blew down through the chimneys where we were sleeping .
Absolutely everything .
Go inside , Nerissa .
You always slip out of the argument like this .
She's a virtuous and holy lady .
Because he's so young , I've tried to discourage him , but he won't listen .
When Caesar says "do this , " it is done .
You seem a little depressed about this .
You dance and prance and lisp ; you call God's creations by pet names , and you excuse your sexpot ploys by pleading ignorance .
Macbeth will go there to learn his destiny .
Portia , what are you doing awake ?
That's already been done , sir .
I'll do what I can to make you even more comfortable .
Refusing to fight him at sea won't disgrace you .
That's how we'll do it , then .
Mister Challenger , the princess wants to speak to you .
What's that ?
As for Antony , I'm not interested in his requests .
That's me .
Oh , you stupid Moor !
This is the man .
joy except my love for you , and I find that only your majesty's love makes me happy .
Look !
Your worst fault is being in love .
But as of right this second all these things are yours .
Moron !
I've got nothing to do with you .
Why are you here ?
Tut , tut , you've become rather icy .
Make your confession short .
Captain , I have a favor to beg of you .
Your husband knew about everything .
It scares me just to hear you talk about it .
Oh , what evil !
I have a That's from lack of sleep .
I'll tell you : it's because of a law as plain as Father Time's bald head .
Our enemies have driven us to the edge of the grave .
Lay off , already !
All I'll tell you is that the duke has had dinner already .
But I say amen to everything she said .
This island contains everything beneficial to life .
Be sad only at the fact that you'll lose your friend , your friend doesn't regret that he paid your debt .
What do you say ?
That's an oath of great power , and our fury must subside .
When I have the juice of that flower , I'll trickle some drops of it on Titania's eyes while she's sleeping .
From Silvius , sir .
Everyone else will have to stay single .
That's Signior Baptista , will you really be this cruel ?
Wait , sweet Beatrice .
Even though she's as similar to Goneril as one crabapple is like another , still, I know what I know .
You won't see anything like that , sweetheart .
I hope he's in love .
He started it , my noble lord , and succeeding generations rebuilt it .
I've always been straightforward with you , so now I'm telling you what I think .
Now , herald , have the dead been counted ?
What ?
Your clothes aren't spattered with my family's blood , and you aren't affected by my curse .
My lord , I will help you , even if it means I have to stay awake for ten nights straight .
Don't hurt me .
Give me your hand .
Come here , captain .
Oh , that was unbelievably low !
My lord , this bill that's being proposed is the same one that was proposed in the eleventh year of old King Henry's reign .
Stay , lovely Helena .
You have my consent .
I'll ask them .
Men , wives , and children stare , cry out , and run in the streets as though it were doomsday .
Good-bye , good-bye , good-bye .
I'm amazed you got here before me .
Leave me alone now , Iago .
You certainly deserve it .
Venus went home again , and her little son broke all his arrows , swearing he'll never shoot them again , but play with birds like other little boys .
He's fainted !
I thought I heard a voice cry , "Sleep no more !
Suffer love !
I ask that none of you leave , except myself , until Antony has finished .
Portia , goodbye to you .
All this" ?
I'd rather lie in the Nile mud with flies laying their eggs in me , making me disgusting .
Near How large is his land army ?
That's it ?
But I'll marry you under different circumstances , with extravagant festivals , public festivities , and celebration .
Your attendant asses are getting the horses ready .
I am their father's mother .
Why do you need even one ?
What are you thinking ?
If this dream vision is typical of what this island conjures up , then I'll lose my son twice .
Hail , Caesar !
This man looks like his business is urgent .
Cheer up , because I think you're going to hell .
Call Claudio and some of my other men .
Will you come with us ?
I don't know what "poetical" means .
That's strange .
I hear a voice more piercing than the music of these trumpets calling "Caesar ! " Speak .
No .
What fate is that ?
I , who have survived storms at sea where the winds raged like wild animals ?
They stared at us in confusion .
I'll shut up now .
Not one drop sooner .
We'll do our duty to you , sir .
Now he lies there worth nothing , and no one is so humble as to show him respect .
You're Lear's shadow .
Then everything must really be finished .
Or in the power of reason .
And so , on the wings of imagination and at the speed of thought , our scene flies swiftly on .
They'll tell all .
This looks like an abbey .
I'll be good , sir .
I'm saying it to the girl who isn't here and doesn't hear me .
Are you sitting around in this humiliation to amuse yourself ?
Why , this was modeled on a porridge bowl !
What is logical , then , my lord ?
I won't live long enough , and all my efforts will fail me .
It blesses the one who gives it and the one who receives it .
Look at you getting all riled up !
I am glad he's coming , however he's dressed .
Come on , sister .
I think I hear the drums far away .
I wasn't born to die on your sword .
Bleed , bleed , poor country !
Go find the traitor Gloucester .
We still have time to get all of this done before daybreak .
I tell you , this will make her angry when she hears about it .
Are you hiding your forehead with a golden crown , when , if there was any justice in this world , it should be branded with the murders you committed , your slaughter of the prince who held that crown , and of my sons and my brothers ?
Actually , I should .
I won't be hit , my lord .
I never saw such a shameful act .
Either I had to ruin you , or you would have ruined me .
He's starving me to death .
That's Claudio .
Good question , my girl .
But I paid attention to where Cupid's arrow fell .
They'll assume that Cicero , with his sound judgment , ordered the actions .
It's a bad time for such an injury .
I think I do .
As I remember , Henry the Sixth prophesied that Richmond would be king when Richmond was only a foolish little boy .
I can suck sadness out of a song the way a weasel sucks eggs .
What kind of beard should I wear for the part ?
Uncle of Exeter , release the man who was arrested yesterday for railing against me .
Please , be cheerful .
I'd rather kill myself .
Aren't things going well ?
She is so generous , kind , and ready to help that she thinks it's wrong not to do everything she can , even more than she is asked to do .
We can all go together .
Show .
My lord ?
Edmund and I have talked , and it makes more sense for him to marry me than Goneril .
I am not some fiend of hell : you can't get rid of me with spells .
What is your name ?
Why do you look so depressed today , your Grace ?
It was windy on shore too .
Please , don't speak to him .
Mistress , you have to go see your father .
It sang about my crimes .
Gracious brother , I will go with them .
But one word more , He will not be commanded by you .
Don't let that lawyer ever come near my house !
I guess you don't want it .
And they've been plotting things together .
But I didn't want to be free like this .
Help !
That makes Lady Courtesy a traitor .
I want you to live , since to me , death is happiness .
You'll soon be meeting Lorenzo at supper ; he'll be a guest of your new master .
Tell me , rainbow , do you know if either Venus , the goddess of love , or her son , Cupid , is accompanying Queen Juno ?
My murders will never come back to threaten me until the forest of Birnam gets up and moves , and I will be king for my entire natural life .
If not , he's got truth on his side !
Look , here comes Helena .
My stomach's a little upset .
We should definitely say something to the Moor .
We should speak what we feel , not what we ought to say .
Help me here .
I'll flatter anyone who flatters me , though what I've accomplished on land can not be denied .
There are ten thousand , Geese , you idiot ?
Never contradict him .
This ring , sir , oh no , it's nothing .
If I can believe my eyes , this is a fine sight to see .
They say there are only five people on it .
Have a good night !
Some people say that the earth shook as if it had a fever .
Seyton ! , I'm sick at heart when I see , Seyton , come here ! , This battle will either secure my reign forever or else topple me from the throne .
He's more of a soldier than a wise man .
I'd rather have lost my legs in battle than be a part of this !
Is it out of lust ?
If she's lying , I pray that I never sleep again at night or wake up during the day .
Pretty , Cupid-like boys stood on either side of her , smiling and cooling her with multicolored fans , which seemed to fan the flames in her cheeks even as they cooled them , undoing what they did .
You should mock me I wish I were invisible , so I could grab that strong fellow by the leg .
Yes , you did .
Off !
But give them all a good dinner and look after them well .
Metellus Cimber ?
It was my magic that saved you when I arrived on the island and heard you , making the pine tree open and let you out .
My dear Portia , if you knew who I gave the ring to , for whose sake I gave the ring to him , why I gave it to him , and how unwilling I was to leave it when he wouldn't accept anything but the ring , you wouldn't be so angry .
There are enemies here .
What would you like ?
So please listen to me .
Tell me , how is my mother ?
But who is that ?
How are you going to live ?
You can have a whole story , not just a word .
Yes , just like this .
I don't owe her any duty , it's you that I submit to .
What then ?
Roderigo's been killed ?
Oh , liars can look so honest !
Tell me anything you remember .
Nathaniel's coat was being fixed , sir .
I'm not a traitor .
Let me embrace the father of Lucentio , and then we'll journey on to see your son , who will rejoice at your arrival .
Mistress , I swear on my life that it's true .
I'll kill myself to save myself from slavery .
Don't swear by the future , because you've ruined it before it has even arrived .
My liege , this was my glove .
We charge you , in the Prince's name , to stop !
I knew Temperance , she was a fine girl .
Then think about how shameful it would be for you to give in to his seductive talk and surrender your treasure chest to his greedy hands .
Why did I come here if not for that ?
What do you mean by "carriages" ?
Against my will , I've been told to bring you in to dinner." There's a double meaning in that .
Me too , otherwise I would have had to duel with Claudio .
I have to tell you everything .
Oh , Stephano , two men from Naples survived !
But I will tell you that lately the duke has been displeased with his niece , and for no other reason than that people praise her virtues and pity her for her father's sake .
I don't have it with me .
I hope this play is well cast now .
But I'm a hired hand : I don't profit from the flocks I tend .
What , are you sleepy ?
Those who have done this deed are honorable .
I'll tell you this , Constable , my mistress has his own hair .
Then Antony offered it to him again , and he refused it again ( though , in my opinion , he was reluctant to take his hand off it ) .
Michael Cassio , lieutenant of the Moor Othello , has arrived on shore .
Listen to many people , but talk to few .
Time's not the one in debt .
Go !
Why , that man is a total fraud and rascal .
You once stole my position ; now you get to have the grief that goes with it .
With this marriage , all the petty jealousies that now seem huge , and all the great fears that are dangerous in themselves , would disappear .
Alright , then I'll see you at Philippi .
That part is up to you .
No , I'm not wound up .
Only to watch that title become worthless , as her mother has .
Some people kiss shadows .
This is your job .
People who die of it seldom or never recover .
Do not , Phoebe .
What have I ever done that he has anything to complain about ?
Round enough to be unattractive .
We can't all be masters , and not all masters should be followed .
We know what's appropriate for a watch .
The king rode out alone to view their troops .
I will , sir .
I have often led you , now you must carry me , my good friends , and take my thanks for everything .
By our Lady , I think that's true .
These are bad omens , but I hope , I hope , they don't predict my future .
With one cut you can be through paying money to Naples .
The business you began here needs you as well , especially the business with Cleopatra , which only you can attend to .
CASSIO She's awake , sir .
Evil villain !
In that case it's like the words of an unpaid lawyer .
I'll follow you and turn this hell I'm in into a kind of heaven .
I'm like the one sick sheep in the flock , the one who deserves to die .
No , sir .
Let me see .
Come with me .
Madam , oh , good Empress !
Yes , yes , my lord .
He who is dizzy thinks the world is spinning .
What , out in a storm in the middle of the night ?
Yes , that's the way I'll do it .
My features are still that beautiful , or else you , the greatest soldier in the world , have become the greatest liar by overpraising them .
You might just as well say , "That's a valiant flea that dares to eat its breakfast on the lip of a lion." Yes , exactly .
Still , Edmund was beloved .
Oh , conspiracy , are you ashamed to show your face even at night , when evil things are most free ?
The powerful dukes Gloucester and Buckingham .
This Iago is extremely honest and good , and he knows a lot about human behavior .
But be quiet , here comes Thisbe .
Well , God bless this marriage !
Please , tell Benedick about her feelings and see what he has to say .
They were villains , murderers .
Pinch my nose ?
But whenever you feel a larger pain , the smaller one disappears .
But often in these cases , reports are just estimates .
Not if you want to keep your arms !
As for Hamlet and his attentions to you , just consider it a big flirtation , the temporary phase of a hot-blooded youth .
Come this way , my lord .
Follow her .
Young though I am , I've been observing these three blowhards closely .
Oh , that devious Egyptian spirit !
Calm down .
Hold on a moment , and listen to my advice .
No .
Well , go on your way , then .
I must leave them and seek some better employment .
What did you say , uncle ?
Go now , Lord Constable and all you princes , and quickly bring us news of England's defeat .
Farewell .
Eighty ducats in one shot !
Anything .
I'll fight brutally .
And what are you going to do with it ?
You wouldn't have dared , out of fear for your life .
Oh , I could weep my soul right out of myself !
Here , here , sir !
Will you have dinner with me tonight , Casca ?
Oh no !
Either Charles or some prettier thing has mastered you .
First , I ask you what they've done ; thirdly , I ask you what offense they're charged with ; sixth and lastly , I ask you why they've been committed here ; and , in conclusion , I ask what they're accused of .
Don't joke about this , Enobarbus .
Who are you ?
There is scorn and disdain in her eyes , and those sparkling eyes despise everything they look upon .
Please tell me what you're thinking , even your worst suspicions .
Come on , I'll take you , but honestly I'm only doing it out of pity .
All my pretty little children ?
According to the laws of war , you didn't have to fight a stranger .
A soothsayer tells you to beware of March 15th .
Where is she ?
I'll make ground beef out of you .
I will advise him to speak as he usually does .
Tell me , Fluellen : did you just come from the bridge ?
He says his name's Poor Tom .
As long as you move gracefully , look handsome , and say nothing , I'm yours for the dance .
I have no power over you .
I'd rather die .
I was with the heroes Hercules and Cadmus once , when their Spartan hunting dogs cornered a bear .
What , from myself ?
Goodbye .
Lysander and I are running away from here .
Even her worst faults are charming , and holy priests bless her even when she acts the slut .
Wasn't Charles , the duke's wrestler , here to speak with me ?
Here comes Sir Oliver .
Who ?
Halt !
She sees you with the eyes my daughter lent her , it's true .
I'm sticking to the contract .
If I'm more noble than you , you've done me wrong .
Go announce that he will be executed , and tell Macbeth that Cawdor's titles will be given to him .
Oh , but I'm worried .
My lord , what do you want ?
This'll be a wonderful kingdom to live in , where they play music for free .
Since you love money and power so much , I won't be your wife .
You're welcome here .
What's that ?
He is what he is .
It's very hot .
Here comes better news .
But it's dark out , and it could be a trap .
My brother didn't use my name to justify his rebellion .
Husbands need to know that their wives are human beings too .
Ha , ha !
What miracle will he work next ?
Will you go hide ?
Be kind now and tell me some excellent fortune .
Don't I tell you in the clearest terms that I do not and can not love you ?
Hail , brave friend !
Really , niece , you'll never get a husband if you keep saying such harsh things about people .
Many of you own slaves , which , like your donkeys and dogs and mules , you use to perform awful jobs just because you bought them .
Or do you want me to criticize her like I do all women ?
Then he'll be as calm and quiet as a dove waiting for her eggs to hatch .
Leave him alone .
Did you plan Cassio's death with him ?
Though I expect she'll wear me out more quickly than I'll wear out what I'm wearing , which will be good for her and even better for me !
Are you going to hide and watch them having sex ?
Did he express any dissatisfaction with you , either in his words or his face ?
Madam , what should I do ?
If either of you were a prince's son , and you were imprisoned as I am now , and two murderers like yourselves came to you , wouldn't you beg for your life ?
From under the earth .
But for your private satisfaction , because I love you , I'll tell you .
My heart , which dried out with grief , will surely break apart into a powder , and that will be the end of my disgusting mind .
Yes , and more .
Please stay below deck , sir .
You interpret my words in a melancholy sense , my hearty friends .
The food inside is warm , but you're out here freezing .
Let me talk , good lady .
But will I wear these honors for only a day or will I enjoy them for a long time ?
Sometimes I appeared in many places at once .
Do you love me ?
Titania sleeps there sometimes at night , lulled to sleep among the flowers by dances and other delights .
Yes , I remember .
I'll catch it before it falls to the ground .
Moreover , out of mercy , the Constable urges you to remind your men to make their peace with God and repent , so that their souls may depart sweetly and peacefully from these fields where , poor wretches , their bodies will likely fall and fester .
Let's go inside .
No , he's in a place worse than hell .
It's a good shilling , I promise you .
You'll just lie there like sleeping dogs and say nothing .
Indeed I do , sir , and I've come to let you in on a certain problem .
You there , sir , come here please .
On my honor and by my word , if you outstay the ten days , you will die .
I wouldn't have dared !
Good morning , old Sir Thomas Erpingham !
With God as my witness , I swear I have wept for yours .
Okay .
Go away !
Your eyes are playing tricks on you .
I thank you all for your trouble and courtesy .
Whatever happens to me , this is a soldier's kiss .
What would you like to see ?
Caesar and Lepidus are organizing their military operation .
Whom did he leave in charge here ?
Actually I think I would , and then I'd undo it after I did it .
This is not the way to win your daughter .
My trusty servant , Ariel !
What seems sweet to him now will soon turn bitter .
A lively young one !
There is laughter in heaven When earthly affairs are put right And people unite .
Well , what do you guess ?
Since you asked , I suppose it's not bragging to say that we are .
What news do you bring ?
Who wouldn't cheat on her husband to make him king ?
Cheer yourself .
No , what provoked you was your own bloody mind , which never thinks about anything but butchering .
So , possessing neither a voice nor a heart for flattery , I can't awaken the spirit of love in her so as to make him appear in his true likeness .
He who chooses me must give and risk all he has." You'd have to be more attractive for me to give or risk anything for you .
I got it from him .
The larger part , the main body of cavalry , are coming with Cassius .
Twenty thousand crowns now , and half my lands after my death .
My father's dead , and his fortune is mine now .
I'd rather have a handful or two of dried peas .
What , just because they kissed in private ?
If we welcome our punishment , we punish it right back by seeming to take it lightly .
Eros , would you like to look through a window in Rome and watch your master marching in Caesar's victory parade , his arms crossed and tied , his head bowed in submission , his face red from shame , while the chariot of triumphant Caesar precedes him , putting the final stamp to his humiliation ?
But if I ran away from the Jew , I'd be following the advice of the devil , who's the very devil himself .
But fire also gives off light , and fire will burn you .
Say what you want , but I know what I know .
Don't spoil the justness and virtue of our endeavor nor weaken our own irrepressible spirits by thinking that we need a binding oath , when the blood that every noble Roman contains within him would be proven bastard's blood if he broke the smallest part of any promise he had made .
Why do you need twenty-five knights , or ten , or even five , when you're staying in a house with a staff of double that at your service ?
Or at least I can describe the rumors .
We've been praying for our husbands ' welfare .
I'm glad you're insane enough to admit it in front of me .
I swear to God I won't .
Come , and you can have a queen .
Well , it seems to me that she is too short to be praised highly , too dark to be praised fairly , and too small to be praised greatly .
Now sit down , everybody , and rehearse your parts , Pyramus , you start .
I'm your neighbor and came courting first .
This is that time .
Fortinbras swore never to threaten Denmark again .
Believe it .
I'm afraid it will make you too hot , too .
Take these too .
My God , what a great song !
Tell me , why did the king arrive with such a small entourage ?
Have you sent anyone to Bottom's house ?
Are you so patient and forgiving that you're going to let him off the hook ?
Why , what a complicated case this is !
And he did .
Appear before me now quickly , No talking .
Yes , the duke of Buckingham and I have just returned from visiting him .
I'll give you enough gold to pay back your debt twenty times over .
Your answer ?
My brains are injured .
Whew !
I will go out .
They're louder than the storm or us sailors .
If I can cure him from his fever and tame him , and get him back to Naples , he'd make a great present for any emperor .
But in loving me , you would love the friend of France , for I love France so much that I will not part with a single village of it .
Instead of crying , let's keep hold of our swords and defend our fallen homeland like honorable men .
He's the color of nutmeg .
But he would feel even better if I could tell him that you had left Antony and put yourself under his protection .
And no doubt he is , gracious madam .
He is my dear friend , your Majesty .
He knows no more about the proper practice of war , see , the ancient practices , than a puppy .
Next month he'll stay with us .
Go look for him .
My friend , your husband , the honest , honest Iago .
If I can just get him to drink one more glass after what he's drunk already , he'll be as argumentative and eager to fight as a little dog .
Apologize ?
It's "never get tired." Oh !
And as king I'll love you forever .
Think about it .
The same thing .
My lord , could I have a word with you ?
Better men than you have heard me speak my mind , and if you can't take it , then you'd better plug your ears .
Get yourself to a
You gave money to me ?
But don't kill my sister and her royal sons , be satisfied , dear God , with our blood , which is being spilled unjustly , as you know .
Oh , I see .
That would make anyone cry enough to water his garden with his tears .
Find out what this villainous Edgar is thinking , Edmund .
It's a good tragedy , very well done .
What should I call you when you're a man ?
Borachio .
My lord ?
Oh , there's the problem .
By the end I will either live , or else I'll restore my honor by shedding my blood .
So can I .
If his cause is wrong , our obedience to the king clears us of responsibility for it .
I beg you not to do this , my lord .
Yes , my lord .
I hereby grant your request , and hope you have a good time .
If you can't remember the stupidest little thing love made you do , you haven't loved .
A pound of human flesh taken isn't even as valuable as a pound of mutton or beef .
Set down your honorable load , men , if there is ever any honor in being dead .
Oh , he hasn't ?
Love's not love when it gets mixed up with irrelevant outside matters .
All hail , Macbeth !
Oh , she's so witty and creative !
Let us die honorably .
If you would take the trouble to study the tactics of Pompey the Great , I can tell you that you would find no tittle-tattle or pibble-pabble in Pompey's camp .
Tortured ,
I will .
Even though I'm mad , I won't bite him .
Quiet , everyone !
My lord and brother , God save you .
Very well , my supreme lord , that's what I have to call you now .
Are you coming monster ?
I'm glad to see you .
Now get on with your story .
Like gambling , sir ?
This is just a trifling matter here , sir .
The sorrow that I feel actually belongs to you , and the high life you enjoy actually belongs to me .
An old Italian fox is never that generous , my boy .
Your wife wouldn't like it if she were here to hear you make that offer .
The voice kept crying , "Sleep no more ! " to everyone in the house .
You'll never hear from the herald again .
I hope so .
Brutus , what will we do ?
All these aging faculties tell me , and I can not be wrong , that you are my son , Antipholus .
The candle is burning in your study , sir .
If he becomes pale , I know what to do .
I have to make do .
She's dead , my Queen .
You see , her eyes are open .
Give him a noose to hang himself .
Right away , Caesar .
You don't know why we came to visit you , Yes , and so unexpectedly , at night .
Welcome , lady .
Call me the worst liar ?
Now I have to go find some dewdrops and hang a pearl earring on every cowslip flower .
I didn't , my lord .
I never felt it until now , two thousand ducats in that diamond , and other precious , precious jewels !
Let me embrace you .
Now two things still need to be done .
He's not wise enough to be brave .
Are you with a Cornish company ?
He is close to death , but not dead yet .
I'm going to make you a rich man .
Is it gone ?
Hunt them down .
Oh , my heart !
It shall be seven o'clock before I get on my horse .
There's no masquerade tonight .
Now I'm in a great hurry , as I'm sure you can see .
I won't say no to you , but let it be known that I'm only doing this after a lot of persuasion and to save your life , I hear you were quickly wasting away without me .
Our Queen is dead too .
Yes , exactly .
Don't I have a reason to be angry , you disobedient hags ?
In that case you should sleep .
Ha !
So submit to my mercy or , like men who revel in their own destruction , challenge me to do my worst .
What am I , a cane ?
Therefore , by law , you are condemned to die .
The Dauphin really wants it to be morning .
Or if you haven't sat as I do now , boring your listener with all your lover's virtues , then you haven't loved .
Everyone knows where a wasp wears its stinger .
What , are you dead , my dove ?
That's me you're talking about , the playful wanderer of the night .
I know the king and queen sent for you .
But can I have some hope ?
To show you that that's me , let me prove it a little even in this case .
Now any effort ruins what it attempts .
We don't think so , my lord .
Tell him a messenger has arrived from my master with good news .
Come , let's join our hands until the overpowering wine makes us soft and forgetful .
Ha , ha !
Give her this key , and tell her that there's money in the desk that's covered with a Turkish tapestry .
He laughed at that and let me go .
Nothing .
Master , should I watch the door ?
I wasn't expecting you , and I'm not ready to receive you .
Well , the Shall we get moving ?
What do you think of this plan ?
Come on , you and I will go soon .
What's going on in here ?
I'll take responsibility for it .
He does , and now he's taking revenge on you , for breaking promises and for murder , too .
Welcome , my good Alexas .
So everyone goes off into the world except me , who stays in because I'm sunburned .
But if it overwhelms you to look at Caesar's wounded cloak , how will you feel , kind men , now ?
The Turks are heading for Cyprus with a powerful fleet .
Where have Come here , boy .
Raise all the money you can .
Fair and noble hostess , we are your guests tonight .
But please tell me , sir , is your marriage Let him do his worst .
How could he be in debt without me knowing it ?
Daughters who can make you obey them .
In a minute , sir .
It must be a spirit .
If you weren't my brother , I'd leave this hand of mine on your neck until I'd pulled out your tongue for talking like this .
What , should I stab him while he sleeps ?
Yes , my lord , if you would like .
James Tyrrel , and your most obedient subject .
I remember him well , and my memory tells me that he deserves your praise .
Be patient until I finish .
I'll get the general's surgeon .
I'll let you know my answer shortly .
That huge black cloud over there looks like a filthy liquor jug that's about to pour out its contents .
You give your best praise to the worst women .
You're making me go off-key .
Bring down that top sail !
I'll be able to see better from that pine tree over there .
You knew , no one knew , no one knew as well as you did , about my daughter's plans to run away .
Therefore , let every man give some thought to how this noble expedition may be undertaken .
But Hello , my lord , how have you been doing lately ?
Tongue , do not speak .
You wrong me even more , sir , by denying it .
Is she really that wonderful ?
It seems to me like we're still sleeping , still dreaming .
Please , my lord , call her back .
I know you're my oldest brother , and deserve more respect .
Is the army without a leader ?
You represented yourself as just a common man .
Sister , I have a lot to say about things that concern us both .
This contract doesn't give you any blood at all .
Is this servant of yours a smart man ?
Tell me so I can be sure , though I swear I recognize your voice .
Now he denies it a bit , and tries to laugh it off .
Just notice .
I willingly accept your offer and put my future in your hands .
It wasn't the journey itself , uncle , but the troubles we encountered that made it wearisome and dull .
Where is our entertainment director ?
What do you believe ?
But where is he ?
There are no bushes or shrubs to protect me from the weather here .
Here comes his body , mourned by Mark Antony , who , though he had no part in the killing , will benefit from his death , receiving a share in the commonwealth , as you all will .
Why have you collapsed ?
But if you conspired against my position while you were there , I might be interested in the reason for your stay in Egypt .
I'm not staying here to argue anymore .
I can't believe it." The tears fell from her eyes like holy water .
That's the only witchcraft I ever used .
You're afraid of the boar but you go around without your spear ?
Come out , beautiful sun , until I've bought a mirror to admire my reflection in , I'll watch my shadow as I stroll along .
But I have a sinking feeling anyway .
On what grounds ?
Now I'm afraid we've lost your son forever .
And I hope he's studying his music like he's supposed to .
It probably has something to do with, I don't know .
I was wrong to her , Do you know how an oyster makes its shell ?
Oh , it breaks my heart to think how painful it must be for you to recall all this , things that I can't remember .
You keep cramming words into my ears that I don't want to hear .
I hate him so much it makes me sick , and whoever can ruin his happiness will make me happy .
Why , Caesar straddles the narrow world like a giant , and we petty men walk under his huge legs and look forward only to dying dishonorably , as slaves .
Then may your daughters be cursed with all the horrible fates that await sinners !
Give it up and go drink .
His arrival fits perfectly into my plan .
They'll set their watches to whatever time we say .
Pardon my crime , sovereign , but not my person .
Good to see you , Signior Hortensio .
Why ?
I've destroyed my reputation , a most shameful error .
I am not a child or an infant .
No , Messala .
Don't be so quick to twist my meaning .
I can put him in the right mood , and I'll bring him to the Capitol .
But you had better get back to Egypt again .
No , I found it and gave it to my husband .
Otherwise , forgive me , but if you should die before him , what becomes of her dowry ?
Our closest relatives are the ones most likely to murder us .
Pyramus is coming up to the wall .
No , listen to it , Antony .
Shush , sir , please !
Oh , correct it completely .
Spirit , we have to get ready to meet with Caliban .
And what is the subject ?
Noses , ears , lips .
Richard of York , how are you doing , my loving brother ?
Those are her orders .
In that case it's your imagination that's interesting , not the play .
No , you were one of Gneius Pompey's leftovers , not to mention your other , more depraved affairs , which have somehow managed to avoid becoming the subject of vulgar gossip .
Please don't ruin any more trees by carving love poems on their barks .
One of you go call the Jew into court here .
Wait just a minute , you brazen hussy .
By God , I wouldn't lose as much honor as a single man more would cost me , I think , not even if it meant giving up my best hope for victory .
Did you see the gloomy Lord Northumberland ?
But please don't let any of your people wake me up .
I was born in Pisa , famous for its serious citizens , like my father before me ; my father , Vincentio , a successful , world-traveled merchant , was one of the
Wake up , wake up , ring a bell and wake up all the snoring citizens .
At that exact moment , Titania woke up and immediately fell in love with him , an ass .
Since she would love both of you , you two would be joined in that love .
Tie him to this chair. , You'll see , criminal , By the gods , it's disgraceful for you to pull my beard .
Don't you know that I'm a woman ?
It's too bad some mutual friend of theirs doesn't introduce them .
Do that .
The next day I explained all this to him , which was as good as begging his pardon .
But he told me to get lost and threatened to hit me , kick me , even kill me .
The more you beat me , the more I'll love you .
Why are you frowning like that ?
There's nothing of the weak woman left in me .
If you say my wife is beautiful , eats well , loves good company , speaks freely , sings , plays music , and dances well , you're not making me jealous .
Oh , what misery !
In every good thing they do .
This is old Ninny's tomb .
Therefore , my old age is like a blustery winter : cold , but kindly .
When we meet on Judgment Day , that look of yours will send me from heaven to hell , where devils will grab me .
Words before fighting .
Yes , I do .
But what am I afraid of ?
Make these men work .
Most powerful lord , my mistress Cleopatra sent me to you .
Now Margaret's curse has fallen on our heads , for standing by and doing nothing when Richard stabbed her son .
You have broken my heart .
Will you be my husband , then ?
Can you tell me whether Rosalind , Duke Senior's daughter , has also been banished ?
Don't give him time to catch his breath .
That's very true , mangy rascal , when it pleases God .
Well , first of all , my horse is tired and my master and mistress have had a falling out .
Conrade , I say !
You suffered a loss like mine ?
Where are you coming from ?
So you took pleasure in bringing me this message ?
What can I do for you , madam ?
Keep him away from me !
Oh , you wicked scoundrel !
Then you can hear my news , as dessert .
That's what he said .
Snap out of your daze .
Now the inconstant moon has nothing to do with me .
Katherina , you may stay .
I think so .
But listen to me , Gratiano .
Right now I'm away from home and I can't provide you with proper care .
Uncle , please give me your dagger .
Why is my lord enraged against his love ?
Write to him from me , I'll sign it , sending greetings and gentle good-byes .
I hope that's all he loses .
Tomorrow , and then every day after that .
Why do I have to do that ?
And for the sake of those you grieve for , do me a favor : tell me the full story of what has happened to you and them , up to this point .
Your brother is young and inexperienced , and because of my affection for you , I'd hate to crush him , though I'd have to , if he challenged me .
I'll do my best , madam .
Hortensio , have you come to break up the fight ?
There is a man who loves you better than your husband could .
No , before !
So she was moved by it ?
Come on , my dear Greek philosopher .
Don't go , " says my conscience .
Pile of dirt !
Good friends , I thank you all for coming to see me wed this patient , sweet , virtuous wife .
It astounds me that such a weak man could beat the whole world and carry the trophy of victory alone .
We're in God's hands , brother , not in theirs .
What were the primary evils he claimed women were guilty of ?
Open your gates .
The French are still fighting .
And he challenged you to a duel ?
But aren't there some healthy men whom we have to make sick ?
You've only insulted yourself .
Good night to you .
Please let me know your plan , Bassanio .
Pindarus , order our commanders to lead their charges a little ways away from this ground .
How did you learn about this ?
Leonato and his brother .
I remember this fellow , he once played the eldest son of a farmer .
Let's have more sex in the world , since Gloucester's bastard son was kinder to him than my daughters , conceived in lawful wedlock , have been to me .
So , if they die unprepared , the king is no more guilty of their damnation than he was guilty of the earlier crimes they're finally being punished for .
I'll have you whipped with wire and soaked in brine like a pickle , making your pain linger .
The other voice is harsh and abusive .
I'm sick , Charmian .
It's his fault that he's all worked up like this .
He looks calmer than he did before .
Who can command the forest and make the trees pull their roots out of the earth ?
May I speak , Caesar .
What time is it ?
What proof is there ?
Messala , today is my birthday , I was born on this very day .
Yes , Cassius .
Picture the mayor and all his brother citizens dressed in their best as they go forth like senators of ancient Rome to welcome home their conquering Caesar .
Enough .
Stay with us tonight .
Help us , good friends .
Don't simply hide your hatred .
Quiet there !
I'll chop her into pieces .
The "passionate" duke ?
Sir , that would be me and my partner .
Cassius , go to the next street and divide the crowd .
Yes , sir .
To get my poor , mad husband out from inside there .
He's quite simply the smartest working-man in Athens .
But tell me , Egeus .
Do you think I'd break my oath ?
As long as that ?
Choose your revenge .
Is something about to happen that warrants working this night and day ?
Come on .
Tell me .
I'll get there first and tell him what we found out .
You mean a devil !
I don't think you're treating me fairly .
And so you do .
But then I do you wrong to say as much , since you are the very embodiment of bravery .
Oh , what a bloody end to all this !
Is she enclosed in silver , which is ten times less valuable than gold ?
When I was still living with him I heard him swear to Tubal and Cush , his countrymen , that he'd rather have Antonio's flesh than twenty times the sum Antonio owed .
I did .
She knew an old song called "Willow" that reminded her of her own story , and she died singing it .
Strange and terrible events are all welcome , but I despise comforts .
When did I Do you know where you are , sir ?
For God's sake , send somebody else .
But is he often like this ?
Let's listen to the moon .
If there's any good deed I can do that will bring you peace and me honor , speak to me .
The king has bet six Barbary horses , and he has prepared six French rapiers and daggers with all their accessories .
Stinking like a swamp .
Will you be having dinner with her tonight ?
Stop , Demetrius !
Ha , ha , ha !
Oh Scotland , Scotland !
They only like things as bad as themselves .
I'll follow you , my lord .
Come on , let's go see King Edward .
And when the mind is engaged , the rest of the body , dead and dull before , wakes up and comes to life with a new nimbleness and sensitivity , like a snake shedding its dead skin .
It's two o'clock now .
God bless you .
But did you listen to all that poetry without even wondering about what your name is doing on all these trees ?
I'll do it , if you help me out .
If we're like you in everything else , we'll resemble you in that respect .
Divide each man into a thousand , and there you will have an imaginary army .
Is this the king we offered to ransom ?
Iago , I'm leaving my dear Desdemona with you .
You're in a good mood tonight , my lord .
I'll tell them that we won't hurt anyone with our swords , and that Pyramus isn't really dead .
Oh sweet mistress , speak !
I had no reason , no reason .
What would I do besides good ?
Are all the cups and glasses in their places , the tablecloths laid out , everything in order ?
You're in a bad mood ?
That's the right attitude .
Who sent you here ?
You will never fall victim to Benedick's charms , my niece .
It warms my heart to encounter such a country bumpkin .
What did you mean by not helping me ?
Please , sir ; crack jokes over lunch .
Your ghost walks the earth and turns our swords toward our own stomachs .
But his punishment was bitter death .
Me too .
Even the fragile wren , the smallest of birds , will fight against the owl when it threatens her young ones in the nest .
No , don't throw any of it away .
Will you let me ?
If she restrained your rowdy knights , she had such a good reason that you can't blame her for it .
Is Would your Mightiness care to wash his hands ?
Did you see the king today , Lord Derby ?
Turn the ship to the wind !
Hortensio and I have given you up .
I beg your pardon .
The great emperor Caesar , dead and turned to clay , might plug up a hole to keep the wind away .
that mountain of insanity that wants to marry me , I could find it in my heart to stay here and become a witch myself .
Come , mistress Kate , I'll join you .
Well , I'll turn pimp and do some occasional pickpocketing .
Wait , good Beatrice .
Does that necessarily mean you should love his son ?
In the place where souls recline on beds of flowers we'll walk hand in hand and amaze the other ghosts with our spirited demeanor .
My worthy lord , your noble friends miss your company .
Oh , I hate looking at his face now !
Listen to our horses neighing , longing to be working .
I'll disguise myself in somber robes .
His name's Cinna .
Now die , die , die , die , die .
Let's hear someone play the triangle and the sticks .
Look in on me , and talk with me , or I'll attack even without a weapon .
What's the news among the merchants ?
If you won't listen to reason , I'll have to die .
What are you Nothing .
Would I ever deny you anything ?
I have no interest in getting mixed up with the devil .
Yes , and Wall too .
That's all he asks for himself .
Well , that's what the wife brings to the marriage .
Why Dover ?
Oh , that bird from hell !
The testament !
But who is this ?
If they do fight , I hope Lysander is safe !
Is Horatio here too ?
Listen !
How am I unfaithful ?
What would the King of Naples do if he heard you say that ?
My dear Caius , I'll explain the task at hand to you as we walk toward the man we must do it to .
He's a conspirator .
I'm here , sir .
Bottom !
His wildness is a threat to all of us , to you , to me , to everyone .
Oh , Julius Caesar , you are still powerful .
Prepare yourselves .
Well , sir , and you , witty lady , who gave me quite a turn with your strange talk , my name is Vincentio , my hometown Pisa , and I am traveling to Padua to visit a son of mine whom I haven't seen in a long while .
If she refuses my proposal , I'll tell her how much I'm looking forward to the announcement and the wedding .
No , my lord .
What's your name ?
Farewell to you , and you , and you , Volumnius .
But he isn't here now .
Let's embrace
My lord , he just left here .
Now Antony has to leave her completely .
But I still have a little memory left , and there's still some fire in my eyes ; my dull , deaf ears can still hear a little .
I don't like the way he's acting , and it's not safe for me to let his insanity get out of control .
I heard that Julius Caesar got fat from all the feasting there .
Or like a whale .
I told him to come back and talk to me in a bit , and he promised he would .
It carried us toward Corinth-or so we thought .
Oh , it's a disaster , a disaster , by this hand , it's a disaster .
I never gave him any token of romantic love .
Sit down , Jessica .
I'm going to stand so I can see him pass on the way to the Capitol .
If she welcomes him and his hundred knights after I've shown how inappropriately he's behaved , Here , ma'am .
Yes , he was born at Monmouth , Captain Gower .
Cleopatra recognizes your greatness and accepts your authority .
I can see what's in broad daylight .
Now what ?
If I could win a lady by playing leapfrog or vaulting into my saddle with my armor on my back , though you may accuse me of boasting , I could easily get myself a wife .
I know you'd never skip school .
We'd find that he was a dangerous plotter .
Not the time I saw it .
You're less happy , being feared , than they are in fearing you .
To the Forest of Arden , to find your father .
Your descendants will be kings , even though you will not be one .
Margaret , run into the sitting room .
Wait , and listen to me , countrymen .
You're a villain !
Four legs and two voices , a very special monster .
I spoke with some of the sailors who survived the wreck .
There comes an old man with his three sons , It sounds like the beginning of an old folktale .
That's "Ninus's grave , " man .
But how is it possible that Prospero's alive and well and living on this island ?
I see him revive himself to praise my noble act .
Now all my enemies are at my mercy .
Then both my grief and your sorrow will be cured .
I've already had a glass of wine tonight , watered down , but look how drunk I am .
I'm bleeding , but you didn't kill me .
What do I see here ?
Where's Monsieur Cobweb ?
He was in a good mood , and then suddenly he started thinking of Rome .
I'll knock your teeth out , sir .
Bring here The gentleman who advised you To give away your land .
I'm not Stephano , I'm a walking cramp .
You seem all right now .
He who chooses me will get what he deserves." That's nicely put , because who's going to cheat luck and get more than he deserves ?
I know that young men look forward to their rest .
When should the three of us meet again ?
No , come on , one more time .
Oh , wouldn't it be great if property , rank , official positions , and other honors were earned only by merit , not by corruption ?
Let him command me , and I'll do whatever he asks , no matter how violent .
Eat .
I'd rather be anything besides a fool .
The services I have done for the Venetian government will count for more than his complaints will .
My husband !
What a pain .
Say something .
I pitied you , worked hard to teach you to speak , and taught you some new thing practically every hour .
A man old Frederick , your father , loves .
I hope to make the sender blush for it .
Why do you sound so odd ?
You wake up to have fun , and you start work when you go to bed .
Foreign savages who eat their own children for dinner will be as close to my heart as you , ex-daughter of mine .
The king is virtuous and kind .
Look at this man .
And I know that unless the law intervenes , it'll be bad news for poor Antonio .
Usually fathers produce children , not the other way around .
My lord , he asks that you please visit him tomorrow or the next day .
We're wandering in a maze .
You think so ?
Or if you haven't broken away from human company , as my feelings now lead me to do , you haven't loved .
While we were here guarding you as you slept , we heard a loud roar that sounded like bulls , or lions .
God knows I waited for you in anguish , pain , and agony when I gave birth to you .
Look !
You'll be my role model .
Farewell , lady .
My vision is dull .
His attendants are desperate , violent men .
Speak confidently .
If I live long enough to touch you again , that would be as good as having my eyesight back .
Oh , you lowlife !
I'm sending you to England on diplomatic business , and Hamlet will go with you .
What do you mean ?
I knew him when he would've walked ten miles to see a well-crafted suit of armor ; now he spends ten nights awake in his room designing himself a fancy new jacket .
Good night , Lord Brutus .
No one admires speed more than the lazy .
But I'm running ahead of myself .
There go the minstrels .
But stop , I say .
If she's cheated on me , then heaven itself is a fake .
Leave all the rest to me .
Hmm , let me see :
Laertes , I want you to hear what they say .
Light the candles !
Oh , how brave of you !
She's probably right .
A ghost , a ghost !
It's true .
Oh , how awful !
Orlando .
Angels are still bright even though Lucifer , the brightest angel , fell from heaven .
Or was it a blessing that we came here ?
This treachery of yours is like the second
I grow old , and all dignity has been thrashed out of me .
Their hands and faces were all covered with blood .
I've locked it up in my room .
Treat them with honor and dignity .
Oliver , your brother , no , not your brother ; and yet he's the son , but no , I won't call him the son , of that great man I was about to call his father , has heard about how well you did in the wrestling match , and tonight he's planning on burning your house down , with you in it .
What did he say ?
Have you ever cured anyone this way before ?
Come on , you're a fool , and driven to extreme measures by love .
Oh , what a fall it was , my countrymen !
And when will that be ?
I'll go with you , my lord , if you'll allow me .
What do you mean , "wears the wreath" ?
He never did anything in his whole life that looked as good as the way he died .
Now everyone be seated , as this is the part where we sit and chat as well as eat .
Go in , and don't cry .
I'll give you a greater gift than that , nephew .
How will that kill this marriage ?
Where's Antony ?
Yes , look , it's true that children are punished for the sins of their fathers .
Was it a man ?
The king acts unnaturally , father against child .
My lord , Hamlet's going to his mother's room .
She'll fall madly in love with the first thing she sees when she wakes up , even if it's a lion , a bear , a wolf , a bull , a monkey , or an ape .
You'd be a pitiful bird .
If I told you I understood Greek , I'd be lying .
Conscience , " I say , "you give good advice." "Devil , " I say , "you give good advice." If I listened to my conscience , I'd stay with the Jew my master , who's a devil .
Let's not get gloomy in our reminiscing , since there's no reason for sadness anymore .
See you soon .
Yes , I'm sure he will , to stay with you .
There was a time when you'd freely tell me that words were never music to your ear unless I said them , that objects never pleased your eye unless I showed them to you , that touches never pleased your hands unless they were my touches , and that food never tasted sweet to you unless I had prepared it .
Until then , think about the well-being of Rome .
And tell the Dauphin his joke will look pretty stupid when thousands more weep than ever laughed at it .
I ate with him and my sister .
How can they refuse to speak with me ?
Get rid of half your knights and go back to spend the rest of your month with my sister .
And here he comes , puffing himself up like a turkey .
Let's go to the temple first .
Thank you for saying that , your Worship , but we're just the poor duke's officers .
This box was tested in the fire seven times .
Oh , how strange !
And shall our lively blood , quickened by wine , be so frosty ?
Spread the word .
But I'm afraid we'll never get him to agree to be king .
Great Queen Juno is coming .
You have offered me the lands of Sicily and Sardinia .
You can give good news in many ways , but let bad news interpret itself as you tell it .
They see , smell , and taste sweet and sour just like their husbands .
Oh , I'd rather have met my fiercest enemy in heaven , Horatio , than have lived through that terrible day !
You know that he does .
He pretended to be some kind of sorcerer , and he gazed in my eyes and took my pulse .
I mistook you for that sly Venetian woman who married Othello. , You whorehouse-keeper .
As for this ghost we just saw , he's a real one , I can tell you that much .
What did Northumberland say about Richmond ?
The only thing I could do with her is to use all that oil as fuel in a lamp and then use that light to run away by .
Cassio was wrong to hurt Montano , who was only trying to help him , but I'm sure the guy who ran away must have offended Cassio in some terrible way , and Cassio couldn't let it pass .
If you want to go to hell , there are better ways to do it than killing yourself .
What's the reason for this horrible shouting ?
The table's full .
This storm protects me from thoughts that would hurt me more .
How dare you serve it to me this way !
No , because we shouldn't be doing that , stuff .
I won't trouble you so much as to wake you .
I'm your love , no matter what you think .
However , this is an extreme situation , and it's more important to control it than to worry about how you'll look .
He's married to Octavia , madam .
As a matter of fact , if the playwright had played Pyramus and hanged himself with Thisbe's belt , it would have been a very good tragedy .
He hadn't arrived by the time we finished eating , so I went out looking for him .
He's not very tall , but he's tall enough for his age .
By the moon and stars !
I can get you five hundred ropes for that price .
You could have come sooner .
Will you be patient ?
God , I'm crazy about her .
So do you take her or leave her ?
You come from heaven , don't you ?
What then , sick ?
Give me your arm .
You're still here ?
Who's shouting "murder" ?
My husband !
Here , Peter Quince .
To this day , the kings of France follow this unspoken rule , even though they point to this Salic law to bar your Highness from inheriting it through the female line .
Spoken like a gentleman .
Are we bothering you ?
Oh , what a mean low-life I am !
We've driven him all the way back to his camp .
Give me my robe , because I'm going .
Here I am , Theseus .
Listen to me , Beatrice , Talking with a man outside her bedroom window !
I won't hurt him .
This isn't a monster , it's a devil .
Yes , my lord .
When you've finished , go back to Pompey's theater .
What's her skin like ?
That big ship over there looks no bigger
I served Mark Antony , who was the commander most worthy of my services .
Second , he must make a will here in this court that leaves all his property to his son-in-law Lorenzo and his daughter when he dies .
But my daughter should know about this , so she can be prepared with an answer just in case .
And you yourself will determine the sentence as you see fit , and impose the death penalty if you choose to , even if the criminal were my own son .
Give me your hand .
My brother Gloucester's voice ?
It's not true .
You're in your own kingdom , sir .
When I raise my hand , you do the same , and bring it down on Gonzalo's head .
Me too , my lord .
Quiet !
That's when you gave them the spanking paddle and pulled your pants down , Please , uncle , hire a teacher who can teach your fool to lie .
Let it be a quarrel between us , if you live .
I don't feel any urge to see a more handsome man than this one .
Your words and actions don't match up .
Here's a goat for you .
Oh , Pyramus , get up !
Soon all my work will be done , and you'll be free .
Hurry up .
Your English sorrows will make me smile in France .
She's the one who's got to do it .
My letters say only seventy senators were killed , one being Cicero .
What do you think , girl !
Come here , Sir Seacole .
Make me believe it ?
I could even supply the dialogue between you and your lover if you did your little puppet show of love for me .
Why do you want to do that , my lord ?
No ?
How about the mustard without the beef .
If you'll take a simple man's advice , don't be here when it arrives .
Oh , the things men dare to do !
I'm already here , sir .
I hope we've corrected that fault pretty well in our company , sir .
He's walking ahead of me , and he keeps daring me to follow him .
I'm afraid his mother may have had an affair with a blacksmith .
Good , sir ?
I'm hoping for better .
Do you know him ?
Young Fortinbras , returning in triumph from Poland , is firing his guns to greet the English ambassadors .
The cold wind's still blowing through the hawthorn tree .
Have you heard anything to the contrary ?
No .
Which one of them should I pick ?
If I had known this young man was his son , I would have tried harder to convince him not to fight .
Are you Tyrrel ?
If she'd been faithful to me , I never would have given her up , not even if God himself offered me a jewel as big as a planet in exchange for her .
Macbeth !
How is my lord ?
Then the liars are fools , for there are enough liars in the world to beat up the honest men and hang them .
The best plays are still only illusions , and the worst are just as good , if you just use your imagination to fill them in .
Cassio was attacked here in the dark by Roderigo and men who escaped .
Go to Francis Seacole , the constable of the watch .
Well , in and of itself , it is a good life , but given that it's a shepherd's life , it's worthless .
Nobody ever set a gem like her in a worse setting than gold .
She blushes from guilt , not modesty .
It's pathetic to be Caesar .
But before they reached us-let me say no more !
Royal seductress !
Tell him I am ready to lay my crown at his feet and kneel before him .
Your sister's sister .
I'll be nearby to help you , and between the two of us we can handle him .
I'd try it , if I could cry "hem" and have him .
Come on , tie them up .
In bed with her ?
Unless your taunts can undo the signature on my contract , you're just wearing out your lungs by speaking so loud .
Tell me , good grandmother , is our father dead ?
Now , Catesby , what does your lord say to my request ?
Believe me , then , that I have special powers .
If she gave you as much lip as she gives me , you'd be sick of her by now .
But let me see , by ten we shall each have captured a hundred Englishmen .
I wish I knew what was in your heart .
You hear the charges .
She was filthy !
So , there's the signal to ride .
Maybe I should ask you what right you have to take me , but I'll take you , Orlando , to be my husband .
Did he tell Macduff to return to Scotland ?
I was a reasonable man , then I became a fool , and finally a beast !
If it's work for a man , I'll do it .
He and I will make up .
I'll put her on that .
Here ,
What's the matter ?
Gentleman , I am not the same man I was before .
Well , no , not literally .
But where will we go ?
Listen , Fairy King .
As for my daughter Katherine , this much I know : she's not for you , more's the pity .
I sincerely hope it does you good , mangy rascal .
That's enough .
In saving you I consider myself well paid .
Charmian , did I ever love Caesar as much as this ?
The jewels you took from me to deliver to Desdemona would've made even a nun want to sleep with me .
How tall is she ?
The man should be inside the lantern .
Is it true , sir , that the Duke of Cornwall was killed as they say ?
So I guess it's you , you silver treasure house .
Let it all go .
Don't speak of this again .
Welcome , destruction , blood , and massacre !
What did you do that for ?
Tell the Duke of Albany to prepare for war immediately .
Caesar .
I'll tell twenty lies like that , so men will think I graduated from school at least a year ago .
Amen to that , from the bottom of my heart .
Indeed , I would have such an exploit for you , Ligarius , if you were healthy enough to hear it .
Halfway down the cliff there's somebody clinging to the rock and gathering wild herbs , a risky business !
Not young enough to fall in love with a woman because she sings well , but not old enough to dote on a woman for any reason .
I'm completely lost .
You're a good judge of horsemanship .
Did you give everything to your two daughters and end up like this ?
He almost begs for the opportunity to help you .
He's lying through his teeth !
I need proof !
This chatter is no cure for my toothache .
Great Mark Antony is a widower now .
But brother , I have some strange news for you .
But who was that man ?
Let any man perish who isn't ready now !
Get out of here .
Madam !
We've been looking for him everywhere .
Or did you agree to this as equals ?
But I'll go in .
A sculptor or a painter couldn't have screwed him up as bad as that , even as an apprentice .
Here I am .
I have no personal reason to strike at him , only the best interest of the people .
Until then , God be with you !
All these new Christians will make the price of hogs go up .
You will be exhibited in Rome along with me , like Egyptian puppets .
Please keep in mind we're only here out of spite .
Oh , lying woman !
My learned lord , kindly explain to us the legal and religious grounds for why this French Salic law either should or shouldn't bar me in my claim .
Three or four women near me cried , "Alas , good soul ! " and forgave him with all their hearts .
Keep your promise , my love .
No , I have a commitment .
He's awfully proud , but his pride suits him .
I am not treacherous .
I'll stop your mouth with a kiss .
In a fit of rage she locked you up in a hollow pine tree , with the help of her powerful assistants , and left you there for twelve years .
That's enough about that .
Authority .
That was a fine fanfare , boys .
Sir , a word before you go .
Now I'll get Cassio to do something in front of all these drunkards that will offend everyone on the island .
What's going on here ?
What's the news with you ?
Who's that ?
I think you're more articulate .
You have absolutely abused our sex in this love talk of yours .
Yes , and be brief .
If you mutiny against me , I'll hang you from the next tree .
We're very sorry , sir , that you may not live to wear us out with your commands .
Again , good night , kind lords and gentlemen .
No , a flatterer wouldn't , even if the faults were as huge as Mount Olympus .
The count is neither sad nor sick nor cheerful nor well , he's just civil , as Seville as an orange , with the same jealous-yellow complexion .
So be it , Dolabella .
All cooped up together , just as you ordered , all imprisoned in the grove of linden trees that protects your room from bad weather .
Yes , the state's half can be reduced , but not Antonio's .
I feel my stomach squeezing up against my heart .
How are you doing , Charles ?
The king won't live , I hope .
Listen to me .
Stop .
You agree now that we're not imagining this , don't you ?
Okay , bring on the play .
You all know this cloak .
Your horn is a foot long , and I'm at least that size .
What sickness did she die of ?
I hope you're strong enough to do it .
If I'm not mistaken , that's Portia's voice .
Soldier , why are you wearing that glove in your cap ?
Madam , you've given me life and given me a living too .
Cassio can have my job .
It was the most ruthless massacre this country has ever been guilty of .
Go inside yourself .
Oh God , Iago , what can I do to win my husband back again ?
He's going senile .
If God will be revenged for this deed , he will do it publicly .
This treacherous Egyptian has betrayed me .
I've lost so much weight worrying about my losses have that I'll hardly have a pound of flesh to spare for my bloody creditor tomorrow. , Well , jailer , let's go. , I hope to God that Bassanio comes to see me pay his debt .
Indeed , you would be out if I were your mistress , if my chastity is worth as much as my wit .
Look in the almanac .
I tricked your own eyes .
Invoke his warlike spirit and that of Edward the Black Prince , your great-uncle , who fought a tragic battle on French soil , routing the French army in full force while his mighty father stood by on a hilltop , smiling to see his son steeped in the blood of French noblemen .
What are you doing here ?
If you like , you can rest a while in my room .
Not one , my lord .
Today shall always be remembered as a holy day .
Did we , my lord ?
Did he lose his other eye ?
Come , sisters , let's cheer him up and show him our talents .
Speak .
Are these our eyes ?
Why are you so sad ?
The two of them were separated during the storm .
I never saw the necklace , so help me heaven !
I wish I knew what is happening .
know myself !
He's lost his comrades and is wandering around looking for them .
Goodbye , sir .
It means being filled with fantasy ; with passion and wishes ; with adoration , loyalty , and devotion .
Good idea .
Oh , now you weep , and I sense that you feel pity .
It was two o'clock when I left him , and now it's one .
Procreation is a good thing , but if your daughter gets pregnant , look out , friend .
What's that trumpet ?
God bless the island of Cyprus and our noble general Othello !
And I am Brutus , Marcus Brutus .
Don't go near Casca .
No , I'm begging you now , tell me who it is .
If you have tears , prepare to shed them now .
He has the wisdom to act bravely but also safely .
Don't you know , master , that some men's best qualities do them in ?
Come on , get ready .
Don't say that , my lord .
You're a well-dressed lady .
What a painful condition responsibility is .
I am a villain .
Well , other men have bad luck too .
How horrible !
That upsets me much more than getting wet .
Come , let's go .
But let her live .
Follow it , follow it !
Whatever you see first when you wake up , think of it as your true love .
Has he , sirs ?
Ah well , my Kate .
Once I've put my rackets to these balls , I'll play a set in France , God willing , that will knock his father's crown right out of the court .
It's obvious .
Nothing but "little" and "short" ! , Why are you letting her insult me like this ?
I'll never believe any of these old legends or fairy tales .
What is this passion that ties up my tongue ?
Okay , but when ?
If there's enough wind for a ship to sail out tonight , I won't spend tonight in this town .
My lord , I don't think I cried out .
Dear master , listen to me .
There is no better one on earth .
But not a member of the royal family , like me .
It's almost morning , but I'm sure you're not fully satisfied about what happened .
Not much .
Here's to you !
And I saw her do it .
I will not rise until your Highness hears me .
Good-bye .
Why , sir , he's not coming .
Yours , if we're talking about I'm leaving .
Good day and happiness to you , darling Rosalind .
That since she's mad herself , she's married a madman .
Until now , no one could say that only one man mattered in all of vast Rome .
Consider it done , my lord .
And so she turns men inside out and never acknowledges the integrity and merit that a man has .
Yes .
Didn't I tell you she was innocent ?
A daughter ?
She'll confirm everything .
I'm not in a joking mood .
But listen , Charmian .
Is he crazy with love for you ?
God bless you , sir .
Gloucester , it's true that we are in great danger .
down , and then say also that in Aleppo I once saw a Turk beating a Venetian , so I grabbed the Turk by the throat and hit him like this .
Yes , be content , good Touchstone .
Yes , ma'am .
Shake off your sleepiness .
She said she loved me for the dangers I'd survived , and I loved her for feeling such strong emotions about me .
There was no end to his generosity .
A sleeve ?
Ha !
No one has ever faked passion as skillfully as this , then .
Oh Setebos , these are handsome spirits !
My name is Thidias .
Set the honorable old man down and let him eat .
He discovered that the man was his older brother .
It's new to you .
I don't know .
Let them marry your children !
My wife's coming .
What do you mean by "furniture" ?
Who were you chasing with your sword ?
Well , it's a fault I wouldn't trade for your best virtue .
I can see you don't like this gentleman .
You're shaking with emotion .
Why "puppet" ? , Oh , I see where this is going .
Let that be enough for you .
Listen !
Yes , that the king is dead .
I can't stand her .
I think that Macedon is indeed where Alexander was born .
Do it immediately , or all your previous services to me were accidental , without purpose .
If that were true , then I'd know your secret .
Welcome .
Go , and hurry back to bring us her reply and news of her state of mind .
No , it hasn't , my lord .
Wake up !
Take him to my sleeping area .
If there were anything inside their heads , they could never wear such heavy helmets .
Soon enough .
Brutus , my country's friend .
Oh , not you again .
Those are the things we pine for now .
I doubt it .
Is this possible ?
Yes , my lord .
I know the man well .
But your words are as sweet as honey , you've stolen from the bees and left them with nothing .
I told him to knock at your gate and for the life of me could not get him to do it .
Help !
Bassanio gave his ring to the judge who asked for it , and deserved it too .
We shouldn't expect men to be perfect , or for them to be as polite as on the weddingday .
But where will I lie tomorrow ?
Stop right there !
The sailors are all below deck , sleeping both from their labor and from a magic spell I cast over them .
There's certainly not a boy left alive , and it was done by the cowardly rascals who were running from the battle .
How did this happen ?
You're on your deathbed .
He used to lend money as a favor between Christians ; but now , let him think about his own debt .
Yes , as short as a woman's love .
Age is the thing that nourishes .
Certainly , your grandmother had a worse match .
I would have my own brother arrested if he treated me so terribly .
Truly , lady , you have a merry heart .
Oh sir , I accept .
I'll warm myself by blowing on the fire .
I'm coming , my lord .
Speak , if you can .
Give me your arm .
Why does he talk like that to a girl he can't stand ?
person when you're ready , if you're inclined .
She told my mother that as long as she kept it with her , my father would love and desire her .
My songbird , we have beaten them to their beds .
You'll both help me , right ?
And I love Hastings with all my heart .
Your crown is crooked .
What color , madam ?
And what did he say ?
We're wasting time here .
That's the way of the world .
Besides that , he says that two meetings are going to be held tomorrow , and something may be decided at one of them that may make you and him , who are at the other , sorry .
Who do you want to work for ?
I'll do it , sir .
Have them click their heels together and don't dare touch a hair of the master's horse's tail till they kiss their hands .
No , lady .
How ?
Even someone with a good and virtuous nature might give way to a royal command .
You are welcome , sir .
Take your seat .
It was the play in which you wooed the gentlewoman so successfully .
It's called the evil .
Why so pale , my friend ?
I wasn't invited because they like me .
I'm afraid my Thisbe has forgotten her promise ! , And you , oh Wall , oh sweet , oh lovely Wall , you stand between her father's property and mine , you Wall , oh Wall , oh sweet and lovely Wall .
Yes , I do .
It must go like this .
Besides , there's no king , however pure his cause , who , if it comes to a trial by combat , can rely on using completely blameless soldiers .
Oh , except for the widow Dido ?
It's true .
Prove that the men you call your fathers did truly conceive you .
Why , Fool ?
Yes , that's the one .
What a horrible slut !
I'll be bitter toward him , and curt .
You know that I gave it to you a half hour ago .
You got to me first .
How are you doing , Cassio ? , Someone bring me a stretcher !
The royal tree has left us other fruit , which , with time , will do just fine on the throne and make us all happy as king , I'm sure .
I probably am too young for you .
But prepare yourself for some unpleasantness .
If I know nothing about pity , that must mean I'm not an animal .
Good night .
I'm sorry , you were saying ?
Give us answers .
Hurry !
This is the fool who lent out money without charging interest .
I know she is a hateful , brawling scold .
Aren't the mayor and his fellow citizens coming ?
This is how they do it , sir : they measure the depth of the Nile , according to certain marks made on the walls of the Pyramid .
Go to your cabins and be quiet !
It's not fair to punish me for something you make me do .
Join your witchcraft with your beauty , and let Antony's lust combine with both .
Amen !
Sir , is everyone in your family at home ?
That useless old man still thinks he can wield all the powers he's given away .
To tell you the truth , I was just going to your house .
Tell them to capture me , then sell my bones .
Find a time to speak with Don Pedro and Claudio alone .
The whole world is a stage , and all the men and women merely actors .
I want more uncles here to welcome me .
Someone who can ride fast , go to the duke of Here , my good lord .
So , may the gods protect you and change the hearts of the Romans so that they turn and give you their support .
Right on cue .
And don't be suspicious of me , noble Brutus .
Imagine , when we talk of horses , that you see them planting their proud hooves in the soft earth .
Can't you see for yourself ?
Farewell .
There's a time for all things .
What ?
Whenever you want , since you're the one who wants it .
Where is the villain , Edmund ?
Good words are better than bad strokes , Octavius .
I'll go with you .
Good thinking .
Your praise has beaten you home .
She was your boot-wearing mistress and your warrior lover , and now that she's getting married to Theseus , you've come to celebrate their marriage .
See the wound that Casca made .
If you aren't immortal , watch those around you .
Most noble Antony ! " Then , as she was speaking your name , a strangled groan split her words .
When you've finished , you'll be a happy man .
What are you doing here in Elsinore ?
I've got my answer .
Where is my lord , the duke of Gloucester ?
Really , I'll help .
If you're a virgin , you'll answer this question .
Let me borrow a mirror .
My father's spirit is growing in me , and I won't take this any longer .
Let's go up to the castle .
Listen to him talk about war , and you'll hear elegant and thrilling accounts of the battles .
The devil sings like a nightingale to haunt Poor Tom .
No , no , no , no !
Has it been decided that Richard will be It's been decided , though not yet officially announced .
Oh , it's as easy as lying .
Short but still tedious ?
This is beyond words and beyond belief !
She herself is as valuable as any dowry could ever be .
Thanks , Rosencrantz and worthy Guildenstern .
Oh , I'm dying of hunger .
I'm not going to be bothered by you for long .
She would hang on to him , and the more she was with him the more she wanted to be with him ; she couldn't get enough of him .
Her worth is carried on the wind And it blows throughout the world , carrying the name of Rosalind .
That's not fair .
I say a devil .
That way we can conceal how many of us there are , and Macbeth's spies will give him inaccurate reports .
Wake up the moon goddess with a hymn !
You were supposed to be proving that there isn't time for everything .
So now Sweno , the Norwegian king , wants a treaty .
Then you told a lie , a sick , wicked lie .
It has no fighting spirit .
If we walk on the well-worn paths , they won't get caught in our petticoats .
I'll take you to a place where you can speak freely .
Let him run far away .
What do you mean , lady ?
Are these the wretches that we threw dice for ?
Come to think of it , I thought I felt a scab there .
Goodbye , Edmund .
My master is being difficult .
Unfaithful , my lord ?
Congratulations , lady : you resemble a most honorable man .
Think of your sins .
A What's going on ?
Your voice is loud and commanding , but you look like a working man .
Who are you , slave ?
Are you wise ?
Oh wise judge !
The king's son , Ferdinand , with his hair standing straight up , it looked like reeds , not hair , was the first person to jump , shouting , "Hell is empty , and all the devils are here ! " Good job !
There's magic in its fabric .
Let me shake your hand .
It's dangerous to talk about it .
Gentlemen , welcome to Elsinore .
If everyone looked so lovely in their sorrow , then sorrow would be highly prized .
Farewell , then , Signior Lucentio .
Yes , it is .
Right on cue , here's the duke himself .
Wasn't he friends with all those brawling knights who serve my father ?
Meanwhile , we're the ones who need you .
Would you rather that Caesar were living and we would all go to our graves as slaves , or that Caesar were dead and we all lived as free men ?
Keep your word .
Good day , Lieutenant Bardolph .
God save the king !
No , Caesar doesn't have epilepsy .
Go !
There's still a bit of daylight in the sky .
You must be the one who laughs when boys or women tell you their dreams .
But really , are you the one who's been hanging on the trees those poems that speak so admiringly of Rosalind ?
You don't want to eat , sir ?
I don't know what to say .
I hope we have the time some day !
Oh , sir , impetuous people learn their lessons from the consequences of their foolish actions .
Have all your conquests , glories , triumphs , achievements , come to so little ?
I am a man again .
Dearest , kindest , most honorable sir , may I say , with your esteemed approval , which is lit up by the illuminating radiance of the sun-god Phoebus , that , What do you mean by that ?
You're a spirit , I know .
It's a job meant for a man , but not you .
And all my children ?
Did you notice ?
I dreamed the souls of the people Richard murdered came to my tent and promised me victory .
Very true .
That's what I want you to tell me .
But I'll linger .
Give my love to my kind husband .
But I see you're troubled .
I lent my body once to make him rich .
My dear lord , if it was you who conquered her and took her virginity , I know what you're about to say .
I'll leave now , to set all these things right .
I can only walk a little way with you , since I'm waiting here .
If every time you wished for a child you could have had one , you would have a million children .
But you'll see that the very thing that joins them will be the thing that separates them .
We have to get out of here , old man .
His majesty is so concerned about my personal safety that he has ordered them to conduct me to the You're being arrested ?
If they'll do neither , we'll come to them and make them fly like stones shot from powerful slings .
He turned away twice and almost left him there .
My friends , listen .
In this letter you'll find details of her illness and other , more serious matters that concern you .
I'll kiss your hand , and with that I leave you .
Your mistress sent for me to come to dinner ?
Now get out of here !
You're wise !
Definitely not .
Order them to escape .
I've acted like such a villain !
What are you saying ?
Shall I tell Caesar what you request from him ?
I'd second your wish if it automatically meant that Lucentio could have Baptista's youngest daughter .
Let's discuss it some more .
He is a subject for a king to contemplate , and for a king's king to ride on , and for the world at large , both friend and stranger , to stop whatever they are doing and marvel at .
Goodbye , my lord .
He carries a third of the world .
At his best he's a little less than a man , and at his worst he's little more than an animal .
The queen drinks to your good luck and happiness , Hamlet .
I'm amazed how similar you and your daughters are .
Of course the Prince wants Hero for himself .
I'll torture him .
Denmark's a prison .
No one here is affected by your curse , because curses are just words with no power .
Why should people like me be crawling around between earth and heaven ?
It's no use !
No , the whole day , and all night too .
Don't you know me still ?
C'mon , I might as well say the fool's the fool !
I have money in my purse and property at home , so I'm off to see the world .
What do you want ?
Well , sir , I'll take you to Lear and have you stay with him a while .
No ?
Because , you know , Pyramus and Thisbe meet by moonlight .
Go to the gate .
Do you know why the nose is in the middle of a person's face ?
I should have known it .
Every hour he comes out with some horrible new offense that puts us all on edge .
Listen , please , give me the necklace .
Where will we meet in the morning ?
I'm sure Lorenzo isn't on their ship .
Come on , music !
I'm sorry I hit you .
I have half a mind to hit you before you speak again .
Tell the king what was happening in the battle when you left it .
Are you going to take care of this thing now ?
Your guardian angel is noble , courageous , significant , and unmatched when Caesar's not around .
Yes , I forgot , three months .
Call me when it's lit .
Read the will !
He's fine and healthy , madam .
I must go in .
Sir , don't even try to beat me in a battle of wits .
Come here , Proculeius .
I wish you'd be patient .
Your name's Gloucester .
Welcome , my friends .
Oh , wine is the devil !
I've fought my way through obstacles twenty times more terrifying than you with this weapon .
Good luck , fair gentleman .
I pray that God will let me learn from women like that , not to follow their bad example , but to avoid it !
You're a hardworking villain who'd do anything his evil mistress wanted him to .
My fortune , like that of many of us tonight , is to go drunk to bed .
At this very minute an old black ram is having sex with your little white lamb .
When he opens his wallet to give us our pay , your conscience will fly out ?
Is your master awake ?
I'd rather be a peddler .
Oh Cassio , Cassio , Cassio !
My beautiful queen , we'll go up the mountain and listen to the hounds as their barking echoes in the cliffs and sounds like music .
He'll run after her .
Let me destroy myself , let heaven and destiny deprive me of happy hours , let day remain dark and night sleepless , and let me have nothing but terrible luck if I do not love with a pure heart , clean devotion , and holy thoughts your beautiful royal daughter .
My dearest relative , I'm begging you , pull yourself together .
For my part , I really don't care .
Then both , or one , or anything you like .
Ratcliffe , come here .
Then follow me and listen to my speech , friends .
Unless I've mistaken his battle flags , which I'm sure I haven't , his regiment lies at least half a mile south of the king's mighty army .
How I wish you felt better !
You think I'm kidding .
Good-bye , until you return tonight .
God , not our strength , be praised !
I must and will have Katherine for my wife .
I'm afraid you've sold your own land to see other men's .
Why do you ask ?
I'll look over the inscriptions again .
That's what makes it "sensitive" news .
True , he has an excellent reputation .
Laugh at the power of other men , because nobody born from a woman will ever harm Macbeth .
Trinculo , watch out .
What woman's servant ?
Were you born here ?
Unfortunately , I love myself .
Come , come , hurry up .
Signior Baptista , I'm actually in a bit of a hurry .
You're a cobbler , are you ?
In fact , every imprisoned man holds in his own hand the tool to free himself .
Wipe your eyes .
Well , then , you don't have the affection that would teach you that you and I are one .
I'd risk my soul for that .
And I have much less to comfort me than you do , since I've lost my daughter .
And I feel that I love her .
What do you wish ?
It was wild insanity to believe promises made by the mouth and not the heart .
Help us carry these clothes to where my barrel of wine is hidden , or I'll kick you out of my kingdom .
Twenty crowns ?
What's the matter , lady ?
Take some men and horses and go to her .
Did this happen before the King of France returned home ?
But I'm old now , and suffering has weakened me .
After you .
For instance , our husbands
But I won't attack a woman , even if she is a demon .
I put it in the pocket of my nightgown .
What , I'm a prisoner ?
Not yet." Well , the time has come .
Is the visor of my helmet working better now ?
He begs you to spare his life .
My love , call him back in here .
Then why be jealous of a person like that ?
Indeed you did , and more besides , Miranda .
He has distinguished himself as a great soldier in his own right , deserving more than any honor your can bestow on him .
Edward Plantagenet , why are you dead ?
Tell me what you did with the king's ship , the sailors , and the other ships .
Are you the slave who , with your slanderous words , killed my innocent child ?
She only appears honorable from the outside .
What , from myself ?
If wolves had been howling outside your gate at the heart of that storm , you would've told your doorman to let them in , despite all the cruelties you inflict on the world .
Men tend to be at their most irresponsible when they're away from home .
We've got to give them and take them , my lord .
I'm sorry to find you like this .
What are you going to do ?
This is Caesar you're looking at .
I'm not marvelous , sir , but I'm certainly a maiden .
I've seen both of you fence .
Have mercy , Jesus ! , Wait , I was only dreaming .
I'll read it to you .
My master is standing out in the street !
The last time I was in Exeter , the mayor kindly showed me the castle there and called it " My lord !
That's why the King of France listened to my pleas and tears .
I wish your loyalty were as foolish .
Time ambles for both men .
Oh , that's very nice !
Their messengers are ready , waiting to deliver our response in these matters .
Do you even get what I'm saying ?
Then please , put off your eating for a little while I , like a mother doe , find my fawn and bring it food .
I look forward to that present .
Do you have desires ?
The gown was made just as my master was directed .
She is not sick , my lord , but she is troubled with endless visions that keep her from sleeping .
There were enough Christians before , as many of them as could stand to live near each other .
Oh , you If you want to praise Caesar , just say his name , that's all the praise that's necessary .
Honestly , it's not as good as the other one , and I'm sure your cousin will agree with me .
Yes , do that .
Do you honestly think , tell me , Emilia , there are women who'd cheat on their husbands in such a disgusting manner ?
Don't tempt me to suicide again .
And those eyes were endowed with sight by Claudio , the Prince , and me .
Lady !
While he was still in Rome , he deployed his forces in so many different disguises that all our spies were fooled .
I will have it all mine .
So let me be brief here .
I like the morning .
Is she as fiery a shrew as they say ?
Are you satisfied , Jew ?
Some men don't like roast pig , others go crazy if they see a cat , and others can't help urinating when they hear bagpipes .
Let's do that .
Have patience and endure .
Better to have an extra servant on hand than be understaffed .
Do that , my friend .
Find him and tell him to come here .
Oh , so you'd give me all your tediousness ?
His position is hopeless .
I don't want to take another man's second-hand goods .
Well then , God forgive me !
Leave me quickly .
Please , come to his house with me .
Look , let's stay here tonight .
Do you mean to say that the duke has abandoned the glamorous court to live as a monk ?
But if you believe everything they say , you won't be saved by half of what they do .
Murder !
Good madam , restrain yourself .
You can't tell a story simply when it's a lie .
I think it was a year ago that I told you how much Margaret , Hero's servant woman , likes me .
If we meet again , then we'll smile indeed .
Then , if you dare to acknowledge it , I'll take up my quarrel with you .
Alas , you don't know .
God save your Majesty .
The sound is going away .
We argued about which was best , and now we won't get either one .
But she loves it so much ( since Othello told her she should always keep it with her ) that she always keeps it near her to kiss it and talk to it .
Stand close together , in case someone loyal to Caesar tries to , Don't talk about standing together. , Publius , cheer up .
In order to make your company even more enjoyable , I'm going to keep to myself until suppertime .
Oh , mighty Caesar !
You force me to read the will , then ?
He is .
And here's another poem , which I stole from my cousin's pocket , in her handwriting and all about her adoration for Benedick .
Since I'm suddenly all the rage , it will be worth the cost .
The forests , the skies , the mountains , everything around us seemed to echo the barks of the hounds .
Me too , but still , for the sake of good manners , I'll say thanks for your company .
Tell me .
Can she give that away too ?
All that glitters is not gold , You've often heard that said .
I'm sure you and my husband will be as friendly as you were before .
You're coming here yourself to see the dreaded act you had tried to stop .
But , really , what's going on , Clarence ?
But please , tell me : is he coming home ?
What woman wouldn't be distressed , being lorded over by a handful of dust ?
This isn't a good moment for jokes , save them till a happier time .
It wants you to go off with it , as if it wants to tell you something alone .
No , no .
I'd rather have a jester to make me happy than experience to make me sad , and to travel for all that trouble , no less !
Look : Benedick is so pale , are you sick , or angry ?
For the sake of your father's memory , make peace .

Yeah , right , go get him .
It will give you some protection from this storm .
Hey !
Well , that turned out well in the end .
Rosalind , I have to leave you for two hours .
I'm coming , slut !
The king isn't the one sending you to the Tower , Clarence .
Tell her to come here .
On the platform where we stand guard , sir .
What , here in the middle of the street ?
Where are you from ?
You'll remain a prisoner until we bring your crimes to the Venetian government. , Okay , take him away .
I remember the first time Caesar ever put it on .
Yes , sir .
You didn't arrive like Caesar's sister .
And you haven't heard any news about her in your letters ?
In the end I left them standing in the smelly pond behind your room , with the stinking water covering them up to their chins .
Oh , poor shepherd !
He's dead and rotting in the dirt now .
Lead them inside .
Go lodge a complaint about this with the duke .
The alcohol that got the servants drunk has made me bold .
Oh righteous God , how can I thank you enough that this meat-eating mutt preys on his mother's children and forces her to join others in their grief !
And I will spend our time apart on my knees , praying for you .
What does Caesar want ?
It's , But he's drowned , and these guys are devils .
Early in the morning we'll both rush to Belmont .
I wish your Highness knew my true feelings in this matter : I have never in my life loved my brother .
Dying , sleeping , that's all dying is , a sleep that ends all the heartache and shocks that life on earth gives us , that's an achievement to wish for .
It's proper that we speak first , which is why we sent our proposals ahead of us for your consideration .
Come , blade , drench my breast with blood .
Meet me at the synagogue .
Well , we'll see how you act .
This is the way to trick gullible fools .
That's enough for me , then .
I'll give Thank you , darling .
Is this the Prince's brother ?
I could do more to help Antony , but to do so would insult him .
Charles , I thank you for your loyalty to me , and you'll see that I'll reward you .
You know me too well .
He will be given safe conduct and money for his passage home .
To hell with you !
If you're not having sex with Desdemona tomorrow night , then I suggest you find some way to stab me in the back and kill me .
I'll give you letters of introduction to some friends of mine who will help you .
Not from crying .
Well .
I'm hoping my holy mood will pass .
I could go around the world in forty minutes .
Come , firebrands , over here !
I'm Christopher Sly .
Lights , lights , get us some lights !
Won't he join us ?
Good-bye , my dearest sister , good-bye .
I'm my own spokesman .
Yes , I swear .
There I'll see only myself .
She sent Dromio to bring you home for lunch .
Let's drink through midnight .
It looks like these witches are scared of swords .
Well , Oswald ?
Therefore , depart , and leave him here with me .
Your mother was extremely virtuous , and she said you were my daughter .
I'll cure you of your insolence , and I'm not going to give you a thousand crowns , either ! , Hey , Dennis !
Heaven wanted Rosalind to have these gifts And me to live and die as her slave .
Why , what have you done , sweet Beatrice ?
Send for him , dear uncle .
Your love's name is Rosalind ?
Gentlemen , I don't know what you intend to do , who else you intend to kill , who else you consider corrupt .
Let's move again , my friends .
Let him come in .
No , he means you'll use makeup when you're old .
I feel sorry for you .
His eyes were as green as leeks .
It doesn't matter .
Charmian !
Maybe it's a parade to welcome us to town , master .
And that's why he went crazy .
Am I a coward ?
And why are you noble , strong , and brave ?
Don't worry , sir .
Nothing , good sir , except to help Sir Cobweb scratch my head .
Exactly .
But just be patient until we've calmed the masses , who are beside themselves with fear .
Take out your sword and come on .
Then have your servants bring him out .
It'll be lunchtime within an hour .
Here's why : it'd be better for the enemy to come after us .
No , my cousin , don't wish that even one man who is now in England were here instead .
If you weren't a man , then what kind of animal were you when you first told me you wanted to do this ?
Are you my son ?
Informed them" ?
Don't be afraid .
Don't miss our feast .
I think it's my bad eyesight that's making me see this horrible vision .
I'm Launcelot , who was your boy , is your son , and will be your child .
Those of you who are young and active , I beg you to follow them and keep them from doing the crazy things their guilt might push them to do .
He is worth more mourning than that , and I will mourn for him .
Where's your master ?
I'm putting myself in God's hands , and with his help I plan to fight against the secret plot that caused this treasonous murder .
Thieves !
So now everyone will point at me and say , "Look , there goes the wife of that comedian Petruchio , if he could be bothered to marry the pathetic thing ! "
What do you think of his neighbor , the Scottish lord ?
Come on , don't quarrel with us , good old man .
O Phoebe , Phoebe , Phoebe !
In any case , our survival depends on putting together the strongest force possible .
I will .
And look , here's Publius , come to fetch me .
As for your husband , he is noble , wise , and judicious , and he understands what the times require .
As you can see , these lovers are looking for a place to fight .
Yes , and his relative , too .
I haven't spoken to him since I sent him away from the marketplace earlier .
Not me .
Prepare yourself , please , for this trip .
You've pretended to be in love with her , singing fake love songs softly at her window by moonlight , and you've captured her imagination by giving her locks of your hair , rings , toys , trinkets , knickknacks , little presents , flowers , and candies , things that can really influence an impressionable young person .
I'll bet my life that he only wrote this letter to gauge my love for you , and for no other reason .
It's midnight .
Tell our top commanders that I want tomorrow's battle to be the last we fight .
I'm not moving an inch , pal .
So then the Poles won't be willing to defend it .
Can you buy them with money ?
And how was that one settled ?
I think he's nervous , he's about to become the savage bull who got domesticated .
Should we now dirty our fingers with lowly bribes and sell the mighty offices that we hold for whatever money we can get our hands on ?
Goodbye , goodbye .
Look , here she comes , with your ungovernable wives in tow , like prisoners of her womanly persuasion. , Katherine , that cap of yours doesn't look good on you .
But I wish I could say that's the last time he'll do it !
Calm down , Smulkin , you fiend !
Swords don't frighten me .
Master , I'm all tied up for you .
I have to do these things before I have a chance to think about them .
Both fencers are bleeding , how do you feel , my lord ?
Halt .
Do you want my true opinion ?
My cousin's a fool , and you are too .
Thank you for asking , uncle .
I'm sure he's been kidnapped .
This is It is , my lord .
Just as you'd like to have your sins forgiven , Indulge me , forgive me , and set me free .
Okay , just do this , noble Catesby : sound out Lord Hastings , but make it seem as if you're just mulling over the idea , that it hasn't been firmed up yet .
Will I hear from you soon ?
Dear gods in heaven , what's the reason for this ?
A basting .
Your fall has left a blot that opens even the best and brightest to suspicion .
Can we do that ?
And don't lie .
By my faith in love , I will , then .
The poor people died .
I can't remember how I cried then , but I'll cry all over again .
It's your presence that draws out this blood from his empty veins .
You're absolutely right , your highness .
That would be a little extreme !
Just send him here , and I'll persuade him .
As for Michael Cassio , I think it would be safe for me to swear that he's honest .
I'll be there shortly .
I'm right behind you .
They vanished strangely .
Sir , pardon me for what I am about to say .
Now I must return to the wedding .
We meant to tell the king that his orders have been carried out , and Rosencrantz and Guildenstern are dead .
Thieves !
A gullible father and a brother who's so innocent that he can't suspect anyone else of wanting to hurt him , these are the two fools I need for my plan to work .
Sir , be a man .
If I stay longer , I'll embarrass you and disgrace myself by crying .
No , not like before .
Stanley dreamed the boar beheaded him , and I laughed and refused to flee with him .
I like her more than I can say .
I can't speak to her , even though she asked me to .
What does the golden box say ?
You did .
He's bound to Octavia .
Is that possible ?
Whatever I say , or think , or do , you're continually contradicting it .
If I told you that , what would I get out of it ?
The harvest comes shortly after that .
He'd begged me to steal it many times .
What's that , you runt ?
I put my trust in you .
Where are your sister and Hortensio's wife ?
The thane of Fife had a wife .
He can't be Fortune ; he's only Fortune's errand boy .
Don't you hear it ring ?
Justice , find the girl !
How many wonderful creatures there are here !
If that's all , gentlemen , I see no problem .
That's very strange .
If he struggles , use force !
What , do you think we're Turks or savages , instead of Christians ?
You don't think you can teach her ?
Be patient .
Oh , did he ?
Let's slash their backs and grab 'em like we do rabbits , from behind .
I knew that would be your answer .
Yes , Shylock , I'll sign the contract and agree to its terms .
When should the royal day be ?
Me , uncle ?
What are you doing , Caesar ?
Certainly .
Take a trumpet , herald .
It would be wonderfully wise of you , my dear Reynaldo , to ask around about his behavior a little before you visit him .
Hey , hey !
You know where I'll be waiting .
Oh Margaret , Margaret , your heavy curse has now landed on poor Hastings's miserable head !
Such a kind father ! , Are my horses ready ?
Did you see him ?
Lovely Beatrice , I thank you for taking the pains to tell me that .
Your behavior is an insult to all women .
She's dead to me .
There is a poor old man who , purely out of love , has limped after me for miles .
Alas , why would you heap all these responsibilities on me ?
But wait , what's that sound ?
But no beautiful woman has an honest face .
So take her , shepherd , and God bless you .
That's unbelievably bad .
In this world , I'm only taking up space .
I could make the same boast even if I had a pig as my mistress .
Don't trouble him further until his mind is more settled .
Oh , these fools !
I admit two sleeves .
I hope to God I'm wrong about your chances .
And let the wise man run away .
The cold wind blows through the hawthorn trees .
Oh , help !
Past noon .
What do you say ?
Get me out of here !
Ophelia , come here. , I hear him coming .
But I thank God that I failed in my scheme , and I rejoice in paying the penalty , as I beg God and you to pardon me .
No .
Even if we don't fight foreign enemies , we'll beat down these rebels at home .
But a handkerchief , God , I wish I could forget about the handkerchief !
She said she wished she hadn't heard it , but she also wished there was a man like me for her .
Fine .
Messenger after messenger delivered news of your bravery to the king with praise for how you defended his country .
Isn't that the king ?
You're talking like some innocent girl who doesn't understand the ways of the world .
Pardon me but I do not know what is "like me." An angel is like you , Kate , and you are like an angel .
Nobody I care about more than myself .
Emilia , go to the castle and tell Othello and Desdemona what happened. , Will you please go now ?
Yes , mother , but I wish I hadn't .
He may command me as my king , but you still have power over me as a relative .
I swear by the heavens , which have grown pale in sympathy with us , I'm going with you , whatever you say .
You always loved to tell me I couldn't do anything without being told .
And what is that music ?
No doubt it will , my liege , if each man does his best .
Do you know me ?
Richmond is sailing on the sea .
What , like stuff from a house ?
Well , let's hope you stay in that noble frame of mind .
There will be a feast from five o'clock until eleven .
But what if my answer's no ?
Kiss her soft mouth , and we'll be off .
Well , so-so .
I could do without another toast .
Then I'll water all those precious herbs with my tears to make them grow .
I'm not competitive like Antony .
My dear Gloucester !
Why , last night .
Welcome , dear madam .
If you really feel that way , then I hope you won't kill me .
I say it's the moon .
She's full of good advice .
Yes , you poor ghost , as long as I have any power of memory in this distracted head .
They swore you did .
I'm only crazy sometimes .
There's nothing more .
I won't follow him around with useless pleas anymore .
How can Caesar be a tyrant then ?
Oh , what a sad sight !
I followed it here , or I should say it dragged me here .
There's nothing to get upset about .
It's difficult to have such immaturity so close to my heart , but bear with me .
I can tell you who time strolls for , who it trots for , who it gallops for , and who it stops cold for .
What's wrong , cousin ?
Leah gave it to me before we were married .
Lovers , it's time to go to bed .
How are you , my royal lord ?
My spirit has been as proud as each of yours , my courage as great , and my reason perhaps even better suited to bandy words back and forth and exchange frown for frown .
Change into better clothes .
My new master is expecting your approach .
I wouldn't do it for a nice ring , or fine linen , or pretty gowns or petticoats or hats .
It's meant in good will .
I myself heard the king say he would not be ransomed .
Are you scared ?
Come on .
You're talking in such a crazy way , sir .
In suicide , gods allow tyrants to be defeated .
Murder , murder !
Have I done something to offend you without knowing it ?
No , stop .
How green !
A crazy bastard .
Damn it all to hell !
At least I've got some booze to comfort me .
Oh , killing that child was the dirtiest , most merciless deed there ever was !
Leave you alone !
Silvius , keep your promise to marry Phoebe if she refuses me .
Just tell me what to do , and I'll do it .
They probably received warning about how much I stirred up the people .
That's like hot ice and strange snow .
Tell the hot-headed duke that I, But no , not yet .
Where's the evidence against me ?
Oh , Regan , she's torn me apart with unkindness , like a vulture , right here .
But , tell me , is young George Stanley alive ?
Christ , it's a disaster .
People with too much invested in the world always get hurt .
I like your new wig and headdress , though I'd like it more if the hair were a shade browner .
Canidius and the others that left Antony are given hospitality here but no positions of trust .
Please , stop bowing , good sir .
It's almost four .
And this is all because of our argument .
But you have all the advantages from the harm done .
She picks it up quick , doesn't she ?
By running fast .
Have you heard this , Cassio ?
She thanked me and told me that if a friend of mine had a story like mine to tell , she'd fall in love with him .
Who's there ?
A fortunate coincidence , more fortunate for your son .
Then I'll change it to this : Father Time himself is bald , so for all time there will be bald men .
What do you want ?
But his frail heart , too weak to grapple with such a conflict between joy and sadness , gave out .
The second I saw you , my heart rushed to serve you and be your slave , so here I am now , a patient log-man .
Sir , we came to see your father's funeral .
St. George loses his holiness once Then , by myself , You've misused yourself .
Come down , look no more .
Think about it .
Welcome , sir .
It's not safe to go near them till we get more help .
Say that I hope he never has cause to look for a new master .
The saddle maker has it , sir , I didn't keep it .
She's obedient , a fine lady .
I would have sworn that , too , my lord , especially against Benedick .
What can you swear by now ?
He rode that prologue like a wild horse .
BASSANIO Please , Leonardo , think about this I'll do my best .
Since I was so drawn to studying things like logic , grammar , geometry , and astronomy , I let my control of the government slide a bit , being too wrapped up in my occult books .
But where is my love ?
For various reasons that must remain secret , please do this for me .
I'd do it myself , but I can't leave my post .
I'll move to a more open place and there speak to great Caesar as he walks past .
Horns ?
For God knows how many healthy men will shed their blood in support of whatever you persuade me to do .
In exchange for the blood I shed for you then , I ask you for justice now .
So tell me , Grumio , how goes the world ?
You go pale , you stare , and you act in awe of the strange disturbance in the heavens .
Rest assured that we're going there to use our hands , not our tongues .
Ranting and raving to my own shadow !
Let us in so we can tie him up tight and bring him home to recover .
That's right , except for the widow Dido .
Here comes the Emperor .
Let me go , gentlemen .
My master said it .
There's nothing like good hay , really sweet hay .
Oh , he's been betrayed , and I've been ruined .
You weren't given any gold ?
You can hear them all night long .
If any legs here are Trinculo's , these are .
Whoa , man , you dare to support someone who's been proclaimed a traitor ?
You can see how it is all around .
Why are you enraged ?
Goodbye , Launcelot .
Stand aside , Captain Gower .
My uncle is king of Denmark , and the same people who made fun of him while my father was still alive are now rushing to pay twenty , forty , fifty , a hundred ducats apiece for miniature portraits of him .
Yes , you would beg , if you were in my position .
What kind of scheme do you have going together ?
Repent and avoid damnation .
My lord of Orleans , and my lord high Constable , are you talking about horses and armor ?
Yes , my lord .
For what favor ?
I pity your situation .
No .
Pick up her bed and carry her ladies out of the tomb .
Don't be afraid .
Go to sleep , and listen to us laughing .
He'd better not speak badly of Brutus here .
Seriously , though , son Petruchio , I think you have the most thoroughgoing shrew of us all .
The king's in bed .
I really want to sleep now .
And to you , most noble Caesar .
I'm sorry to have to say this , Help me away from here , dear Charmian !
And , make no mistake , you'll find , as we his subjects have , an amazing difference between the king as a young man and the way he is now .
To answer your question , ma'am , yes , he was friendly with those knights .
I was sure that you hadn't given it to me .
Is it feasible ?
Little pitchers have big ears .
It's a good thing for you that , being castrated , you can better concentrate on my needs .
Is it "chaste in word and action" ?
If I were you with eyes and a tongue to speak with , I'd crack heaven wide open with my laments !
Stay warm .
I agree , Put a mark next to his name too , Antony .
Oh that great , funny guy , Bottom !
Please get him , my friend , I beg you .
Yes , madam , but he'll be back tonight .
What did he say when he regained consciousness ?
Oh , will it never be day ?
And , gentle Puck , take this transformed ass's head off of the head of that Athenian man , so that when he wakes up at the same time as the rest of them do , they can all go back to Athens .
Is that how it's going to be ?
Are you all good and honest men ?
No , afterward .
Take off my mistress ' gown for your master's use !
Here's the water , right ?
What's the news abroad ?
Goodnight , Michael .
It has been done already , and the messenger is on his way .
It was carried to Colmekill to be placed in the tomb of his ancestors , where their bones are kept safe .
Take out your sword .
Goodbye .
That's most appropriate .
It's cheap and nasty !
Here's another , stronger than the first .
Let's follow them to see how this turns out .
We don't doubt it .
I'm sorry about what happened , but I'm sure everything will turn out all right .
get his position and use him to hurt Othello at the same time ?
The Moor's killed my mistress !
Here is the door , sir .
And yet I do love you .
Without doubt I've heard that .
No , my friends , don't please fate by giving it your sorrow as well .
Weren't you banished on pain of death ?
Have her send it to me .
Or had a friend who would be a man for me !
But that would ruin his reputation !
When she put it on my finger , she made me swear never to sell it , give it away , or lose it .
What does she say , madam interpreter ?
I heard him swear he did .
So is Lysander .
You should get a wife !
There was a noise , that's certainly true .
Are you sure of that ?
And if we don't shake hands , when I act all nice to the players it will seem like I'm happier to see them than you .
Blow the trumpets .
My body waits here , but the rest of me is gone .
That's a good way of putting it .
I'd rather get a husband from your father .
So she is drowned .
But it was also prophesied that the crown would not go to your descendants , and that my sons and grandsons would be kings instead .
Our advance will so dazzle the enemy that England will cower in fear and surrender .
I'll make you an example for the others to learn from .
But do this : find your brother , wherever he is .
Is that his answer ?
All right , I will .
Why stay when love tells you to go ?
Why do you ask ?
Then you have to say , "I take you , Rosalind , to be my lawfully wedded wife." I take you , Rosalind , to be my lawfully wedded wife .
Lysander , keep your Hermia .
But fortune could not reward me better than to let me die well , without owing my master anything .
Oh , gods , give me patience !
Ever since Venus and her blind son plotted a way for the god of the underworld to steal my daughter away for half the year , I swore I'd never speak to them again .
Ring the alarm bell .
A reason ?
The wine of life has been poured out , and only the dregs remain .
How's that ?
Isn't that your habit ?
Tie him up , I tell you .
No harm was done .
Forever and a day .
Please let me go .
But who's with him ?
Give me your love instead , as I give you mine .
Not for a second .
Why do you spit at me ?
Shall we call in the ambassador , my liege ?
It's time for you to know the whole story .
It's difficult to bring two friends together , but even mountains can be moved together by earthquakes .
Make her sterile and dry up her womb so that no baby will ever come out of her body and honor her .
Stay and speak !
The storm separated us .
Hide her for a while in your house , and tell everyone that she has , in fact , died .
Oh dear gods !
I'm dying for food , so let me have some .
Come on , good fellow , help me into that armor you're carrying .
If you read this , Caesar , you might live .
I wouldn't care about my spirits , if my legs weren't tired .
Tell me again , where did you leave those lowlifes ?
May the devil turn you black , you white-faced fool !
Try to get him to do that .
A pretty pathetic monster .
It's too bad .
Order them to move back .
What do you mean , get rid of him ?
Now they work for me .
The name suits your fierceness .
Imagine , me , a drunk !
Then I'd be punished for the sins of my mother .
I think I'm getting delirious .
Nym , what you say is true .
Your Clarence , who stabbed my Edward , is also dead .
The most important thing for you to think about is how beautiful his daughter is .
Niece , will you take care of those things I mentioned ?
Heaven knows .
On this hill and in despair , with his slave Pindarus .
I wish I were , so I could deprive you of both day and life .
Oh , fine .
Sit down , worthy friends .
I'm sure he will stay under control .
Be kind and polite to this gentleman .
For God's sake , find a house to duck into .
But where's my fool ?
I'm at your service , madam .
He doesn't have children .
May you only give birth to male children , because your fearless spirit should create nothing that isn't masculine .
If that's true , he won't get it back by crying .
Before I hear him , I want to decide some important issues that are on my mind concerning my throne and France .
She speaks daggers , and every word stabs .
Well , good luck to them tonight in bed !
By Jesus , I am your Majesty's countryman , and I don't care who knows it .
Here's someone coming in his pajamas , with a candle and weapons .
Pick me up .
Casca , you'll be the first to raise your hand .
tody of them so I can do what's best out of concern for their honor and the safety of the kingdom .
Well , I wouldn't want to undo the naughtiness , since the boy turned out so well .
Over your wounds , which , like speechless mouths , open their red lips , as though to beg me to speak , I predict that a curse will fall upon the bodies of men .
Good morning , gentlemen .
In that case I wish you were as good a man as a fish seller .
I have no more royal sons for you to murder .
What blessed work , my king .
It was love that performed these miracles .
If I tremble then , you can call me a little girl .
I wear it with pride , for I am Welsh you know , good countryman .
When such a great man dies there should be a thunderclap .
Are the others waiting ?
Help , dear lord , or the battle will be lost !
Some other time .
I'll take comfort in my books and music , reading and practicing my instruments .
Yes , that's the one .
Your two sons ?
But , hey , this doesn't mean you're looking to get married , does it ?
Ma'am , you wouldn't treat me like this if I were your father's dog .
A man is master of his own freedom : time is his only master , and when the right moment comes along , he'll come or go as he pleases .
If what you say is true , you can do the same to me .
He's called Modo and Mahu .
We'll have the barber trim it later , along with your beard .
You can push my buttons , but you can't play me for a fool .
The partygoers have arrived .
Let me see it .
Give me your hand , Roderigo .
Here is the count of the slaughtered French .
I won't keep you very long .
What should I do that I'm not doing ?
What a tedious wait !
Where did she die ?
Lord , may I never see a day of trouble until the day I let someone treat me like that .
They're ready whenever you are .
He rushed away on serious business .
Yes , but I didn't see anything wrong , and I heard every syllable they said .
No , I didn't , but I did every night for the past year .
Bridegroom ?
So hurry up , because we have twenty miles to cover today .
I saw Mark Antony offer him a crown , though it wasn't a real crown , just a small circlet , and , as I told you , he refused it once , though in my opinion he would've liked to have it .
If you're smart , you'll go home .
This harms my reputation .
And love doesn't have good judgment either , Cupid , has wings and no eyes , so he's bound to be reckless and hasty .
Because he's daring us to do it .
Benedick , did you notice Signior Leonato's daughter ?
Yes , I do .
Did he stare at you ?
I love him even when he's harsh and mean , Help me unpin this , would you ? , I love even his stubbornness , his frowns , his bad moods .
I found her adjusting the crown on her dead mistress .
Listen , sad friends , though the gods may rebuke me , this news would make kings cry .
The town is asking for a pause in the fighting for negotiation .
No , my lord .
I'm satisfied .
I certainly do have him , but I wouldn't advise you to touch him .
You are welcome here .
Count Claudio , when do you plan to go to church and be married ?
Did you see the weird sisters ?
I'll show you how kind I am .
Stop !
She's weak and will die unless you comfort her .
What a fearful night this is !
Goodbye .
Forgotten you !
Just because I act familiar with you sometimes and let you fool around and joke with me , you try to take advantage of my affection .
Come on .
I haven't done anything wrong .
Keep your voice down .
Don't tone things down or exaggerate them out of hostility .
You're not really my daughter , but I still have one daughter left .
A hundred and sixty-eight hours ?
When we're faced with a wretched person , bruised and crying with hardship , we try to get them to shush up .
I have no doubt that it will be a swift and successful war , since God so graciously exposed this dangerous plot .
Which one will start yammering first , Gonzalo or Adrian ?
But God forbid he says no to us !
I tell you , Captain , if you look at a map of the world , I'll bet you will find , comparing Macedon and Monmouth , that the situations , see , are very similar .
Got it ?
So the candle went out and now we're all in the dark .
You're hitting close to home there .
A friend .
Here comes your father .
I tell you , I feel very jolly remembering such a beautiful dream .
No , this fun is not for me .
He deserves a beautiful wife more than all the other men I've ever seen .
What's your answer ?
This doesn't look like a wedding .
I'll put the juice of this flower on Titania's eyes , and fill her with horrible delusions and desires .
Pray God does some surgery on you : you need to be fixed .
Be calm !
What's the matter with you now ?
I'll drain the life out of him .
He's been in an unusually good mood and has granted many gifts to your household and servants .
If you interrupt this monster with one more word , I'll beat you like a piece of salted fish .
I'm not afraid of anyone but him .
I'll tell you , Cassius , you yourself have been called greedy and been accused of giving your positions to undeserving men in exchange for gold .
My lord , when I arrived at their home I gave them your letter .
But if you didn't know about it , then you were wrong to get mad at us .
How is lieutenant Cassio ?
Did you talk with him ?
Go , get out !
Do you lie still ?
He hasn't told this to the king , has he ?
I'll say good-bye now .
Scratch my head , Peaseblossom .
Then Dobbin's tail must be growing backward .
Drowned ?
Start without me .
Gone ?
And wouldn't I be damned if I let this monster live to do more harm ?
Be brave and do well !
Say the last word I spoke was "Antony , " and please word it pathetically .
Where are they ?
Drink when I order you , servant-monster .
Carthage ?
I loved this man so much it makes me weep .
Who sent you this time ?
You've stolen both my job and my name !
Right or not , it's made you the Earl of Gloucester .
The king was wearing exactly this armor when he fought the king of Norway .
You tie up horses by their heads , dogs and bears by their necks , monkeys by their waists , and humans by their legs .
Yes , indeed they are .
My Will you come on , cousin ?
Wake up when something nasty is nearby .
A ship you sent me to find , to book passage out of here .
A little food and a huge welcome makes a joyous feast .
Now it's time to get your costumes together .
Oh , you mean when Beatrice writes a letter and Hero sees that it has "Benedick" and "Beatrice" written all over it ?
Will the moon be shining on the night we're performing our play ?
I , sir , am Dromio .
The worst thing imaginable has happened .
If the job had been painful , I would not have come .
The games are done and Caesar is returning .
But gentle heavens , don't keep me waiting .
My own safety is the only important thing now .
He's not brave enough to be wise .
Oh ho , oh ho !
So I recommend you take note of what I'm about to say .
Me too , I won't , I swear to God .
The king wishes to know if you want to play against him right away , or wait awhile .
If I were , I wouldn't need to ask you what happened .
That's authority !
Sweet Desdemona !
Soak your hands in blood and gore , since you have cut the thread of his life with scissors .
O , this evil wind that spreads nothing but misery .
He swears he used to be a courtier .
Don't you have any manners , you savage ?
Since the light of my life has gone out , I'll stop here .
My lord !
These revelations have overwhelmed her .
Here , take my sword .
It is rather cold , indeed , my lord .
Yes ?
Moors are moody people. , So sell your lands and raise a lot of cash .
God should keep me from false friends , but they weren't false .
I'm not sure about that .
There'd be no kingship , He wants to be king in a place with no kingship .
Either here or at the Capitol .
You thought about it too long , considering what you found there .
Let's act quickly .
My fair Bianca , bid my father welcome , while I with equal affection welcome yours .
Go , Pindarus , climb a little higher on this hill .
That wicked Jew got the duke to listen to his complaints .
Now , Iras , what do you think ?
And those who leave their valiant bones in France , dying like men though buried in your dunghills , they'll be remembered , too .
What ?
Let me ask you a particular question .
That was no show .
Has Banquo left the court ?
No , girl !
Is he alone ?
Go play with yourself .
Not now .
Did you call me ?
What have you got on your head ?
As long as you aren't ashamed to show it , he won't be ashamed to tell you what it means .
I never gave him reason to be jealous .
So you've dared him to single combat .
Come in out of the storm .
No , after you .
I'm ready now .
Heaven knows what secrets she's keeping .
Then give it a nice welcome , as you would give to any stranger .
We follow in your orbit , and you have the power to move us .
Go relax now .
I don't have that kind of reputation !
I'll copy the embroidery pattern and then give it to Iago .
Yet not one among them , if all three were to wait on me , could be my "man , " because three such fakes don't amount to a man .
Mark Antony is in your tents , my lord .
I'm not talking with you .
It would follow from this that the cat should stay home .
My mask is like the roof of the poor
Messala !
You're so infatuated with him that you're hallucinating .
Come on , can I get you two to make up ?
I swear I'll smack you if you hit me again .
We're searching on land , but he's lost in the sea .
God protect me from these two !
They're never jealous for a reason ; they're just jealous .
I know you for what you really are , but as your sister I'm reluctant to criticize you .
We'll go to the river .
The change will be recorded as a precedent , and many bad legal decisions will result .
Madam !
A veteran commander and a very kind gentleman .
They're more like how you would act if you were a woman telling a scary story by the fireside in front of her grandmother .
Out of the frying pan and into the fire , from a tyrant duke to a tyrant brother !
My old bones are tired .
But she is now Mark Antony's wife .
I'll carry prayer books in my pocket and look sweet , even more .
But he's young , and as long as he's too young to become king , Richard , the duke of Gloucester , has power over him .
I hope that , after I tell you my news , you will think better of me .
You know , I saw the Duchess of Milan's gown , the one that everyone praises so highly .
If I live to see it , I'll never trust his word again .
Whenever he talks about her he can't stop laughing .
I never saw her till now .
He's done wrong , and his master the king will punish him for it .
I've never seen a creature with a human shape who was so eager to destroy a man .
She deserves to have rocks and stones thrown on her body .
I have already .
Nothing that you want to hear , my lord , but nothing so bad that I can't mention it .
Come with me and let me advise you .
Who are you ?
I did that to him .
He'll go back to his Egyptian dish .
Ha , ha , ha !
She mocks all her suitors so severely that they drop the suit .
It's not a false gallop , anyway .
Please put that log down and rest a while .
But let's see once more what the gold one says : "He who chooses me will get what many men want." That's Portia !
If I can find any animal in this wild forest , I'll either be food for it or bring it as food for you .
I must go and continue the business Fulvia started .
I won't wrong any of my friends , because I don't have any to mourn for me , and I won't have wronged the world , because I don't have anything in the world .
I'll bring you to him .
Make sure that the clowns do not ad-lib , since some of them will make certain dumb audience members laugh mindlessly at them , while an important issue in the play needs to be addressed .
How long has he been possessed like this ?
Right now you swear to me that you are a virgin ; if you were a poet , I might have some hope you were lying .
Yes , I was , but I don't want an answer from you .
I'm learning every hour how to be subservient .
My letters say there are a hundred and seven ships .
I can't , my lord .
Give our officers notice of our intentions .
Now , though , in all of Rome , there's room for only one man .
My spells are working well , my spirits are obeying me , and everything is right on schedule .
It's the best thing to do .
What trade , boy ?
I'm not drunk .
I'll do it with all my heart .
Thank you very much .
At least I don't have a horse for my mistress , or a saying so beside the point .
Good , I'm satisfied .
What ?
But Miranda is so much more beautiful , you can't even compare the two .
Until Birnam Wood gets up and moves to Dunsinane , I won't be affected by fear .
Okay , let's go !
to have a stupid wife .
I don't want anything but that .
Don't let the heavens hear these chattery women abuse the Lord's anointed king .
Which ring did you give away , my lord ?
Why are you curious , Iago ?
Oh , it's horrible , horrible , so horrible !
There's my dagger Put away your dagger .
He does indeed show sparks of something like wit .
I did , my lord .
I'm an honest Puck , and I swear that if we're lucky enough not to get hissed at , we'll make it up to you soon .
Ouch , what a comeback !
I swear that Claudio will pay dearly for this .
So cheer up .
Leave Hermia alone .
Oh , my dear Cassio !
I want to learn how to lie .
This epitaph will hang here forever , Continuing to praise Hero after I die .
We'll talk more about this later. , Egeus , I'm overriding your wishes .
They say they have letters for you .
Being too old to marry someone young .
Oh wicked wall , through which I don't see any happiness !
Listen !
It's a wonder you didn't lose your life and your mind all at once. , He's waking up .
And I am , I am .
Who says he is ?
And even then , in order for me to catch the fly your cousin , she must be blind ?
Do I know these men who are with you ?
But I will go out , for these bad omens apply to the world in general as much as they do to me .
I'm amazed you're still talking , Signior Benedick .
Cassio's a handsome man .
And how do you like Lord Bassanio's wife ?
Father , go ahead .
If you ever loved me , then please postpone the sweet relief of death awhile , and stay in this harsh world long enough to tell my story .
Come with me tonight , and you'll see a man enter her bedroom chamber , even tonight , the night before her wedding .
I have made your daughter mine by marriage while false impressions blinded your eyes .
Have you heard any news of impending battle ?
He was a great human being .
As king of this country I like to reward wit when I hear it .
Yoo-hoo !
Tonight let's have plenty to eat .
Is that a lot of He says his name is Master Fer .
Don't greet your bride in these disgraceful clothes .
Who's calling me ?
If we'd fought like this before , we'd have driven them home with bandaged heads .
Leave me alone , Desdemona , go away !
What endeavor , Popillius ?
Is there any way I could show such friendship to you ?
In ten days time , if you're found within twenty miles of the court , you'll die for it .
It was tossed into the window of my room .
I've been here too long .
But ships are just fragile boards , and sailors are just men .
It's too small for your large mind .
What's going on ?
There isn't any other way , unless you took on another form and became someone else .
He's just Launcelot .
You're sure full of smooth answers .
How could you ask ?
I learned it in England , where they have a talent for drinking .
As I get to leech him , I will show some mercy .
I'm not really Litio .
Now , my lord , what are we going to do if we find that Lord Hastings won't go along with our plans ?
When you've finished all this , return to the porch of Pompey's theater , where you'll find us .
She is dead .
He is an animal worthy of Perseus .
A spirit ?
That's a stupid thing to say .
From this moment on , I'll never say another word .
And
And why are you so pale ?
The noble Brutus told you that Caesar was ambitious .
Take that , and that .
For you , our swords have blunt edges , too dull to harm you , Mark Antony .
Is it possible to be wise , bewildered , calm , furious , loyal , and neutral all at once ?
Very clever !
Think about that , and about what followed afterward .
Besides , the king's name is a tower of strength ; the opposition doesn't have that advantage .
Be quiet , Signior Gremio .
It seems not .
I thank you , lady .
Well , then , I hope he chokes on it !
I wrote a verse to this tune , though it's not very imaginative .
Your highness will have to force me to tell .
All you English princes , I salute you .
Yes , dear madam .
I don't think a ridiculous Pyramus like that one deserves much moaning .
If it's sad to see a handsome man with a cheating wife , it's a tragedy to see an ugly thug with a wife who's faithful .
You'll know about that later .
What would you like , Laertes ?
How are you , Hamlet ?
We'll see them immediately .
And its tears are wet .
My Lord of Warwick , a most corrupt treason , God be praised for it ! , has been discovered , as plain as any you'd hope to see on a summer's day .
Oh , sir , pardon me !
They burn for revenge .
Banquo and Macbeth , all hail !
May the good Lord keep me safe from all women like her !
To be brief , as the occasion requires , prepare to fight early in the morning , when your future will be decided .
But as for now , before two weeks have gone by , I'm going to send some people packing .
Oh , oh , oh !
I don't until you practice them on me .
You think about him too much .
Instead , she puts flowers in the boy's hair and makes a fuss over him .
Hello , spirit !
Tell me , good Brutus , can you see your face ?
Don't think I blame you .
You've bet on the weaker fencer .
Dear man , calm your rage .
In a way , I mean .
Will you abandon her ?
Please don't , sir .
I tell you , there are good men born at Monmouth .
Observe how Antony takes his defeat and how his attitude influences his actions .
Quiet , I say .
Hang our flags on the outer walls .
A prison like that would give me enough liberty .
For heaven's sake , stop this savage brawl !
Oh , the sixpence you gave me last Wednesday to buy leather goods for my mistress ?
Who does time amble for ?
Lock the door .
Good morning , Caesar .
They've switched their operation to the sea today .
They say Gloucester's bastard son is .
Quiet !
Well , I'll go to Scone .
She's always talking when I want to sleep .
Girls , girls !
Yes , we're the privates in her army .
Until the day we die , my lord .
A woman owes her husband the same loyalty a subject owes his king .
But I have a legitimate son a few years older than this one , and I don't love him any more than I love my bastard .
Are you drunk ?
Please stand up !
For lead ?
We understand you're just doing it for us , and we'll be sure to say so .
I've been looking all over for you .
Ha , ha , heard in Genoa .
This one talks about how Roderigo should kill Cassio .
Do you have the flower ?
But those who understood him smiled at one another and shook their heads .
What are you talking about ?
Good morning to all these lovely people .
But Angelo , you'll pay for this , even if it costs all the precious metals in your jewelry shop .
We hope your poison has worn off and this day shall transform all grievances and quarrels into friendship .
You couldn't find out anything about them ?
If your love was anything like mine , and I'm sure that no man has loved as I love now , exactly how many ridiculous actions did your fantasizing lead you to ?
He's a marvelously witty fellow , no doubt , but I'll outmaneuver him. , Come over here ; I'll whisper a word in your ear .
You say you're a better soldier .
The actors are here .
Make a bug show of mourning for her , hang sad epitaphs up at your family's tomb , and perform all the appropriate burial ceremonies .
I wish the lightning had burned up all those logs that you've been ordered to stack !
Let's proceed on our march to Birnam .
Get them in here .
They are , my lord .
Is he dead ?
So have your money ready .
The law has another hold on you .
Do you have anything else to tell me ?
Come on , I won't stand for it anymore .
Why , what's the matter ?
Disgusting !
She's full of good intentions .
Ha !
You just fell the height of ten ship masts , straight down .
A virtuous woman won't give her husband horns , and my Rosalind is definitely virtuous .
Examine them yourselves , then bring me your findings .
You are welcome here , as are all of you English princes .
Captain Macmorris , I think , see , correct me if I'm wrong , there are not many of your nation , My nation ?
Montjoy .
Why , so did you .
Here , catch this box .
Let's go .
God save the charitable organization !
That can't happen .
What does she want ?
If you pay too much attention to him you'll make him angry , and that will make his convulsions go on longer .
But oh , how odd it is to have to ask for my child's forgiveness !
What is it , sir ?
Don't be disturbed by my illness .
My leg's been cut in two .
Our action will seem too bloody if we cut off Caesar's head and then hack at his arms and legs too , Caius Cassius , because Mark Antony is merely one of Caesar's arms .
Let your anger fall on me then , even if its sharpness pierces my heart .
Tomorrow's a good day .
They're out to get me , and I won't stand for it !
Now , tailor , let's see what you've got .
Our knocking woke him up .
It won't last .
Please give me that .
I folded up the new document , signed it , sealed it , and put it safely back so that no one noticed any difference .
But I've often heard him argue that when sons are at their prime and their fathers are declining , the sons should be their fathers ' guardians and manage their fathers ' money .
Against my will , I've been told to bring you in to dinner .
I'm as commanding as she is proud , and when two raging fires meet , they end up consuming the very thing that kindled them .
My lord , his throat is cut .
I'll invite the duke and all of his followers .
Do you agree that Ferdinand must have drowned ?
Answer when I call your name. , Nick Bottom , the weaver ?
But I'm as noble as my opponent .
You mean the sun !
Oh , lieutenant !
Wait , here's a penny to heal your head .
I hear it now overhead .
Sirs , I ask you to sleep in my tent .
Please come with me .
And now that I have the boy , I'll undo the spell that makes her vision so disgustingly wrong .
No .
Are you playing tricks on me by showing me savages and uncivilized men from the Indies , ha ?
When you find out who started this disagreement , turn your anger upon them .
No , my lord .
What's that , my lord ?
Now , you tell me : should I feel loyal to the Moor ?
The lark shrilly singing up there is too far away to be heard .
If he has my father's love , then that's enough honor for me .
The sun is up and we're wasting the day !
The It's too bad there's more of the Moor than there ought to be .
Why not !
What support did I have other than Edward ?
Oh , my lord , when wisdom and passion are in one body , it's ten to one that the passion will win .
Play your flutes !
Are you really alive , Stephano ?
Would you tie me to a whole world of worries ?
You say the king is losing his mind .
My dear lord , you know how passionately stubborn the duke is .
I Isn't this good ?
In return , I must clear the sea of pirates and send tributes of wheat to Rome .
Never , my lord .
I'll send goblins out at night to work their nasty deeds on you .
With half the world opposing the other half , it wasn't the time for Antony , the pivotal player , to let love distract him .
jailer , i'm your prisoner .
There's no other way .
You admit it , then ?
I'm your advocate , and I'd rather die than give up on you .
That's the deal .
Oh , Kate , prudish customs bow before great kings .
Let's drink to our general !
Yes , I've been responsible for his upbringing .
I didn't think you would follow me .
Because if that's the case , I will tell you a plan that will get rid of your enemy and bring you closer to me .
Take a tip from me , then .
Where is the fool I sent on ahead ?
Gratiano !
I didn't write about breaking the alliance with Antony until I saw you were being misled and realized how dangerous it would be to keep postponing preparations .
Buckingham , I need to have a word with you .
What , my lord ?
This is Lucentio's house .
No , but Beatrice , Sweet Hero , she's been wronged , she's been slandered , she's been ruined .
Why , then , it's time to put on my armor and instruct the troops .
I won't be taken for a fool who sighs and gives in to Christian meddlers .
But , look , poor me , what a terrible tragedy is here !
What's the matter , lieutenant ?
He's nearby , and Pindarus has come to salute you on behalf of his master .
That's not a job for a friend , my lord .
Don't tell me that .
Eat and sleep .
I was afraid this would happen , because he was a noble , brave man , but I didn't think he had a weapon .
I regret all the boring time I wasted with her .
I'll be nearby .
Now he won't give me either .
If , then , that friend demands to know why I rose up against Caesar , this is my answer : it's not that I loved Caesar less , but that I loved Rome more .
He's without equal !
You're smart , though , and if you were sick , you'd take what you needed to get better .
But since the gibe glanced off me , ten to one it hit you both straight on .
I must be one of these silent so-called wise men Gratiano's talking about , because he never lets me get a word in .
I'll stay in Messina until you're married , and then I'll go to Aragon .
Stop arguing and listen to my plans .
You're making fun of me .
Yes , better than you know me .
Reading their mail isn't as bad .
I have lived long enough .
Do this immediately , and send him packing .
Sir Thomas Erpingham .
But don't be too tame , either , let your good sense guide you .
Let's listen to him .
Get her attention and draw her home with music .
Humble as I am , I represent Antony .
How are you , my lord ?
Oh , but she'll keep her word .
I do the wrong and am the first to start quarrels .
What else ?
Give me your hand , Messala .
Bring him to me .
Sweet Phoebe , have pity on me .
Of what city , may I ask ?
What news ?
Give me your hand .
This is the plague of important men , our wives betray us more than those of poor men .
Goneril , are you coming with us ?
Saint Davy's Day has passed .
If there are any , speak , for it is he whom I have offended .
It's true , they're inconsistent .
One smile from him would repair my decayed beauty .
Son , I'll stake you half that Bianca comes .
Shall we go send them food and fresh clothing and feed their starving horses before we fight them ?
Who's that coming ?
If Cleopatra hears even a breath of this , she'll die immediately .
It never ceases to amaze me the way people ignore the correct , traditional principles and rules of war .
That's Enobarbus ?
Don't .
You told me to make it well and properly and in keeping with the current style .
I know you know something , Thanks for the compliment , I'm happy you know that .
Relent , and save your souls .
He's having dinner tonight with a prostitute , and I'll go visit him .
That woman who claims I am her husband , I loathe her in my soul .
He is in love with Hero .
As I said before , Antonio will guarantee the loan .
My gracious lord , I should tell you what I saw , but I don't know how to say it .
Lucius !
Tie him up like a thief and bring him here to me .
And do you mean what you're saying , Gratiano ?
God bless you , Bottom , God bless you .
Well , thank you .
He can sniff his way to Dover .
You're sharpening that knife not on your sole but on your soul , you cruel Jew .
And I get sick when I can't look at you .
No , just help me unpin this .
Look , here she comes !
That's the next thing on the agenda .
Is she as tall as I am ?
And I see her also through the eyes of love .
If things are the way people tell me they are , and they're only telling me this to warn me , then I have to say , you're not conducting yourself with the self-restraint a daughter of mine should show .
It is for your ears only .
We just want you to answer to your real name .
Oh Nerissa , my poor little body is tired of this great big world .
Before I fall asleep , I entrust my soul to you .
I like him very well .
You didn't go to sleep , then ?
Don't ask why .
What time is it ?
I'll bleed to death .
The earth sings when he touches it .
Good sir , calm down .
It's on such a high tide that we're now floating , and we must take the current when it is offered , or lose our campaign .
Where's Antony now ?
I swear , old fools become like babies again .
God keep me so. , Heralds , go with him .
While you were dazed by grief , which isn't appropriate for a man like you , Cassio showed up here .
It's a villain and a bastard and a coward and a rascal .
You unwashed farmworker !
Oh , the man who avenged her could ask anything of me !
Good-bye .
Look , here he comes .
I didn't think I would see you here .
But sir , there is no such house , no such maid , and no such men as you have dreamed up , like a certain Stephen Sly and one old John Naps of Greece , a Peter Turph , one "Henry Pimpernell , " and twenty more men of this sort , who never actually existed .
Hello !
Have you not spoken to her since then ?
What have I said in my grief ?
Yes , sir , very well , I'm here in your orchard .
No .
Now go , and hurry back .
Get out , insolent eunuch !
So , good-bye .
What's going on ?
Don't be shy , shake hands with me .
Then , like prophets , they named him the father to a line of kings .
She takes these signs for warnings and predictions of terrible evils to come , and , on her knee , she begged me to stay home today .
Oh , I'm sick , sick !
Were these things we're talking about really here ?
Donalbain .
Sir , these accusations should be answered .
Come , sweet nymphs , and help us celebrate the wedding of two true lovers .
Kill me tomorrow , but let me live tonight .
He got there too late .
And you must think people are stupid if you believe they wouldn't realize all the motives you have for trying to kill me." Oh , how monstrously evil !
Hang on , sir !
This is a small house .
Please , pretty young man , I'd like to get to know you better .
Noble friends , let's kill him boldly but not with anger .
Benedick's heart is like a bell , with his tongue as the clapper : everything his heart thinks , his tongue speaks .
Is Clarence dead ?
No .
It is not nighttime now .
We can't go on with this plan .
After you harvest , you have to sheaf and bind So throw ripe Rosalind on the harvest cart .
Oh , then I guess she was old and gentle , and you rode barelegged , like an Irish yokel .
I hope I enjoy wearing it , for my heart is very heavy .
It may be , it certainly may be .
Come , Ariel , I summon you with a thought .
And that's true , he Then I pleaded for you .
I know they're in Rome together , hoping for Antony to return .
I bet it's a love letter !
I'm sure his majesty will recover his health soon .
What's the play called ?
Didn't you tell me that I'd be able to recognize the man by the Athenian clothes he was wearing ?
What would you say to me now if I really were your precious little Rosalind ?
I don't have a lord .
I think that's strange .
Yes , my good lord .
But please , father , the question is still nagging at me , why did you conjure up this storm ?
We'll watch them starve to death first .
She's yours. , Come , Ariel !
My Lord of Cambridge and my good Lord of Masham and you , my noble knight , what do you think ?
I hid under this monster's cloak to get out of the storm .
Let him mount the pulpit .
Certainly not !
Therefore , dear Isis , do the right thing and give him the fortune he deserves .
Let's stay and watch .
Make room for Antony , most noble Antony !
I said "your husband." , Do you understand that word ?
My master will be here in the morning .
Not at all , Touchstone .
And I your servant .
Lock the doors , my lord .
Don't think I'm in love with him just because I'm asking about him .
Bless your heart .
Let me lick your shoe .
Who am I then ?
No , you can't do that until you take her hand and , in front of this friar , swear to marry her .
Yes , you're absolutely right .
My clerk has some comforting news for you , too .
What , in my presence ?
Say no more .
I'm almost ready to break down hearing this much .
I said so , dear Katherine , and I'm not ashamed to repeat it .
Hey monster , the spirit you've been talking about , the one you call harmless , has been playing tricks on us .
Please , young sir .
And you can't put your heads together and figure out why he's acting so dazed and confused , ruining his peace and quiet with such dangerous displays of lunacy ?
If love has touched you , love has touched you , end of story .
He'll kill me with tortures .
She was fickle and unfaithful , like water .
Hate it , fear it , do not come inside .
Thank you .
Welcome , traveler .
Let's fall on our swords .
It was probably just a rumor .
Where's my notebook ? , It's a good idea for me to write down that one can smile and smile , and be a villain .
Ambassadors of Harry , king of England , request a hearing with your Majesty .
What do you think of marching to Philippi immediately ?
But not for long ; Charles will take care of everything .
I don't feel anything .
Look at you , standing there in a stupor !
Well done !
Good morning , gentlemen .
You can command a beggar to bow on bended knee , but can you take possession of his health ?
You have impatience all over your face .
With him out of Venice , I can make whatever bargains I want when I lend money. , Go , Tubal .
Yes , I guarantee he won't drown , even if this ship were as fragile as an eggshell and as leaky as a menstruating woman .
Who's in there ?
Go to him , madam , speak to him .
He has no friends except those who are too afraid to defy him .
I say you're not .
Even that I could put up with .
Pretending ?
I am the son of Marcus Cato !
Let it be .
It's a horrible thing to die when you're not prepared for it , my gracious lord .
Are you indeed ?
Macbeth is ripe for the picking .
I'll run from this woman who claims to be my wife as fast as I'd run from a bear .
I've never heard of that .
We're not getting any younger .
She lives about twenty miles from Athens , and she thinks of me as a son .
Because I didn't want to watch while you gouged out his poor old eyes with your cruel fingernails , or while your vicious sister sank her fangs into his sacred flesh .
Are you still set on marrying my brother's daughter ?
And yet , words are a good thing when the man speaking them is pleasant to listen to .
In fact , she's crazed .
Good shining , Moon ! , Really , the Moon shines very well .
Which troupe is it ?
And even though Nature has given us the wit to have this argument , hasn't Fortune sent this fool here to stop us ?
Was that the prologue or the inscription on some wedding ring ?
What's this ?
She blushes at the slightest thing .
I know I may be old , but I'm strong and healthy , because in my youth I never drank nor lived recklessly .
As for me , I'll leave when I like .
My husband said she was unfaithful !
They were poisoned , then .
I will , my liege .
As for me , I'm surrendering all my power over to him , giving him absolute authority for the rest of his life .
First you taught me how to beg , and now I think you're teaching me how a beggar should be answered .
You !
Give me your hand .
Who is this fool ?
One creditor showed me a ring he got from your daughter in exchange for a monkey .
Yes , making a big fuss .
I'm very glad I came to see you .
Anyway , what's up ?
Oh God , Horatio , what a damaged reputation I'm leaving behind me , as no one knows the truth .
Now , my dear friend , what lucky wind blows you in from Verona ?
Look here , this is the entrance to his room .
Even though I don't see it , this lady thinks I'm a marvelously good-looking man .
Well , how nice , a riddle !
Please , tell us .
Unless I am mistaken , Signior Baptista may remember me from the Pegasus in Genoa , where we both stayed twenty years ago .
O , everlasting shame !
It is my rival for Bianca .
I haven't come to steal your loyalty , friends .
Sailors , sir .
Send something along to prove you're withdrawing the orders .
Oh , that's with worry .
Lady , did you sleep in her room last night ?
And his voice is the paramour of sweetness .
If it pleases you , your highness , will you lead us all inside ?
I'll tell him the news .
Their forces are nearby .
Good old knight , gather them all together at my tent .
I'll do that , because I have to tell my brother how you forgave him , Rosalind .
Oh , this day has turned into a disaster !
They deserved to keep their heads more than some people who have managed to keep their positions .
And me , too , my royal sovereign .
So I won't choose what many men desire , because I won't jump on the bandwagon and include myself with the whole crude population .
When I meet this gentleman , I'll tell him what you've said .
Why , sir , I spent it on this rope .
He's a proper count , that Count Sugarplum , a sweet gentleman , for sure !
He who chooses me will get what many men want." What many men want , that "many" could mean that most people are fools and choose by whatever is flashy .
I'm feeling very low , and I need to sleep .
Who's there ?
Poor Tom has been scared out of his mind .
I can swim like a duck , I swear .
Where are you going ?
It was urgent and important enough to require his personal presence .
I'm begging you .
If his face changed as much as his personality has , I wouldn't recognize him .
C'mon , make an effort .
Boys , how are you both doing ?
Sure , I hate her , but I wouldn't hurt her .
I loved one speech in particular .
Put your straw hats on , have some fun , and dance with these young nymphs .
A man named Taurus , they say .
What do you say ?
My meaning And I
You promised to take a full year off my sentence .
Ride , ride , Messala , ride , and give these dispatches to our forces on the other side .
Please don't be angry .
And that will save a partridge wing from being eaten , because he'll be too miserable for dinner .
I would whip a guy for making a tyrant sound too tyrannical .
I look forward to getting to know you better , Mr. Mustardseed .
But life itself , my wife , and the whole world aren't more valuable to me than your life is .
Goodbye , you dumb old spirit .
But she is wise .
Happy that we're not too happy , lucky in being not too lucky .
Calm down , Kate .
You got me , I admit it .
You haven't lost it unless you think you have .
I obey all your thoughts .
And you , sister ?
I've lost my name and title to a traitor .
Yes , that's me .
Sir , it's a troupe of actors who want to perform for your Lordship .
Who ever saw the heavens threaten like this ?
Goodbye , my Desdemona .
Oh , sir , on her nose , which is covered with pimples , sores , and red welts .
I'm watching the play .
Lay me next to my mistress .
He was in bed with , With her ?
I came here to tell you , I'll make this short , since she's already been talked about for too long , the lady is unfaithful .
I am not made of stone ; I am affected by all these kind pleas , though it goes against my conscience and my soul .
Yes , probably , because I'm staying for lunch .
What a lying , drunken monster .
Where else should his eyes be , if not in his head ?
I've gotten it dirty , ashes to ashes , and dust to dust .
Go back with her ?
Goodbye , Jessica .
Go look and then do the talking yourselves .
The flags have fallen .
Silly babbler , how you talk !
Mark Antony heard that you were preparing to wage war on him .
Take up the body .
Absolutely , he is stuffed , like a dummy .
We want to hear it , Antony .
The one who plays the part of the king will be particularly welcome .
A knight on a quest ?
I'll torment them all till they roar with pain .
You're a man ?
The one who makes her queen , of course .
You're giving him a present ?
How are things going now ?
You'll have wine enough , my lord , soon .
Live , live !
Make the best use of this information you can .
If they have done this thing , my noble lord , If ?
Let me go .
You too .
Your Honor's is unhealthy talk .
You're so neat and well put-together that you look like you love yourself more than anyone else .
So please , most gracious duke , order her to bring him out so we can get him some help .
It's Richard who sent us here to slaughter you .
They fled toward Peloponnesus .
She's gone .
Toward Chertsey , noble lord ?
I swear on my life , which I take pretty seriously , even if I am a magician .
There's no other shelter around here .
Indeed , Hero herself can !
Attack the breach in the city wall once more , dear friends , attack it once more , or else let's close it up with English corpses .
Horrid villain !
Hey !
My Lord of Norfolk , Here , most gracious king .
Noble Buckingham , your promise is like medicine to my ailing heart .
I'm sure he's out there dancing .
Call my guard , please .
Look out , he's coming !
If he's angry , there must be something seriously wrong .
What's more , people at the
Yours , Claudio , yours , I say .
Neither death nor life will stop me from coming .
People in high positions are shaken by many blasts of wind , and when they fall , they shatter into pieces .
I don't know why he's come here .
Look how the judge yells at a simple thief .
Hortensio , what's all this about ?
Why are the branches still living when the root is gone ?
Then say good-bye to me and tell me those tears were for my benefit .
You say you have news that's old ?
If it's okay with you , you should not press your grievances any further , but realize that the current situation should be enough to reconcile you .
He remembers how unkind he was to her , how he disowned her and sent her abroad , how he gave her rightful inheritance to her two dog-hearted sisters .
Gentle gods in heaven , please let me die .
True .
I can't help remembering the things that were most precious to me .
Malcolm !
Sorry , I'm all stuffed .
Shall I be tempted by the devil ?
It's driven me crazy .
Rogue , you've lived too long !
His messengers are waiting here to take me to him immediately , on pressing state business .
We'll chase 'em into their latrines .
But let me hear the letter from your friend .
Good , here's the stretcher .
Why are your swords out ?
Oh , it's too bad !
Isn't there a guard around ?
But in return , please , do one thing for me : leave me alone for a little while .
Where are you from ?
But tell us , did you hear anything about Antonio's loss at sea ?
You swore to me when I gave it to you that you would wear it till you died , and that it would be buried with you .
What's going on , Dromio ?
Is he right ?
Well , I'm not sorry to hear that , because they have always been my enemies .
Now , daughter Katherine ?
These are frightening odds .
If a man's brain were in his feet , wouldn't it be susceptible to frostbite ?
Oh , no .
This is my treasurer .
A thing of no importance .
He was crazy to run away .
So long .
He'll come right away .
Oh , she's a fine woman !
The dust from your attending troops should have risen to heaven .
What's wrong , Hecate ?
Lurk out of sight .
The hand of death has taken him .
It's nice to see children playing well together .
That's what I thought too , sir .
I take all responsibility for my decisions .
I'll vouch for that .
Who are the actors ?
I swear on my honor that we saw and heard Hero talking to a brute at her window last night .
What a wise judge !
Forgive me , darling Rosalind .
How goes the battle ?
Well , when I cut the egg in half and eat the whites , the yolk will be in two parts like two golden crowns .
Nice save !
Up and down , up and down , I will lead them up and down .
Greet the king with a welcoming expression in your eyes , your hands , and your words .
She confessed .
Oh , please let me .
Aren't you a rational human being ?
Your father would be a fool to give you all his wealth and spend his declining years as a guest in your house .
Do you recognize my voice , noble lord ?
How do you do , sir .
There are parents living whose children you have butchered ; they are now old withered plants who will moan over their losses as they grow old .
I love you so much that I'll send your soul to heaven very soon , if heaven will accept anything from me , that is .
God will revenge it .
We'll see you tomorrow .
Pull only his name out of his heart and let him go .
Yes , he was .
But let me try my luck on the boxes .
And her cook yelled , mocked , and teased me , right ?
Your grandsons will neigh to you like horses .
I'd better stop up my ears against this siren's song .
Take me to Octavius .
What man were you talking to at your window last night , between the hours of midnight and one ?
Oh , that's disgusting !
She was only dead , my lord , as long as her slander lived .
It's a messenger from the warships .
My lord Sebastian , even though what you say is true , your way of saying it is tactless and comes at the wrong time .
Welcome to Cyprus .
Oh , Bottom , you've changed !
Farewell , old man .
I just beg death to wait awhile , until I place the last of our many thousands of kisses on your lips .
About an hour for the ringing and fifteen minutes for the crying .
No I won't , even if you were one of the worst demons in hell .
In the meantime , be patient .
It's almost morning .
And you're all sizzle .
He'll stay as long as I say .
Then heaven have mercy on me .
Oh God !
A woman who doesn't know how to make her own indiscretions look like her husband's fault is hardly a woman .
We'll perform all the holy rites .
There are many troubles brewing now that have yet to become full-fledged threats .
Do tell .
Telling you where he's sleeping is like telling you where I'm lying .
Some people will laugh at anything , and others are so grouchy they won't even crack a smile when they hear something hysterically funny .
People don't cry when they're mocking someone .
We shouldn't make any judgments until we achieve our goal .
Women , dress me like a queen .
But you see my finger doesn't have the ring on it .
It seems to me that your voice has changed , and that your speech is more elegant than it used to be .
Is that true ?
Then tell me if Antonio can be called a brother .
What do you think you're doing ?
I know where she is and , if you don't mind , I will set her before you tomorrow , whole and unharmed .
You're not going , sir .
Where did they disappear to ?
But it's no treason for an Englishman to cut off a French crown , a head , I mean , and tomorrow the king himself will do some snipping .
Lay out the gown .
Don't take my love for granted .
Don't come in here , uncle !
Besides , you're a sponge !
I'm tired of it , and you say you're tired of it too .
Please give me a little credit !
Come , sit , sit , and sing me a song .
Sir , it's shaped like itself and is as wide as it has width .
Get ready , my lord .
Ask your daughters for another one .
Is his army approaching ?
I don't trust you .
Sir , I make my living using an awl .
I knew him when he listened to nothing but the military drum and fife ; now he would rather hear the sweet and refined music of the tabor and pipe .
What do you want ?
What can I do for you ?
Well , well , let's go .
If you really love me , you'll find me. , Nerissa and the rest of you , get away from him .
He calls me "boy" and scolds me as if he had the power to whip me out of Egypt .
Go get money .
What's the matter , dear ?
Regan , I hope you didn't know anything about that. , Ah , who's this ?
Well , hello there , Horatio !
I didn't have the heart to say no to him .
Didn't you go to her for a purse full of ducats ?
Good heavens , man , give them more than that !
You've stained your virtue with your own actions .
I know you can do better than that , but it'll do for now .
Therefore , tremble with fear and leave .
So you're around Lady Luck's waist ?
I meant they had to give her credit .
We've got it now. , Do you see this , my good fellow ?
Let life be short so that shame won't last too long .
Regret that your mouth betrayed your actions .
And now they're both gone .
Why ?
Don't even think about refusing .
We'll do what you want us to , my lord .
To save her life , I'll say she doesn't .
What , are you trying to make me crazy ?
The nobleman's are as huge as the underfed villager's .
We answered them , blow for blow .
I wish them all safe trips home .
She didn't ask anything ?
Servant monster" ?
I know it .
Gentlemen , gentlemen , Gentlemen , don't speak .
Yes , sweet Rosalind .
He's so flighty in his old age , as we keep noticing .
Get out !
And you say he's not jealous ?
That's the end of the announcement .
Come on , we have to follow the leaders of the dance .
Even the best jewel can be tarnished .
The gods are fair , and they use our little vices to punish us .
Speak plainly .
Give me some ink and paper .
What an idiot this guy is ! , You're a rotten piece of work ! , I beg your highness , beat him up and take his wine bottle from him .
Leave me .
Doesn't a Jew have hands , bodily organs , a human shape , five senses , feelings , and passions ?
Go around the forest , moving faster than the wind , and make sure you find Helena of Athens. , She's lovesick , and her face is pale from all the sighing she's been doing , because sighing is bad for the blood .
Carry him gently to bed , and every man be ready at his post when he awakes .
Someday you can get revenge. , Oh , you bastard !
The Prince has made the match , and may God bless it .
If I decide to get angry at you , just watch out , You'd be done for then , monster .
No , not me , sir .
What do you think about this change ?
Go then , goodbye .
In the same hour , and in the same inn , a poor woman also delivered identical twin boys .
For God's sake , would someone bring me a mug of beer !
Madam , if I do as well as I think I'm going to do in these dangerous , violent wars , you and your relatives will have more good at my hands than you've ever had bad !
Who's next ?
Please , somebody , get us out of here !
He was dressed like a hunter .
Antony's wife should have an army to escort her , with neighing horses to announce her arrival long before she appears .
He's shouting at the wind to blow the earth into the sea , or make the sea flood the earth , he wants to see the world return to primal chaos .
Thank you kindly , sir .
Good , good , I like that , it's only fair !
The only thing different about me is my clothes .
Farewell , King .
For that kind of relief , the patient must heal herself .
One criminal punishes another .
I'm killing myself with this provocative speculation.. .
Where is Montjoy , the herald ?
It doesn't get seen enough ; you should wear it in your cap , the way fools wear coxcombs .
It's amazing , if I may say so , that she let herself be tamed .
Let me take my chances .
Tell me , Othello .
The present time is like a woman in labor , each minute giving birth to some piece of news .
Well , sir , go inside .
You'll be my witness that I've been forced , as Pompey was , to wager all of our freedoms on one battle .
Actually , once or twice she sighed and said , "father , " as if the word were pressing on her chest .
What you just said may perhaps be true .
Don't speak any further .
I have drawn my sword .
Why did you leave me alone so unkindly ?
Soldiers , sir .
It's him , it's him .
Okay , I will , on Fridays and Saturdays , and the rest .
Don't be afraid , even though you see me with a weapon .
But look , even if my dishes are poor , eat them with my best wishes .
But I'm overjoyed !
Perhaps a woman's voice may do some good when some small detail proves to be holding things up .
This news is absolutely true : Mark Antony is expected to arrive in Rome at any hour now .
Is the king dead , the empire dispossessed ?
Now , Death , you can boast that you have an incomparable girl in your possession .
Caesar's talking .
Where's he going ?
He taught me how to recognize a man in love , and you're not a prisoner of love , I'm sure .
Two of them are completely honorable , and if they have been tricked in this , we must blame John the Bastard , who lives to create conflict .
Another hit .
The main body of the army is expected here any hour now .
Whether you bite to kill , Mastiff , greyhound , or ugly mutt ,
What , you ?
My granddaughter , with her kind aunt , the duchess of Gloucester , leading her by the hand ?
Bad friends were .
Isn't he a horrible man ?
Why , the one I just told you about .
He was perfect in everything .
From now on this is what I'll think of your love .
Come on , Casca , you and I will go see Brutus at his house before sunrise .
When we're born , we cry because we've arrived on the stage of life , like all the other fools .
If it's that important , then let the women die .
No , keep flattery for kissing the hands of those who can pay well .
Well , get out of here then !
Continue , then , and don't forget to perform all of the rituals .
Now come sing around the cauldron like a ring of elves and fairies , enchanting everything you put in .
Very serious , and I'm sure it's because of Beatrice .
Don't be quick to pick a fight , but once you're in one , hold your own .
Was he pale or flushed and red-faced ?
Oh , they continually urged the king to do it .
He's arrived .
That really is an illegitimate hope .
Let them come , I don't care .
Now I realize your brother tried to kill your father not just because your brother is an evil man , but because your father deserved it by being wicked himself .
Damn your mistress !
I'll come see you right away .
I thank you all .
But you would be more honorable if you changed your mind .
Murder has no tongue , but miraculously it still finds a way to speak .
Dromio , tell the servants to prepare for lunch .
And listen !
It would've been better for you not to have been born at all than to displease me as you did .
I'm starting to feel murderous urges .
Someone who was always near you .
Where's the king ?
Be lenient , dearest !
No , it's Casca , someone who's going to work with us .
Is there any natural cause for hardening of the heart ?
I heard him groan , yes , I did , and the same tongue that ordered the Romans to obey him and transcribe his speeches in their books cried , "Give me some water , Titinius , " like a sick girl .
A crow without feathers ?
By God !
Doesn't that make you want to cry ?
Were his wounds on his front side ?
Not many , and no one important .
Good evening to your Worship , good Captain James .
No , longer than that .
I doubt it , since you weren't even three at the time .
Well , by this I can see that you don't love me as much as I love you .
Isn't that strange ?
In the first act he is an infant , whimpering and puking in his nurse's arms .
By next week , I'll be able to pay you .
I've botched the job , friends .
Yes , my lord .
I didn't call you .
I think Belman is just as good , my lord .
Good morning to you , friend .
Thank you for that joke .
You can figure out the rest .
He's afraid to come in .
It's true I heard a humming sound , a strange one , which woke me up .
With all my heart. , Three or four of you go welcome him. , In the meantime , I'll read Bellario's letter out loud .
What , I have to hold a candle up so people can see what I'm doing ?
Oh , let their bodies follow , my dear king , to win back what's rightfully yours with blood and sword and fire .
I beg your pardon , except for the widow Dido .
Oh , there's been a lot of quarreling .
But that's not how you're going to be .
I'm not a traitor , unfair lady .
I remember he's already occupied .
Oh , no .
Is this true ?
Sir , let's get to the point .
Rage on , blow !
But look , Cassius , Caesar looks angry and everyone else looks as if they've been scolded .
I'll tell him , my lord .
Good-bye .
Say something !
No , she's worse : she's the devil's mother , and she comes to us disguised as an easy wench .
Stop , if you can't be kind , at least have some shame .
Let's go to him .
Dress me up in motley .
I know he holds me dear , but I haven't asked him about the coronation , and he hasn't told me .
Cambio .
Well then , tomorrow night , or Tuesday morning .
Where have you been , sister ?
I really think it was him .
What's your business ?
I'm reminding your grace what you promised me .
Our regiments are full to the brim ; our cause is ready .
My God , they've given me a lot to drink .
You look too much like the ghost of Banquo .
I hope to God Othello's all right .
My brave relative !
I swear , she's a very good-natured lady .
Goodbye , sir .
It makes me very happy to hear he's so interested .
I have responsibilities in this war , and as the absolute ruler of my kingdom I will carry out my duties as if I were a man .
But you're no such man .
Well , good for him !
Every minute we expect more ships to arrive .
Where are your leather apron and your ruler ?
And then you'll see that despite what you thought , I'll be as powerful as I was before .
But has Catesby gone ?
Because you're like the lowborn fellow who strikes the bell , you keep interrupting my thoughts .
We haven't even talked about who'll be our torchbearers .
He used to praise his mother's nipple before he sucked it .
May the gods be with you .
Leave her to God and her own guilt .
I'm telling you , I hardly know myself .
But I'll punish them thoroughly .
Friends of this country .
Oh , I followed something I'm ashamed to look at now !
What makes you say that ?
Where is Gloucester ?
I don't know whether he fought on Norway's side , or if he secretly aided the rebels , or if he fought with both of our enemies .
If you could only hear this testament , which , excuse me , I don't intend to read aloud , you would kiss dead Caesar's wounds and dip your handkerchiefs in his sacred blood , and beg for a lock of hair to remember him by .
He can't speak , my lord .
You've forgotten the will I told you about .
When beggars die there are no comets in the sky .
All I wanted to tell you is that the lantern is the moon , I'm the man in the moon , this thornbush is my thornbush , and this dog is my dog .
Harder , harder .
We thank your Honor .
I can't speak anymore .
You may , sir .
Give me my money and let me go .
They finished their business with Pompey , and Pompey has left .
Help me out of here , quickly !
Oh , wait , sir .
A sweet woman !
Don't tug on my clothes .
Officers , take them away .
Good-bye .
Where's the king ?
Everyone else , march on with me .
Take good care of him .
I swear I never hated you or your father !
But regarding what happened between us , don't ask , I can't tell you .
Goblin , lead them up and down .
Oh , let me kiss his hand !
Here comes a messenger .
Whoo-hoo !
The dirt of a grave must cover your sweet eyes !
Right on time .
I'm not dead ?
I'd give up my life and take my son's place in the mud on the ocean floor if I could see them alive in Naples. , When did you lose your daughter ?
Great kings of France and England , I owe you both equal service and loyalty .
But you're too good a friend for me to wish her on you .
Who's there ?
Go find him , please , and bring him to my tent .
I'll play the part wearing either a straw-colored beard , or a sandy beard , or a red beard , or one of those bright yellow beards that's the color of a French coin .
Wasn't he here ?
Aren't you my father ?
And I was just going to yours .
Please forgive me , master .
Amen .
I dreamed about an emperor called Antony .
Never .
Both of you are very welcome here .
Look , the precious Desdemona has arrived on shore .
Now that's patience !
If this is so , be patient , sister .
They've recorded my crimes , and I would rather die than have to retell this shameful story .
Quickly , quickly , good Iras , quickly .
The evil that men do is remembered after their deaths , but the good is often buried with them .
With anger , with fever , or with hunger , sure , my friend , but never sick with love .
Did I do anything good to myself ?
The priest is already there .
You'll grant me , you hedgehog ?
Everything may still be all right .
What prisoners of rank have been taken , uncle ?
Oh , Hamlet , how far she fell !
We'll win yet .
Is he married ?
Oh , why is this so ?
But stay calm , and don't get carried away by rage , or I'll think you're not a man .
What's this all about ?
Be patient with him , Brutus .
So get ready to cut off the flesh .
Why should men be more free than women ?
Why , you scoundrel !
He's dreaming .
Be gone !
Please , remain seated .
Are we all ready ?
He couldn't eat without me talking about it .
Even though everything evil wants to look good , good still has to look good too .
Well , until that time , don't come near me .
There aren't three people in all of Egypt who could do better .
And he had a chain that once belonged to you hanging around his neck .
Rest easy in the meantime .
Gravestones have been known to move , and trees to speak , to bring guilty men to justice .
I'm sure he had more hair on his tail than I have on my face when I last saw him .
That way I can conquer my own fear and sleep easy at night .
He pretended that everything was fine until the moment they were exchanging vows , and then , with public accusation , blatant slander , pure hatred , Oh God , if only I were a man !
Relax , gentlemen .
What's your message ?
Well , I'm nearly finished .
Caesar greets the Queen of Egypt and asks that you consider what you will ask from him .
Yes , the second time around , since , as they say , old people become children again .
And now I'm going to leave your despised company .
I never saw Cassio's kisses on her lips .
If I had only died an hour before this event I could say I had lived a blessed life .
You look tired .
Or is he walking ?
Which two crowns would those be ?
Really , I'm only pretending to be him .
It's not my fault he acts like that , Helena .
Before I learn how to love , I'll learn how to follow orders .
That's the one , sir .
Gracious King Edward has sent us noble Siward and ten thousand soldiers .
Goodbye .
Because we were unprepared for the king's visit , we weren't able to entertain him as well as we would have wanted to .
Get out of here , my friend .
I've set dangerous plans in motion , using lies , drunken prophecies , and stories about dreams to set my brother Clarence and the king against each other .
I'm happiest of all that I'm yours now , my lord , my king , and you can guide me as you wish .
I know you have no choice .
Yes , every inch a king .
Have Lucius and Titinius guard the door .
Quiet , you stupid fool .
Oh , please be quiet .
No , Cassio wasn't killed .
I'm telling you , you jerk priest , my sister will be an angel in heaven while you're howling in hell .
It isn't proper for you to know how much Caesar loved you .
If I can disguise my voice as well as my appearance , then I'll be able to carry out my plan perfectly .
Should I get your nightgown ?
When did I ever do you any harm ?
I can't watch any more .
Oh , you villain !
This was the noblest Roman of them all .
Eat your dinner and pay no attention to him .
Aren't these woods less perilous than the court , with all its jealousies and intrigues ?
His military ability is double that of the other two .
Listen !
So young , my lord , and honest .
So go ahead and cry .
He's waiting outside .
Here they come .
Cassius , stand firm .
But what about Cicero ?
Go .
But he kept chattering so foolishly , talking about you in such insulting and despicable terms , that it was hard for me to restrain myself .
True , if a fool such as yourself could find it .
When Roscius was an actor in ancient Rome , The actors have arrived , my lord .
Lucius , who's that knocking ?
Tell her to put her mind at rest .
What is a traitor ?
Get some light !
Now that I think about the danger of these knights , if you come to stay with me , please bring no more than twenty-five of them with you .
Wake up , sir , wake up .
I think of as many things as he does , but I just thank heaven and don't show off about it .
All right , my lord. , How's the king doing ?
Oh , ho !
I wish I had two fool's caps and two daughters .
I'll talk to you more about this some other time .
One of them contains my picture .
For God's sake , my lord , let's be sure to be part of the group that meets the prince .
No , sir .
He's my prisoner and you can't have him .
Isn't it completely moral to kill him now with this sword , and an easy conscience ?
You may think that I don't love you .
The moon sets at twelve , right ?
These corpses suggest mayhem .
I'm off .
I'll see you on the guards ' platform between eleven and twelve tonight .
And let no one suffer for this deed except us , the perpetrators .
She'll find out soon enough by one of our messengers how respectfully and kindly we plan to treat her .
If you're Stephano , touch me and speak to me .
Then we'll call this the Battle of Agincourt , fought on the day of Crispin Crispianus .
We heard it very clearly .
It's better here than outside .
I am dying , Cleopatra , dying .
He thinks he's still playing his instrument .
Here he comes with Captain Jamy , the Scots captain .
What do you say now ?
Welcome home , Grumio .
I know she trusts you and tells you everything .
Oh , my lord , you once said that lazy weeds grow fast .
For Brutus , as you know , was Caesar's angel .
Me neither .
And we'll leave together , like friends .
It was some devil .
He can't bear his grief and so he's losing his mind .
Where's that dog ?
Demetrius loves her , and he doesn't love you .
who can control his fate ?
Did you inform them of that ?
First rehearse your song from memory , and make sure each note is pretty .
I've never heard such confused emotions as what that Jew dog was shouting in the streets .
From our brother monarch , the king of England ?
You may hear about it soon .
Then you would have to go beyond heaven , beyond earth .
I must be gone .
Is it not enough , is it not enough , young man , that I'll never be pretty enough to get a kind look from Demetrius ?
Go , coward that you are .
I will .
Killing pigs .
You'll be lord of the island then , and I'll be your servant .
Go on , take them .
I could have saved her .
I have come here to bury Caesar , not to praise him .
You'd better go inside .
I will do this deed before I lose my sense of purpose .
That's a deal .
The British forces are on their way here .
Really , I had no intention of going for my sword .
The rain , the wind , the thunder and lightning are not my daughters .
What horrible thing are you imagining ?
No , I'm sure it has , Volumnius .
By watching their show , you'll find out everything you're likely to know .
No , just to the gates of hell , where the devil will meet me , with the horns on his head like a cuckold , and say , "Go up to heaven , Beatrice .
When Jacob took care of his uncle Laban's sheep , Jacob was the heir to his grandfather Abraham's birthright , because his mother cleverly arranged for her husband Isaac to make Jacob his heir , What's your point ?
Come on .
When they choose , they only know how to lose .
Now he's telling the story .
I'll tell you at a better time .
Seleucus' ingratitude makes me wild .
He has , my lord .
The wisdom of your loyalty , fair Bianca , has cost me a hundred crowns since dinner .
Give me details .
And yet , against all odds , I win her over !
That's right , she did .
Now , Roderigo , where did you see her ? , Oh , that miserable wretch ! , You say you saw her with the Moor ? , Oh , who would want to be a father ? , How did you know it was her ? , To think she tricked me so easily ! , What did she say to you ? , Get me more candles , and wake up all my relatives .
I will accept no apology until experts in matters of honor show me how to make peace with you without staining my own reputation in doing so .
My lord , His Majesty wanted me to tell you that he's placed a large bet on you .
Swear by my sword .
Nor living ones , I hope .
If each grain of sand had a tongue to eulogize , my horse would be a topic for them all .
I'm speaking purely in analogies and comparisons .
I don't know what you're talking about .
Even more since you annexed my father's house and lands .
If someone like me is fit to be king , let me know .
You said it when you were furious .
Are you going to write Antony about this ?
Everyone .
Caesar's better qualities exist in Brutus , and we will crown him .
No .
And in the morning I'll take you to your ship and we'll sail to Naples , where I hope to see this loving couple married .
I won't have any of this .
Very good !
Talkers aren't good doers .
Then he's the whining schoolboy , with a book bag and a bright , young face , creeping like a snail unwillingly to school .
Doesn't a Jew have eyes ?
I'll go and coach them .
You take my life when you take away my means of making a living .
Lord Mayor , the reason we have sent , Look behind you !
You're a villain to say this about me .
Yes , by God , that it is .
When the poor cried , Caesar cried too .
If you hope to have your sins forgiven by Christ's dear blood , which He shed for our terrible sins , you must leave and keep your hands off me .
Pluck off colorful butterfly wings , and use them to fan moonbeams away from his eyes as he sleeps .
What's the news ?
Even if she lives till the end of the world , she'd keep burning an additional week .
Should I go convince my daughter to marry you ?
Thank you , sir .
No , no , with God's help , his son will be king .
That's comforting .
Heaven knows what he's going to do with it .
This storm has no pity for either wise men or fools .
My life has run its circle .
Excuse me , my lord ?
It's too hot .
What time is it ?
Twenty-five , sir .
I wish you could tell him I saved his brother .
Keep my cups full and treat me as you did when my empire was one of your fellow servants , obeying my commands .
Then let God grant me that you'll be damned for that wicked deed .
I'm now sure that every bump in the road has been removed .
I swear by my sword , which killed the Shah of Persia and a Persian prince and defeated the Sultan Suleiman three times , that I would face the meanest-looking warriors on earth .
It was me , no one else .
They did , Fluellen .
Do you really mean that ?
The things men are allowed to do !
Yes , my lord , I played the part of a gossip and brought him the news .
Good-bye .
Oh , if only my smiles could inspire love as effectively as your frowns !
Let's follow the music as far as we can without leaving our station and see if it stops .
In my soul , I believe Hero has been falsely accused .
But how wonderful that she should be so fond of Signior Benedick , whom she has always appeared to hate .
CALIBAN Stephano !
Where is he ?
Risk everything for lead ?
Whom you swore you would protect and defend .
Get up and listen to me .
If everyone here knows us but we don't know anybody , it's time , I think , for us to pack our bags and take off .
Your superiors .
I won't lodge any more than that under my roof .
Slay !
All ladies love me , except you .
The gods forbid !
I think it's later than that , sir .
I don't know .
you , as sure as your name's Roderigo , if I were the Moor I wouldn't want to be Iago .
I suspect his friends will join us .
Give me your present to give to Master Bassanio .
Didn't you talk to it ?
Go then , slave .
What "passion" ?
Write to him immediately .
What's this , you dog ?
Squabbling ?
For three months .
All the most beautiful paintings Are black when compared to Rosalind .
Listen !
You'll be my wife , dearest , and I'll serve you forever .
I'm serving under him to take advantage of him .
That whore ?
Now you have only the memory of what you were , which tortures you when you consider what you've become .
I know where I'll wear this dagger , then .
I can't find anyone who saw her leave .
He's lying dead in a ditch , with twenty deep gashes in his head , any one of which would have been enough to kill him .
It's worthless .
I have no opinion about him .
I'd rather break my own heart .
She's Phoebe-ing me .
Yes , gentle cousin , if it were light enough for you .
I want you to do some things for our wedding , and I also want to discuss something that concerns you both .
What's that ?
Yes , he knew about it the whole time .
Why is Time so cheap about giving out hair ?
And the boys are winning so far ?
Grumio gave the order for how it should be done .
You don't wish we had more help from England anymore , cousin ?
Nonsense !
Why , sir , must he ?
But Edward is still alive .
She shall be buried next to her Antony .
Why the nobles were imprisoned , and on what charges , I don't know , my gracious lord .
And , Kate , when France is mine and I am yours , then France is yours and you are mine .
Become a better
Go , hurry .
Please go .
Then there would be two cousins lying sick in bed : one hurt by reasons and the other gone crazy without any .
Our shipwreck has made more women widows in Milan and Naples than there are survivors to comfort them .
Did old Bellario send you here ?
If our secret's known , either Caesar or I will die , for I'll kill myself .
The duke went with him to search Bassanio's ship .
I know a thousand immature tricks like that , and I'll use them all .
It's nice you're offering to sacrifice her behind her back .
Find out where the Jew's house is .
I'll remember .
And even though I'm in a distasteful mood , I'll work on being happy .
My thoughts were never on money .
If you shut the windows , it will pour out the keyhole .
When we love our job we get up early and go to it joyfully .
That's not the tune I had in mind .
Too late , good Diomedes .
Tell him I've spoken to my husband on his behalf , and I think everything will be all right .
I'm tired of you .
Yes , one , and this is how I did it .
That's why your daughter and son-in-law are punishing me shamefully .
I don't have the proud melancholy of a courtier or the ambitious melancholy of a soldier or the calculated melancholy of a lawyer .
This isn't the death of one man .
Your doctors have expressly forbidden me to sleep with you , as there's a risk that you might have a relapse .

He'll think these letters are from Olivia and that she's in love with him .
I'll help you .
Well , God is responsible for that , not me , and he deserves thanks .
If you leave like this , my dear , I won't ever use my sword again .
But you'd still be gorgeous even if you were as proud as the devil .
I'll tell them where you come from , though I don't know who you are or what you want .
I'm not insane , Sir Topas .
These two people are as identical as two halves of an apple .
Your lord knows what I think .
Hello , sweet lady .
Has anyone seen Cesario ?
I certainly will , sir .
Yes , but now there's no way to calm him down .
What do you think of this fool , Malvolio ?
You lie .
I wouldn't even pee without dancing a waltz .
I can do anything !
Yes , you have to tell us why , Sir Andrew .
Stop , Sir Toby !
Haven't you totally dismissed my honor and integrity in your anger ?
What a pretty picture , three fools all together .
What do you mean by that , Malvolio ?
Here come the conspirators .
Go to him , Sir Topas .
Why are you acting so brazen toward my lady ?
How unbelievable !
Well , I'll commit the sin of double-dealing , and deal you a second coin .
A good person who does something wrong is only patched up with sin .
I'm telling you , this house is dark .
Don't you think you should go to bed , Malvolio ?
I may command the one I love." Well , she commands me .
Tomorrow you need to get more money sent to you .
Who did this , Sir Andrew ?
He must've heard that phrase describing some great man and now he's using it on a jester .
Because then I'd have to shed an ounce or two of your impudent blood .
What's the matter ?
Fool !
Run after that obnoxious messenger , the duke's servant .
If that means I don't care about anything , you should disappear right now , since you're nothing .
But now we don't have to !
Can someone fall in love this quickly ?
I can make my handwriting look just like Lady Olivia's : she
Oh , hello , father !
Someone adored me once , too .
Who said that ?
He's furious because you insulted him , and he has a right to satisfaction .
Show me the way .
What's the matter with you ?
He'll release him .
But I don't get it , what's the joke ?
Hello , my friends !
He called me Sebastian .
There was no story , my lord .
That's a nice hand you dealt me .
Now that I think about it , Maria was the one who first told me you were insane .
Oh , go away , you're a boring fool .
Look out for him in the corner of the orchard as if you were a sheriff's deputy .
My Cesario ?
I'll bet anything you like that nothing will happen , once again .
I'm being gentle with you , because I'm one of those good-hearted people who are polite to the devil himself .
It doesn't need to be witty as long as it's eloquent and imaginative .
Goodbye .
I'll have you two hide , and the fool too , right where he'll find the letter .
Why , sweetheart ?
Oh , it sounded like a sweet breeze blowing gently over a bank of violets , taking their scent with it .
Although many people said she looked like me , she was considered beautiful .
Give me too much of it , so I'll get sick of it and stop loving .
My message is not for anyone else to hear , my lady .
A gentleman ?
You have to come with me .
It's my duty to be quiet .
I'm coming , don't worry .
Well then , goodbye .
Won't we , Sir Andrew ?
Thanks for your trouble .
If I didn't have so many enemies in Orsino's court , I'd go join you there .
We thought he was a coward , but he fights like a devil .
Anyone who refuses to drink to my niece until his brain spins around like a merry-go-round is scum .
His breath stinks .
And some have greatness thrust upon them." Heaven help you !
It was a total fluke that you yourself were saved .
Sebastian was my father's name , and my brother was named Sebastian too .
What do you want ?
Give me my veil .
At least tell me where you're going .
Come along with us , Signor Fabian .
While I waited , I'd frown impatiently , and perhaps wind my watch , or play with my , with some expensive piece of jewelry I happen to be wearing .
Leave them alone until he sets off home , and then follow him .
Well , my friends praise me and make me look like an idiot , while my enemies tell me straightforwardly that I am an idiot .
Will either of you give him the message that I'm challenging him to a duel ?
Oh , my poor brother !
My enemies help me understand myself better , which is an advantage , and my friends help me lie about myself , which is a disadvantage .
Where is Malvolio ?
And you can't deny evidence and argument , They've been around since Noah's ark .
This is going to be great !
Was he sent by Count Orsino ?
If only his lord were more like him .
What's his name ?
I am still so faithful , my lord .
One face , one voice , one way of dressing , but two people !
I can hardly keep myself from throwing things at him .
My boy , it's true .
My lord loves you .
There's a picture of me inside .
What would you do about it ?
Yes , that's the one .
In what chapter and verse of his heart ?
No , sir .
Yes , madam .
If you want things done in the right way , you'll have to let me read a crazy letter in a crazy voice .
Why are you leaving , my angry friend ?
I'd follow you to the gates of Hell , you sneaky little devil !
Then you really are insane , if you're no saner than a fool .
What is fated to happen must happen .
You should have a guard nearby if he comes in here , because he's clearly disturbed .
I'll sue him for assault and battery , if there's any justice in Illyria .
Good , very good .
Well , her name's a word , and if you fooled around with it you might make her into a whore .
Don't ask to see this letter .
Besides , she treats me more respectfully than the other servants .
She's a lot like you .
So if four negatives make two affirmatives , I'm worse off because of my friends and better off because of my foes .
Ah-ha !
Are you ready , sir ?
Oh , you're a clergyman ?
What do you say to that , Malvolio ?
No , madam .
And when he strikes back at you , he'll hit you as sure as you're standing there .
Yes , but I know , What do you know ?
Sad , my lady !
What else could you possibly think of me ?
How did you divide yourself in two ?
No , not at all .
Believe me , I'm not .
You're a smart guy .
No , my lord , not me .
But if it's not double-dealing , sir , I wish you'd deal me another .
The door's right here .
How strange I'm feeling !
Please go inside .
Yes , my lord .
Oh , Antonio , I'm sorry I caused you so much trouble .
You'd be the funniest person in Illyria, if Sir Toby ever stopped drinking .
No , the legs and thighs .
Ready to set sail , sir ?
Actually , their hearts are as sensitive and loyal as ours are .
Now talk to him in your own voice , and tell me how he is .
Well , that proves she's in love with you .
He abandoned his friend here in an emergency , and even pretended he didn't know him .
You're smiling ?
Oh , I'll beat him up for that !
I'm surprised you enjoy the company of this stupid troublemaker .
I'll give it back to you .
Weren't we both born under Taurus ?
I think you're right , sir .
Here it is .
Never trust me again if I don't .
Apparently you think there's nothing unusual about a bloody head .
Oh , he looks like a pathetic Sunday school teacher .
He's really taken this prank to heart .
Be a nice fool and help me find a candle and some paper .
You'll introduce me to him as a eunuch .
He really was tricked horribly .
Go away .
My lord acts just as crazy with love as you do .
Cesario , go visit that cruel Olivia one more time .
But I'll get you a candle and paper and ink .
Oh , I've read that .
Calm down , calm down .
But wait , there's some prose after her poem .
My name is Mary , sir .
I order you to stop !
No , I don't know you , and my lady didn't send me to get you , and I'm not supposed to tell you to come speak with her , and your name is not Master Cesario , and this is not my nose , either .
I'll let you get away with skipping the praise .
Oh , I remember that very clearly !
I think his soul's in hell , my lady .
How is that possible ?
And maybe a third ?
I'm everywhere .
That was excellent , really excellent .
Excuse me , weren't you with Countess Olivia just now ?
Sir Toby , madam , your relative .
If God had been willing , I wish we had died in the same hour too !
Listen , I'm going home tomorrow , Sir Toby .
What was the philosopher Pythagoras's belief about wild birds ?
I'd bet my life that , as young as you are , you've fallen in love with someone .
I was born and raised less than three hours from here .
It's true she looked at me a lot , in fact , she looked at me so much that she seemed distracted , and couldn't really finish her sentences very well .
It's possible , ma'am .
For God's sake , shut up !
But who is this person , sir ?
Oh , Lord !
Get to the point now .
I'm just wandering , with no particular destination .
No , sir , worse off .
I've heard her say that .
Anyone who says you're a man must not notice how young you are .
You're wrong , you madman .
I would've given it to you this morning , but a madman's letters aren't Gospel , so it doesn't matter much if I'm a bit late .
No , sir , not at all .
Nice and short and full of good sense , or should I say nonsense ?
So let her execute me .
I'll go back inside and ask the lady for some kind of escort .
The police are here .
He's conducting some business with my lady , and sooner or later he'll leave .
No , I won't stay a second longer .
But come on , start .
Are you making all this noise at this time of night because you have no manners , or because you're just stupid ?
I swear I will , Come on , let's go see what happens .
Get me some ink , paper , and a candle .
I know that my lady's going to end up hitting him .
I'll follow the priest and go with you ; and after I've sworn to be faithful , I'll be faithful forever .
Fool , I say !
If you were a woman , I'd hug you now and cry , and say "Welcome back , drowned Viola ! " My father had a mole on his forehead .
I don't care if all the devils in hell crammed together to possess him , I still want to speak to him .
I swear , this fool has an excellent singing voice .
I've never seen such a monster .
Husband ?
I told you , someone's at the gate .
Don't give up yet .
Me too .
By the way , I'm going home tomorrow , Sir Toby .
And I beg you , please come here again tomorrow .
Yes , but who is he ?
He must be possessed by the devil .
And when she does , he'll imagine she's flirting with him .
If that's true , which it is , she might as well be in love with a dream , the poor lady .
In fact , I'd do even more to him than what you've heard him promise to do .
Love is so vivid and fantastical that nothing compares to it .
Your fate awaits you .
How are you , my friend ?
Just imagine some lady might exist who loves you as powerfully and agonizingly as you love Olivia .
Leave me alone .
You don't know me .
I hope she doesn't have a crush on me !
They say he used to fence for the shah of Persia .
I'd hate to waste my speech on the wrong person , because It's very well written and I spent a lot of time and energy memorizing it .
Absolutely , you idiot .
This is Illyria , lady .
We human beings don't control our own destinies .
He claimed he knew that , and that's why he's come to speak with you .
Let me see you dance .
I can't love him .
You can speak to me .
She's been drowned in salty sea water , and now my salty tears are about to drown her memory all over again .
Then you're a fool for being sad that your brother's soul is in heaven .
Take him away .
I'll only admit that you're sane when you agree with Pythagoras and hesitate to kill a bird because it might contain your grandmother's soul .
My friends , are you all Lady Olivia's servants ?
Ah , I'm an odd kind of guy .
So listen up , princess .
Yes , dear little chick , come along with me. , Shut up , man !
Maria !
Here comes the man who rescued me , sir .
Cesario is my name , your servant's name , fair princess .
Hello , you idiot .
Sometimes I think I'm no smarter than average .
My legs may be yellow , but I don't feel blue .
Yes , she saw me quite clearly .
That's excellent .
Please let me be your servant so I can be with you .
You should have run up to her , unleashed a few excellent quips invented on the spot , and rendered the young man speechless .
Here he is , here he is .
God bless you , my friend , and your music too .
Women are like roses : the moment their beauty is in full bloom , it's about to decay .
If you love me , let me know by smiling at me .
He's just as terrified of Sir Andrew .
Sweet Sir Andrew !
Then lead the way , father .
He insists he'll speak with you whether you want him to or not .
Excellent !
Is that really what you meant ?
Antonio , you're under arrest on the orders of Count Orsino .
That means it's more likely to be fake .
Yes , good fool .
Oh , I'd never be that cruel .
Orsino , this is the same Antonio who took the
Wind and rain can't wash it off .
Who , Sir Andrew Aguecheek ?
Fabian can hardly control him over there .
You know , he got me in trouble with the lady of the house once when I arranged a bear-baiting here .
He's a good-looking young man , and there are a lot of people with him .
Sir , you need a drink .
I'm no more insane than you are , and I'll prove it .
If you're someone who gets into fights , I'll fight with you .
Fight to the death" is his motto .
No .
I'd give half my dowry to keep anything bad from happening to him .
Hello , sir .
M" , why , that's the first letter in my name .
Get that fool out of here .
I could be sad if I wanted to be .
No woman is strong enough to put up with the kind of intense passion I feel .
Nothing is what it is .
Easily , madam .
A good fool .
My lady Olivia's inside , sir .
I mean please go into the house , sir .
He talks nothing but nonsense .
Do you make your living by playing that drum ?
I represent her .
What ?
Open it and read it .
He cut my head and gave Sir Toby a bloody head , too .
He couldn't see you .
Then don't make yourself too conspicuous .
I can't let my lips say his name ; "No man must know."
Please , keep it to yourself .
She's a fine woman , all right .
I wish I could work for that lady !
That's what she was expecting , and you let her down .
In Orsino's heart .
In his heart ?
I'm not holding your hand , sir .
Who's talking to him now ?
You'll get a bigger reward than you ever got delivering a letter before .
Honestly , sir , I'd need to use words to explain why , and since words are so unreliable and false , I'd rather avoid using them in a serious discussion .
You're all lazy and shallow .
That's the truth .
Good night .
We respected the beat of the song , sir .
You're wrong about that , I assure you .
But please forgive me , darling , for the sake of the vows we made to each other so recently .
I refuse to accept that .
Be the person you know you are , and you'll be as powerful as this person you fear .
Which one is Sebastian ?
What are you going to do ?
Is it possible ?
Show him in .
The captain who brought me to shore has my women's clothes .
Are you always going to be like this ?
If you let her go this easily , Sir Andrew , you don't deserve to ever use your sword again .
My girlfriend has beautiful white hands , and great warriors aren't Ha , ha !
What , faithful to being mean and nasty ?
Here comes the little villain herself .
Sometimes all I want to do is see plays and go out dancing .
I'll give him my gray horse Capilet if he forgets the whole thing .
So I'll be forced to call you a jerk , Sir Andrew .
Ah , no .
I saved his life and gave him my love , without reservation .
It's my master who's not getting the reward he deserves , not me .
Oh , beautiful and accomplished lady , may the heavens rain odors upon you !
I don't think a team of oxen could get them close enough to fight .
Get him to say his prayers , Sir Toby , get him to pray .
Give me your hand , sir .
Then he's no good .
Not bad ; you might accomplish something .
Good .
They eat too much and get indigestion and nausea .
No , sir .
He'll tell you more of the story .
Has your lord given you any orders to negotiate with my face ?
If a bloody head counts as a hurt , then you hurt me .
Some achieve greatness , " What are you saying ?
Come on , Sir Andrew , there's nothing you can do about it .
You can do whatever you want as long as it's socially appropriate .
The whole quarrel might have been resolved since then when we repaid what we stole from them , which most of our city did , for the sake of friendly trade relations .
Be loud and obnoxious .
Just think , I could be Count Malvolio !
This man is probably like that .
What can I say to him , lady ?
Are you always so funny ?
What's wrong with you ?
What's the obvious conclusion from that ?
Shut up , you troublemaker , no more of that .
Look , here comes the fool .
He's somewhere else in the house .
I was never a thief or a pirate , though I admit I was your enemy for good reasons .
Madam , I will .
Or I'll deliver your insults to his face .
I'll help you , Sir Toby .
Go where , my lord ? , Cesario , my husband , stay here .
Malvolio , your vanity is damaging your good taste .
She took that ring from me .
But if I shake it up a little it'll work , because every one of those letters is in my name .
Set him free .
You might have a great opportunity to give it to him right now .
My brother is in heaven .
What do you want to say , sir ?
I'll hold on to your money and leave you for an hour .
Get the lady out of here .
rules my life." Hmm , let me see , let me see , let me see .
Hide behind the boxwood hedge , all three of you .
You're making a terrible racket out here !
Draw your sword and get on your toes , because your assailant is quick , skillful , and deadly .
That's true .
I've been so tortured since I lost track of you !
Oh , you're a naughty one , encouraging double-dealing .
My dear Miss Chat-her-up , I look forward to getting to know you better .
Like medicine for a sick man .
No , he just smiles .
Come on , sir , let's go .
I sent for you about a sad occasion .
I could really use his advice right now .
Are you good at those kinds of things ?
Is it that aggressive ?
Here's some money for you .
It doesn't sound as sweet as it did before .
By God , I'll go after him again and beat him up .
They're good enough to drink in , and so are these boots .
Good fool , good jester , I'll make it worth your while if you get me a candle , and a pen , ink and paper .
Hunting what , Curio ?
Where's my cousin Toby ?
God will protect me .
Go ahead .
Are you an actor ?
I am the only daughter in my father's family , and all the brothers too , but I'm not completely sure about that .
Besides , you've gotten unreliable .
I'm not interested in being good .
What could you possibly ask of me that I wouldn't give you , as long as it didn't damage my honor and self-respect ?
What kind of woman is she ?
I couldn't stay behind after you left .
Madam , I will .
Come with me , boy .
Or are you just pretending ?
Which one of you is the lady of the house ?
I give you my obedience and my humble service , madam .
Don't worry about me not swearing enough .
You've made him so delusional he'll go crazy when he learns the truth .
Here's money for you .
A duke who is noble in name and character .
Next time God sends out a shipment of hair , I hope he gives you a beard !
But what's he like ?
Are you insane ?
I never hurt you .
Wow , we're really going to drive him crazy .
Should we sing a round to wake up the night owl ?
Please , and I'll pay you plenty for this , help me conceal my identity , and find me the right disguise so I can look the way I want .
I'm going to Count Orsino's court .
Well , he keeps the devil away as well as a man can in his situation .
I won't take it back .
I'm a gentleman .
Here , take this piece of jewelry .
If I miss this , let me be boiled alive .
You seem to be a good person , captain , and although people who look beautiful are often corrupt inside , I believe that you have a beautiful mind to go with your good looks and manners .
How are you , Sir Toby Belch ?
Then I'll pay you for doing what you like .
It's half of all my money .
Orsino .
Are you Sebastian ?
If he can not , let the tailor mend him .
Let me enjoy my privacy .
Now , you lie there on the path .
Where , good Miss Mary ?
What's going on , Malvolio ?
Gentleness is the only way to go , gently , gently .
A love song , a love song .
That our grandmother's soul could end up inhabiting a bird .
All I know is that staying up late is staying up late .
Tell me that .
This is the air , that's the glorious sun .
Can't you talk about anything besides ladies ?
Who was it ?
God bless you , Mr .
You've made up your mind , then ?
You speak so highly of fools !
How does he love me ?
And I would die a thousand deaths cheerfully , if it made your life easier .
But silence , like a knife , cuts open my heart With strokes that draw no blood .
Should we go see the sights in the town ?
But I'll open the curtain and let you see the picture .
Get him to bed and make sure his wounds are treated .
I'm coming in peace .
Thank you .
Mine did too .
By my birth I rank above you , but don't be afraid of my greatness .
An angel is walking on earth .
Fool !
I was the only one who refused to give back what I stole .
Nothing can come between me and the fulfillment of all my hopes .
If that's true , I think the same thing about you .
There's something going on that's not what it seems .
Look at me now !
Stay right here and try to look good .
I swear to God , madam , you've wronged me , and I'll tell the whole world .
He's only known you for three days , but he's already treating you like a close friend .
I'm not bringing any declarations of war or demands for cash .
It must be something I did accidentally .
Never .
What ?
I think I saw you there , you wise man .
So cheer up , there's still hope for you , man .
I swear , anyone smart who laughs at these courts jesters is nothing but a jester's apprentice .
Just come again tomorrow .
M" , Malvolio .
This precious little guy is putty in your hands , Sir Toby .
I will .
I defy brain-death !
You've never seen anything like it .
Are you her husband , boy ?
She said if she were interested in someone , it would be someone who looked like me .
That's true .
I know his soul's in heaven , fool .
So go out there and give him what he wants .
All the rest of you can leave too .
Malvolio's coming down the path .
Please , sir , be quiet .
Stay in the dark .
This guy's wise enough to play the fool , and only clever people can do that .
Fabian , bring him here .
I'll come too .
I've only made it this far since I left her place , walking at a moderate pace .
My lord , I swear to you , Oh , don't swear !
You should be ashamed of yourself , Satan , you liar !
creet .
My lady told me to tell you that while she lets you stay at her house because you're a relative , she doesn't approve of your behavior .
Shouldn't she just accept that ?
Tell me what you want .
And what's her story ?
Just read it .
Are you the lady of the house ?
It was addressed to him , and orders must be obeyed .
Well then , sing a lullaby to your generosity : it'll nap until I come back .
If you're my friend , you'll let me see his letter .
Thanks for telling me .
You too , Fabian .
Go take care of him .
Sir Topas , Sir Topas !
I'm not such an idiot that I can't keep my hands dry .
It's as all-consuming and insatiable as the sea , and it can swallow as much as the sea can .
Don't compare a woman's love for a man with my love for Olivia .
I'll get back at him another way .
Oh , I thank my lucky stars , I'm so happy .
Go back to your lord .
Do you think you've got a couple of fools on your hands here ?
I was telling you to go after her , woo her , confront her .
As for his thoughts , I wish he'd think about nothing at all rather than think about me all the time .
I wish you'd do what I ask !
I'm in so much trouble with my niece that it wouldn't be safe to let this prank go to its conclusion .
Andrew Aguecheek"
Cesario , you missed your appointment with me .
She's the reason I'm here .
I bet you're a happy fellow who doesn't care about anything .
But my hair looks good anyway , doesn't it ?
How tragic !
I don't know what I'm doing .
But it has bay windows that are as transparent as stone walls , and the upper windows facing south-north are as clear as coal .
If you've offended him , I'll fight you .
Blab my nonsense !
Who are you ?
I wish this trick would be over .
Why do you hide these things ?
Come on , put your sword away , my little soldier .
I tell you , I'm as sane as any man in Illyria .
Just a bit of my dry humor , sir .
Look , sir , this is a portrait of me as I am at this particular moment .
Tell her my love is purer than anything else in the whole world , and has nothing to do with her property .
Keep myself ?
You'll know more about it later .
That's a good thing to put in , it keeps you from getting in trouble with the law .
I'm not like you .
Is he talking nonsense ?
The house will be so much quieter .
When has anyone ever put you down like that .
Only really cruel people can be called deformed .
You can ride him easily , and he responds well when you pull the reins .
Anyway , what should we do ?
For her I'll be strange and condescending , and I'll put on my yellow stockings and crisscross laces right away .
Shall I be your slave ?
Who I am and what I want are a secret .
I told him you were asleep .
If you're just insane , then get out of here .
I'm listening to you only because I've got nothing better to do .
Goodbye .
His eyes started glazing over around eight in the morning .
Sir Topas !
Come on , Sir Andrew .
I don't know what else it could be .
Bring us some wine !
Dear Sir Toby , don't do anything rash tonight .
Dear Mr. Fabian , do me another favor first .
I don't believe it .
I told him you were sick .
Chat her up , Sir Andrew .
And wanted to see you with laces crisscrossed over your legs." Crisscrossed ?
But then he said strange things to me .
Oh , I really think she loves me !
Haven't you , boy ?
I remember .
For the love of God , call a doctor !
They certainly will .
That's why I wish my sister didn't have a name , sir .
That's it !
Here comes Sir Toby , limping .
Come , put it over my face .
Taste your legs , sir .
Neither would I .
That's definitely too old .
Why not ?
Sir Toby , I've got to be frank with you .
I'll have to do something courageous then , because I hate intrigue .
But tell me honestly , are you sure you're not insane ?
But there was a rumor , you know , people always gossip about royalty , that he was in love with the beautiful Olivia .
Let's go .
Do you have anything else to say ?
Wow , he's a real devil .
Do you even know what you're talking about ?
Oh ho !
How are you ?
The devil inside him is rough , but we can't treat it roughly .
I can't remember anything I've ever done to offend anyone .
Listen , if you want a good laugh , and I mean a side-splitting one , then follow me .
Madam , that young man out there says he's got to speak to you .
Why don't you go off to church dancing one way , and come home dancing another way ?
Isn't he getting funnier ?
Most sweet lady , Oh , "sweet" !
I'll be back soon to wake up your generosity .
If he's got a message from the count , tell him I'm sick , or not home .
But you're a famous pirate !
The count's messenger , Cesario .
What can I give you that you want , my lord , except the one thing you can't have ?
He's a knight .
Give me your hand and let me see you dressed in woman's clothing .
Here she comes , the brilliant fool-catcher .
This is the man .
It's too late to go to bed now .
I rescued that ungrateful boy next to you from drowning .
I've heard my father mention him .
I hate an ungrateful man more than I hate lying , vanity , babbling , drunkenness , or any other vice that we feeble human beings are susceptible to. , Oh , my God !
Lady Strachy married her wardrobe manager .
All right , I'll stay another month .
The three-beat rhythm is a good for dancing , and the church bells chime , one , two , three .
I feel sorry for you .
Who treated you badly ?
Goodbye .
Come to my room later on .
Who's she ?
Sir !
I'm going to forget my duties to you a little bit and complain about the injuries you've caused me .
Good-bye .
You could just as easily say that a king sleeps near a beggar if the beggar lives near him , or that the church is supported by your drum because it "stands by" your drum .
I'm not a fighter .
You have my word as a gentleman that I'll always be grateful to you .
I know he's noble , rich , young , and with a fine reputation .
I didn't give her any ring .
Why do you say that ?
But I'll deliver Sir Andrew's challenge by word of mouth , describing Sir Andrew as courageous in battle and convincing the young gentleman that Sir Andrew is furious , impetuous , and a skilled fighter ( he'll believe me because he's young ) .
I promise .
I respect the soul very much , so I disagree with his belief .
You're absolutely right .
No trouble , sir .
I swear to you , I don't want to be doing this .
Where do you come from , sir ?
Go ahead and write it down .
I hope to God he keeps his promise !
He made my heart leap for you .
But you began so rudely .
To get used to the life you'll most likely be leading soon , get rid of your low-class trappings .
Or maybe there's a chance he didn't drown. , What do you think , sailors ?
Anyone who says that is a lying piece of garbage .
You can be a eunuch , but I'll be mute .
I'd send seven of my servants to go get him .
Accept it in body and spirit .
Some are born great , some achieve greatness , and some have greatness thrust upon them .
Oh , only time can sort out this mess .
The table of contents says it's in the first chapter of his heart .
I like singing .
Why , what's the matter with him ?
Fate , do your work .
Why are you talking like this ?
It's definitely Maria's handwriting .
I've sent for him .
What's your name ?
Oh , he's drunk , Sir Toby , for a whole hour now .
For God's sake , Sir Toby , you've got to come home earlier at night .

You still haven't said anything incriminating .
Please , do me this one favor : find out what I've done to offend this knight .
Ah , the countess is coming !
Why , anyone can see what this means .
Meanwhile , let's go to bed and dream about this .
I don't know , madam .
I'll write a letter challenging him to a duel on your behalf .
Do you want to go hunting , my lord ?
I don't have any "brilliant" reason for it , but I have a good enough reason .
Have you completely forgotten ?
That duke who lives nearby is courting her .
I can't figure it out by myself !
It's going to be fun , I promise .
You must have figured out who I am .
Oh , if it turns out to be true that he survived , then that storm was kind , and the ocean was full of love !
Where's the passage of holy scripture that you're basing your sermon on ?
He's as
And as for what I promised to you , I'm as good as my word .
Who's that at the gate , uncle ?
Hurt him in eleven different places .
Remember who liked your yellow stockings , " Your yellow stockings ?
You may leave .
You're so attractive when you smile .
Tell me why you did it .
I don't care what you think of me .
You should've saved me some trouble and taken it away yourself .
The fool's a good actor .
As sane as me ?
Take him away !
A gentleman .
And when she left just now , she said "Take care of this poor fellow here." Fellow ! " Not "Malvolio , " not anything referring to my low station in life , but "fellow." Everything's going perfectly .
I'm telling the truth .
A little bit .
But don't think I'm doing this because I'm greedy .
I'd be very grateful to you if you did .
Everyone , please leave us alone for a moment .
My lady Olivia , your niece , disapproves of your late-night partying .
What stunning , exquisite , and unmatchable beauty , but please , tell me if you're the lady of the house , because I've never seen her .
But you're still complaining of darkness and a bad view ?
Old age always makes people act funny , even wise people , but fools more than anybody .
Mr. Fabian , stay with this gentleman until I come back .
How do you know ?
And I wouldn't ask for any dowry except for her to play another trick like this one .
Don't refuse it .
Call in my maid .
The other day I saw him defeated in a
What money , sir ?
Father , could I please ask you to tell these people what happened between me and this young man ?
The gentleman insists on fighting a round with you , for the sake of his honor .
My servant !
I remember his face well .
Yes , that's the idea .
You shouldn't talk about him like that !
I wish I were something better , because right now I'm a big fool .
I've got her now , but I've got God to thank for it !
I swear on my life I won't tell your secret .
He's a coward , a total coward .
If you can't , and would prefer to leave , she's very willing to say goodbye to you .
I hope you go senile soon , sir , so you can become a more foolish fool !
Well , he'll be dead , so he won't see anything .
And the doctors say it's healthy to get up early , I don't know what the doctors say .
Yes , sir , we're part of her entourage .
Why do you keep these talents behind a curtain ?
But oops , when I let go of your hand , I let go of the biggest joke of all .
Do you have any doubts , Antonio ?
Hang on a minute , here's some money for you .
Orsino , sir , please don't call me those names .
Can you do that ?
I'm better off because of my enemies , and worse off because of my friends .
If he hadn't been drunk , he would've really roughed you up .
A woman should always pick an older man .
I know a lot about the love women can feel for men .
Come here , Sir Andrew .
Keep your money .
No man must know." What if this someone were you , Malvolio ?
Good night , you amazing woman , you .
It doesn't matter that I hit him first .
My prayers , you hussy ?
Hello , sir .
Some are born great , "
How are you feeling , Malvolio ?
Anything that's mended is only patched up .
Though the last time I saw him it was black from the smoke of war .
What kind of man is he ?
He's coming , madam ; but he's acting very strangely .
Here comes my lady .
Who's the ruler here ?
Please answer , my good little student .
He'll just think an idiot wrote it .
Please , hurry .
I'll get free of you .
He smiles so much his face has more lines in it than a map of the East Indies .
I'll do everything she wants me to do .
Here's a postscript ! .
Will you help me ? , What an ass and a fool , a gullible no-good idiot !
Call the priest .
But oh , what a deceiver he turned out to be !
Are you all crazy ?
I am a spirit , yes , since I have a soul .
I think you're denying what you really are .
You can't get any more money out of me right now .
Won't you be glad to see that rascal dog humiliated ?
I can't love him .
Tell me what a drunk is like , fool .
Ask him in here .
Get rid of your low-class trapping , " she said .
Blab my nonsense ?
Please , fool , go away .
We only drink toasts to my niece .
Do your job .
You must be mistaking me for someone else , sir .
To bed !
Are you still so cruel ?
Would you rather hear a love song or a song about the good life ?
She's a good little woman , and she adores me .
It's much better to be destroyed by a noble enemy than by a cruel and heartless one .
I'm sorry , Malvolio , but this isn't my writing , though I admit it looks like mine .
A beautiful voice , I swear .
He's written you a letter .
Come on , take us to him .
You probably killed a lot of his men ?
What do you want ?
Yes , it is , I think .
The man's going crazy .
Here comes the Duke now .
But if she can't love you , sir ?
Are you really going to pretend you don't know me now ?
Has it been so long ?
So could I .
Is this the kind of world where we hide our accomplishments ?
How can that be ?
The first drink makes him a fool , the second makes him crazy , and the third drowns him .
No , madam , I'm just reading an insane letter .
How old is he ?
I'll give it to him .
Can he deny it ?
For someone as intelligent as you the situation must be clear enough .
I'm not a paid messenger , my lady .
For the love of God , help us !
Signed , The poorly treated Malvolio." Did he write this ?
How are you , Malvolio ?
I could challenge him to a duel and then not show up .
I wish you all the best .
That's true .
Dearest Olivia , What do you have to say for yourself , Cesario ? , My lord , please , My lord wants to speak .
I'll be vain and proud , I'll read up on politics , I'll insult Sir Toby , I'll get rid of my lower-class friends , and I'll be the perfect man for her .
What ?
Oh please , go somewhere else to blab your nonsense .
Damn that Toby !
Should we do that ?
So find someone younger to love , or you won't be able to maintain your feelings .
Beautiful ladies , please don't treat me badly .
But I'm still fairly high-ranking .
No , sir , I won't let you go .
So goodbye , my lady .
I was so crazy myself that I forgot all about him .
So shut up !
Did it really work ?
He died on Viola's thirteenth birthday .
Go on .
Who tricked you ?
Oh , I know .
Be quick .
It hangs like an old worn-out mop .
Let him be the devil if he wants to , I don't care .
I'd write sad songs about unrequited love and sing them loudly in the middle of the night .
I recognize your face perfectly , even without a sailor's cap on your head. , Take him away .
I know you're the right person for this job .
It's really the only way , Sir Andrew .
Fool , I'll repay you for this favor .
How are you , my golden girl ?
As the sonnet says , "If you please one special person , you please everyone who matters." Why , what's going on ?
But I'll admit I don't care for you .
Should I blab to her that you're coming ?
That's not holy , it's heresy .
Please don't say no .
He's somewhere between boy and man .
No , good Sir Toby .
Oh , I'm talking too loud. , Where's Malvolio ?
with the same accessories .
There's no darkness except ignorance , and you're more ignorant than the Egyptians during the plague of fog .
I swear I am .
Wise men who give fools money might get a good reputation , if they keep up regular payments for fourteen years .
Lady Olivia told her servant Malvolio to kick you out of the house .
Come here !
Sure thing , we'll do it tomorrow morning .
A false conclusion .
No , leave him alone .
It's about you .
I'll go to him .
Sir , the person who should sing that song isn't here .
What gentleman ?
Here comes my little bird .
Please , my lady , just confirm that you're the lady of the house so I can get on with my speech .
For some reason he's in prison now on some legal technicality , on Malvolio's orders .
Noble people don't answer to peasants !
How old is she ?
And what am I supposed to do in Illyria ?
Don't worry about me .
These crisscrossing laces do cut off the circulation in my legs a bit , but who cares ?
He really is the most skillful , bloodthirsty , and dangerous opponent you can find in Illyria .
The brilliant Sir Topas !
He's a fool and a spendthrift .
This is as rude as it is strange .
How could I honorably give him what I've already given you ?
No , not at all .
Now go !
Hello , sir !
Tell him he's not going to speak with me .
But that's not part of what I'm supposed to say .
Come on , let's put him in a dark room and tie him up .
I'm as crazy as he is , if sad craziness and happy craziness are equivalent .
Lady Olivia will have you executed for not showing up .
Yes , sir .
Where's Antonio , then ?
I'd give forty pounds to be safe at home right now .
Dear God , thank you !
Is this the madman ?
Oh , Sir Toby , stop !
It's true , he died on the day my sister turned thirteen .
But did your sister die of love ?
You're right .
When I first heard about him , he was still a bachelor .
Let's go !
Tell him not to send any more messengers , unless you feel like coming back to tell me how he took the bad news .
Oh , please be true , please let it be that this man has mistaken me for you , my dear brother !
We'll meet at the Elephant .
That governs the torso and heart , doesn't it ?
Madam , Count Orsino's young messenger has returned .
My lady would never want to lose him .
Take away this fool , gentlemen .
Stop right now or I'll throw your dagger over the roof .
But maybe by some fluke he was saved too .
My dear lady , Please let me say something , I'm begging you .
This letter's going to turn him into a starry-eyed idiot .
I don't know what you've done to upset him , but someone has challenged you to a duel .
Come on , sir , please .
What does You'd have a great hairstyle if you had .
Anything I did to you , I did it because Sir Toby made me .
And he doesn't let go of his target when a distraction appears .
Close the garden door and leave me alone to hear his message .
May I kiss your feet ?
Let's dance to "You Jerk." You mean , "Shut up , you jerk" ?
But I just can't love him .
Priest .
We've got some words of wisdom to mull over .
It doesn't matter how I am : he hurt me , and that's that .
My niece Olivia will notice , and let me tell you , no matchmaker in the world can get you a woman faster than a reputation for courage .
I don't think so , my lord .
How are you , sir ?
If this young gentleman has offended you , I'll take the blame for it .
So we should eat and drink .
If you tell your lady I'm here to speak with her , and bring her out with you when you come back , you might make me more generous .
He knows I recognize him .
Well , because I saw your niece Olivia treat the count's messenger better than she's ever treated me .
Tell me what it's about .
Darn it , if I'd guessed he was so brave and such a good swordsman , I never would have challenged him .
Oh , say it , and mean it !
My father had a daughter who loved a man in the same way that I might love you , if I were a woman .
Antonio , oh my dear Antonio !
A devil like you could lead me to hell .
He says he'll come .
If this were a play , I'd complain it was unrealistic .
Go after him and try to calm him down a little .
I'll drink to her as long as there's a hole in my throat and booze in Illyria .
It's only for your willing and receptive ear .
Would it be better if I were that , instead of what I am ?
At your service , madam .
You're serious enough to know not to play games with Satan .
Please let me prove you're a fool .
And by all means see if you can get the young man to answer it .
But here she comes .
You're overstepping your bounds now .
She's sending this ring back to you , sir .
Yet I wish I could .
I know you .
Oh , please , I'm begging you , don't mention him again .
That's true .
Go and wiggle your ears !
You'd better think up a way to defend yourself .
Take me .
He still hasn't told us about the captain .
She flirted with the messenger boy to exasperate you , fire up your passions , and make you angry and jealous .
No man must know." What comes after that ?
What about it ?
My niece already thinks he's insane .
I had a round with him , and his sword thrust is so deadly that you can't even duck out of the way .
Look how shapely your legs are .
Madam ?
I'll try to calm him down for you if I can .
Come with me , please .
He insisted on leaving this ring with me whether I wanted it or not .
Honestly , I can't .
Keep a little bit of honesty , even if you're afraid .
Virtue is beauty , but someone beautiful and wicked is like an empty box decorated by the devil .
Absolutely .
That's a lame answer .
Yes , it stinks very sweetly .
Master Malvolio ?
I will , my lady , but a sane person reading this would make it sound crazy .
You're wrong , sir , I do care about something .
The rules of dueling say he has to .
Madam , please let me see your face .
I know I can do it .
Ever since the Duke's messenger visited Olivia , she's been upset .
If we don't , it'll be the biggest disappointment of our lives .
That's out of tune , sir .
Challenge the count's young servant to a fight .
I saw you at Count Orsino's recently .
I've heard of men who pick fights with other people on purpose , just to see how brave they are .
What can possibly fix this situation ?
Watch his reaction .
Sir Toby needs help right away .
That's the weakness I'll use to get revenge on him .
The world's gone downhill since fake humility started passing for compliments .
He claimed to know that already too , and said that's the reason he's come to speak with you .
No , I'm telling you , put on this robe and beard .
Why , would that have fixed my hair ?
Sir Topas , Sir Topas , good Sir Topas , please go find my lady Olivia , Get out , demon !
Yes , and he'll keep getting funnier till he dies .
I'll go on with my speech praising you , and then I'll get to the point .
He's wearing yellow stockings .
You can't go back into the house unless you want to fight with me , and if you're willing to do that , you might as well just go and fight with him .
Cesario , come here .
That's too bad , because I spent a long time memorizing it , and it's poetic .
He's got an answer for everything .
Orsino .
You could've done this without your beard and gown .
Did she see you there the whole time , old boy ?
I'd say I was "out of my element , " but that phrase is overused , so I'll say I'm "out of my air."
Here comes the messenger with your niece .
Ask me any commonsense question .
Don't say that , unless you want to be one of my friends .
He's very serious , which is right for someone in mourning like me .
I know my medicine will work on him .
I could marry that Maria for thinking this up .
Meanwhile , I'll think of some horrible way to phrase the challenge .
Come on , get ready .
With crisscrossed laces ?
Nothing , except your true love for my lord .
I'll never believe a madman until I can see his brains .
From that cabin I'd call out to my soul .
An hour before you pulled me out of the breaking waves , my sister drowned .
No , I'll prove it with airtight evidence and logical argument .
Anyway , sir , should I go see the lady ?
Don't be afraid of greatness." That was well written .
But you're not going to deliver it , are you ?
Go ahead .
From soldiers .
Yes , if you kept them together and invested them .
Sing us a song .
The fact that he serves as a go-between for his lord and my niece Olivia confirms this .
He's a fool , a madman , and a drowned man .
I like you very much .
Maria , take care of this poor fellow here .
You're right .
If this logic works , that's great .
Just a man , like any other .
Let's go to bed , knight .
Madam , you've treated me badly , very badly .
I tell you , this house is as dark as ignorance .
His letter's going to be hilarious .
No , sir , I live by the church .
Give it to me .
Go hang yourselves , all of you !
I won't mess with him .
He's been over there practicing how to act for the past half hour .
I don't want to have anything to do with you anymore .
It starts , "Shut up." I'll never be able to start if I shut up .
He was a wreck , almost past hope .
If this letter falls into your hands , think carefully about what it says .
Who are you ?
But he'd been there before me , and they told me he'd gone out looking for me .
People say he's generous , well educated , and brave , and he's very attractive .
There must be some mistake , sir .
What are you saying , mistress ?
I'd rather be a heretic than a schemer with fancy plots .
But I'm still fairly high-ranking .
Excuse me , sir , do you know anything about this ?
I hate your logic as much as I hate an empty drinking cup .
We'll have another bear-baiting just to make him angry , and we'll mock him till he's black and blue .
Hello , sir .
What an idiotic place this world is .
Not old enough to be a man , but not young enough to be a boy .
My friend Antonio , all I can say is thank you .
I hate no-good drunks .
As for his cowardliness , ask Fabian .
If you want to watch , follow me .
Well then , improve your situation with a show of courage .
Thank God and my horoscope !
I know I will too , if it's the last thing I do .
Why , he has an income of three thousand ducats a year .
Go , Sir Andrew .
It's easier to buy young people than to beg or borrow them .
If they aren't , they can go hang themselves by their own laces !
What's she trying to say ?
Go away .
But still , she's going to kill you for being gone so long .
I'm sure nobody would have any reason to fight with me .
Goodbye , you beautiful , cruel woman .
You're right , sir .
It's too bad their beauty fades right when it reaches perfection !
You threw it at her rudely , and she wants you to take it back .
You've shut me up in a dark room and given your drunken cousin authority over me , but I'm as sane as you are .
He looks like he just recently stopped breastfeeding .
What's wrong with my niece ?
If you can shape up , you're welcome to stay in the house .
I wish you were what I wanted you to be !
What are you thinking ?
I wouldn't have missed this even for a pension of thousands of pounds , to be paid by the shah of Persia .
If you insist on trying my patience any further , then take out your sword right now .
You do Stay , Please , tell me what you think of me .
Madam , there's a young gentleman at the gate who really wants to speak to you .
Take me to the garden .
About as old as you are , my lord .
He's very handsome and speaks well , but he's very young .
As for Monsieur Malvolio , let me take care of him .
But I know you'd never force me to tell you things I don't want to , so I should be polite and tell you what I can .
He's killed three people , and he's so furious right now that the only thing that will satisfy him is seeing you die .
I'll be thrilled .
As for him , I never think about him .
I think we know whose fancy handwriting that was .
Madam !
Take this .
Make him think you're Sir Topas the priest .
No woman's heart is big enough to hold all my love .
No , follow him now , before he divulges the prank and ruins everything .
I told them to take Oh , what a big mistake !
Aren't you Lady Olivia's fool ?
This will make them both so afraid that they'll kill each other just by looking at each other .
Why are you bothering this poor man !
And I too ?
Well , go along now .
Hello to you .
It won't annoy you like me , because it doesn't have a voice .
No , please , read it like a sane person .
But don't be afraid , Cesario .
Be pointed and brief .
I'm headed for your niece , sir .
He was the captain of a flimsy boat that was practically worthless because it was so small .
Signed , she who would be your servant , The Fortunate Unhappy." This is as clear as sunlight in an open field .
He's going to look like a total idiot .
No , I'd rather you stayed here .
What are you going to do now ?
Oh , no question , it won't style itself .
If you're the lady of the house , then it's true you're stealing your role , because what's yours to give away is not yours to keep for yourself .
Well , well .
There's a lot to learn when a fool recites the words of a madman .
Have some of my servants take care of Malvolio .
You're asking me !
Ah , how will this all turn out ?
I'll do my best to make this lady love you .
What do you think of his belief ?
He's a very dishonest , puny boy , and more cowardly than a rabbit .
But you have to .
Are they likely to get dusty ?
Don't you have any respect for anything ?
Goodbye .
He left behind myself and my twin sister , who was born in the same hour as me .
Sir Toby Belch !
Didn't you hear her , guys ?
That's a step in the direction of love .
I accept that offer happily , madam .
My dear madam , why are you in mourning ?
I am , unless I somehow stole this role .
I'm very sensitive , and even the smallest bit of rudeness hurts my feelings .
The same people who say he gets drunk with you every night .
This is just what the letter said .
Madam , I've come here to try to make you like him .
Anything .
Do you want to go see him ?
Dark as hell , Sir Topas .
Fool , fool , hey , fool !
Hello to you too , sir .
Maria , our lady wants you .
Are you trying to make fun of me ?
You're better off because of your friends .
I'll have to ask you some questions , madam .
Good for you , holding out on me like this !
I'm the man she wants .
She did compliment me on my yellow stockings recently , and she said she liked how the crisscross laces looked on my legs .
I like it too .
You call this house dark ?
Why , man ?
Well , you know , "some are born great , some achieve greatness , and some have greatness thrust upon them." Anyway , I was part of the trick , sir .
Where's Cesario going ?
If this letter doesn't make him fight , I don't know what will .
Yes , yes .
Here's more insanity for us .
I know I'm not fooling myself , or letting myself get carried away by my imagination , because every clue points to the fact that Lady Olivia loves me .
He's pale and hyperventilating , as if a bear were chasing him .
So this letter , which is so incredibly stupid and ignorant , isn't going to scare him at all .
If only you were , sir .
I will do so .
Well , we all have our special gifts .
I'm sorry , but I memorized what I'm supposed to say here today , and that question isn't part of the speech I learned .
I saw it in the orchard .
Now please stop being so strange and tell me what exactly I should blab to my lady .
I breathed from my soul the most faithful offerings to your ungrateful altars that any devoted person has ever offered , what more am I supposed to do ?
So let me hear what you have to say .
Maybe you'll see some little trinket you want to buy .
I'll write out a detailed inventory of my beauty and label every part .
What's going on ?
Here , take the ring .
You're awfully eager to fight .
If this is a dream , let me keep on sleeping !
Let's go for it .
Damn that dirty black coalminer of a devil !
It's pretty well done , isn't it ?
Good .
This may end without anyone getting killed .
You won't be wasting your time , because I really can sing and talk to him about many different kinds of music , so he'll be happy to have me in his service .
Wait , here's a coin for you .
Why are you talking like that ?
If only I could somehow relate them to me !
Nonsense .
It looks great .
I wish you all the best .
But as a gentleman and a soldier he's promised me he won't hurt you .
Well , she can get used to it .
Taurus !
I'll give it a try .
What a wonderful time to be alive !
My dear fool , because my brother died .
She's not good enough for you , then .
But who cares .
I want to be this Duke's servant .
Please smile whenever you're near me , my dearest darling."
I'll do it .
Play me some music .
But I swear I'm not the person I'm playing .
Sir Toby would bet a fortune that I'm not smart , but he wouldn't bet two cents that you're not a fool .
There's some gentleman out there. , Good Sir Toby !
Meanwhile , I'll get Sir Toby .
I have to obey .
Do that .
What have you heard from her ?
There's no ambiguity here .
What country is this , friends ?
I did , Malvolio ?
Doesn't that sound like true love ?
Your hand is Well , I hope so .
Goodbye .
You , sir ?
Put your sword away .
Get out of my sight ! , Dear Cesario , please don't be offended. , Get out of here , you barbarian !
Come on .
Does she ?
Yes , husband .
Who did this to him ?
After you cast your magic spell on me last time , I sent you a ring .
I didn't find him at the Elephant .
If not , what can you do about it ?

Then repeat this after me : you can't expect women to be faithful when men are so unreliable .
How sound asleep she is !
Yes , you've been a ladies ' man in your time .
The ground is bloody .
Madam , an eagle does not have eyes as green , as quick , and as fair as the eyes of Paris .
Didn't he come home last night ?
I hit hard when I'm angry .
Did you have no poison , no sharp knife , no weapon you could use to kill me quickly , nothing so disgraceful , except banishment ?
Even if the news is sad , tell me with a smile on your face .
I wish you had my bones , and I had your news .
Is it now afternoon ?
Haven't you ever heard the saying , "Two can conspire to put one away" ?
Yes , alright , go , I say , and bring him here .
Give me the vial .
I wish night would come , like a widow dressed in black , so I can learn how to submit to my husband and lose my virginity .
Your mother is coming to your bedroom .
My daughter married death .
She and Susan , God rest her and all Christian souls , were born on the same day .
Sadness takes away our color .
I'm going to the Friar to find out his solution .
Hey , mistress !
Just cry out , "Ah me ! " Just say "love" and "dove." Say just one lovely word to my good friend
I made my father angry , so I went to Friar Lawrence's cell to confess and be forgiven .
Let me see her .
It is "music with her silver sound , " because musicians have no gold to use to make sounds .
The world is not your friend , and neither is the law .
Stay , then .
Are you gone like that , my love , my lord ?
Tybalt was my nephew !
And yet you say that exile is not death ?
Oh my !
Believe me , I'll draw my sword as quick as any other man if I see a fight starting and the law is on my side .
Now , before God , our whole city owes this friar a great debt .
Can't you understand what I'm saying ?
The citizens are around , and Tybalt is dead .
Do you think it's a good idea to rush ?
Oh , by this count I'll be many years older before I see my Romeo again .
Why are you knocking so hard ?
Virginity makes her look sick and green .
It makes me mad .
Hey , hurry up , hurry up !
Take my advice .
Oh painful , painful , painful day !
Come over here , nurse .
Get up , man !
And so , good Capulet , which is a name I love like my own name , you should be satisfied with what I say .
Wake up the Montagues .
Even if it's not better , your first marriage is over .
Feeling the loss like this , I can't help but weep for him forever .
Are you a man ?
Wait good Nurse .
I didn't tell you to get rid of one love and replace her with another .
Dinner is over , and we're going to get there too late .
You blush bright red as soon as you hear any news .
Oh , " he said , "Did you fall on your face ?
Can't you find a reason without my giving you one ?
Do you have permission to go out and take confession today ?
God bless you .
I won't listen to your pleas or excuses .
Oh pain !
I'll frown at them as they pass by , and they can react however they want .
It's torture , not mercy .
I'll pretend to be the housewife for once .
Everyone says you can't make up your mind .
By nine o'clock .
I love rich Capulet's daughter .
The other girl did not love me .
Oh , pardon me for bringing this bad news , but you told me it was my job , sir .
You started a fight with a man who coughed in the street because he woke up a dog that was sleeping in the sun .
Don't stand there shocked .
What does my hidden wife say about our ruined love ?
Tell her to come to me .
The second cock crowed .
If you leave me like this , you're doing me wrong .
Is the Prince's punishment any less awful than doomsday ?
I carry no hatred , holy man , because my request will benefit my enemy .
She's been dead for some time .
The fight is between our masters , and we men who work for them .
You haven't been conquered .
I'll tell you more later about when and where we met , how we fell in love , and how we exchanged promises , but now I'm begging you : please , agree to marry us today .
Oh , my !
Your husband lies dead there , and Paris too .
Today's a holiday , so the beggar's shop is shut .
Or else love is blind , and its best time is the night .
Romeo has been banished." That news brings infinite death .
Why , then , should I cry ?
Although you bring me joy , I can't take joy in this exchange of promises tonight .
Well , you have made a foolish choice .
Beat the drum .
My eyes were liars , then , because I never saw true beauty before tonight .
They are crying and moaning over Tybalt's corpse .
Goodbye , cousin .
From now until then seems like twenty years .
Have courage , man .
What should I swear by ?
All this is comforting news .
Give me a torch .
Love will give me strength , and strength will help me accomplish this plan .
Why should you fall into so deep a moan ?
Get up .
Is it that early in the day ?
Oh my , my bones ache so much .
I won't fail .
And , when I do marry , I swear , it will be Romeo , whom you know I hate , rather than Paris .
Tybalt , that murderer , which way did he run ?
But here come some people , right in the nick of time .
Alright , I will .
Let the blood rushing to my cheeks be calmed .
I bet she's fast asleep .
Uncle , this man is a Montague , our enemy .
Romeo ?
Oh great , here come the Capulets .
The things I'm saying are fair and honest .
And everything will be alright , I promise you , wife .
Can't I say something ?
But it's enough .
Nurse , give my regards to to your lady .
What have you found out ?
Who is that gentleman ?
What is this ?
Night is over , and day is coming .
He is the son and heir of old Tiberio .
You would take it back ?
You know too much about suffering .
I brought my master news of Juliet's death .
Signor Martino and his wife and daughters , Count Anselme and his beautiful sisters , Vitruvio's widow , Signor Placentio and his lovely nieces , Mercutio and his brother Valentine , My uncle Capulet and his wife and daughters , My fair niece Rosaline and Livia ,
This is the most miserable hour of all time !
Please grant my prayer so my faith doesn't turn to despair .
Think about the ones who have died .
If he hears you , you'll make him angry .
So calm down .
It's been eleven years since the earthquake .
Who's that calling ?
I hope you enjoy the same sweet peace and rest I feel in my heart .
Look at other beautiful girls .
Oh , so madmen like you are also deaf .
As I remember , this should be the house .
Oh painful day , Oh painful day !
I bet it's a challenge .
He's not your man .
Tell me , Friar , in what part of my body is my name embedded ?
She disgusts me , the little hussy !
I will die and leave Death everything .
The curfew-bell rang .
Look , my love , what are those streaks of light in the clouds parting in the east ?
What's all the noise in here ?
Oh , what better favor can I do for you than to kill the man who killed you with the same hand that made you die young .
But like I said , when she tasted the bitter wormwood on my nipple , the pretty little babe got irritated and started to quarrel with my breast .
That's how flimsy and unreal pleasure is .
Not me , believe me .
The Right .
You gave us the slip , sir , the slip .
You're this poor and wretched and still afraid to die ?
Go , tell the Prince .
Won't he ?
In the meantime , hold on , and be patient .
Yes , pilgrim , they have lips that they're supposed to pray with .
What ?
Now he'll sit under a Let's go .
How is she ?
He carries himself like a dignified gentleman , and , to tell you the truth , he has a reputation throughout Verona as a virtuous and well-behaved young man .
I hear a noise inside .
His love is blind , so it belongs in the dark .
Lady , come out of the tomb .
No words can express the pain .
Sing my praises to your mistress .
Romeo .
I'll go to him .
Your cheeks are thin because of hunger .
Well , I'm glad about this .
Can your man keep a secret ?
Only you would look for a fight like that .
I'm whipped and tortured , May God give you a good evening .
Look how she leans her hand on her cheek .
Oh , where's Romeo ?
You go to Friar Lawrence's cell .
But love gives them power , and time gives them the chance to meet , sweetening the extreme danger with intense pleasure .
Not to his father's house .
I wish I were Sleep and Peace , so I could spend the night with you .
Give my compliments to your lady .
You wouldn't tell a sick man he "seriously" has to make his will , it would just make him worse .
Put your hand on your heart and listen to my advice .
But like I said , on the night of Lammas Eve , she will be fourteen .
I had put bitter wormwood on my breast as I was sitting in the sun , under the wall of the dovehouse .
Tybalt was my dearest cousin .
That braggart , punk villain who fights like he learned swordsmanship from a manual !
I am tired .
Has Romeo been killed , and is Tybalt dead too ?
Have you told her our decision ?
But as soon as the sun rises in the east , my sad son comes home to escape the light .
If she was young and passionate , she'd move as fast as a ball .
I wouldn't insult him in my own house for all the wealth in this town .
From the Earth's womb , many different sorts of plants and animals come forth , and the Earth provides her children with many excellent forms of nourishment .
The bridegroom is already here .
I'm arresting you as a criminal .
Please , tell my father , madam , I won't marry yet .
Is he man enough at this point to face off with Tybalt ?
Oh , she's slow !
I wish the fool were dead and married to her grave !
Send your man away .
She's talking , but she's not saying anything .
Everything's out of control .
Leave me alone .
No , good goose , don't bite me .
Oh , she knew very well that you were acting like you were in love without really knowing what love means .
The beautiful Rosaline whom you love so much will be at Capulet's traditional feast , along with every beautiful woman in Verona .
Or was I dreaming ?
What ?
You will also confess , I'm sure , that you love me .
It is best to marry well and die young , better than to be married for a long time .
Why , may I ask ?
Well go on home .
He deserves only honor , complete honor .
Here , sir , this is a ring she asked me to give you .
Here comes the lady .
We have a little dessert coming up .
Shame on you !
Forget about him , Jack !
What does he say about our marriage ?
It's not daylight .
Love's messengers should be thoughts , which fly ten times faster than sunbeams .
I want to stay more than I want to go .
I'll call you a minstrel .
Our celebratory hymns will change to sad funeral marches .
Go and get her dressed .
But I would kill you by petting you too much .
For when you cut your shin .
Can I go away while my heart stays here ?
Your life insurance ?
Let me be captured .
No matter .
Oh , for God's sake .
There were twenty Montagues fighting in this awful riot , and together those twenty could only kill one man .
Please tell me .
Cut off their heads ?
I've stayed up all night many times before for less important matters , and I've never gotten sick .
Or , if you don't delay , make my wedding bed in the tomb where Tybalt lies .
It's almost morning .
Goodness , it's daylight .
Right , and well said .

Pharmacist !
Father , what's the news ?
I drink to you .
The women you rape are the ones who'll have to "sense" it .
I'm happy to meet you , my lady and my wife .
Tell me , how did you get in here ?
Madam , your mother wants to talk to you .
Oh , rude and unthankful boy !
Tsk , you're wrong .
I hope maybe then you'll send him back home soon .
Oh no !
Well , start thinking about marriage now .
Make it a word and a blow .
Another studpid answer !
You poor soul , your face has suffered many tears .
Start a fight ?
You have more wild goose in one of your jokes than I have in five of mine .
I swear by my holy order , I thought you were smarter and more rational than this .
Oh painful sympathy !
Go .
You have so much natural talent , but like someone who hoards money , you use none of your talent for the right purpose , not your body , not your love , not your mind .
Then I'll be quick .
Good man , why are you crying ?
Shame on Romeo !
What further pain must I endure in my old age ?
But he's not better than mine .
It was a painful bruise , and she was crying bitterly .
My master is the great and rich Capulet , and if you don't belong to the house of Montague , please come and drink a cup of wine .
Give me that pickax and the crowbar .
Goodbye , dear Father .
He knows what ?
And death , not Romeo , can take my virginity !
She's not talking to me .
Calling death banishment is like cutting off my head with a golden ax and smiling while I'm being murdered .
Oh , blessed , blessed night !
Indeed , I should have asked you before who he was .
Arms , make your last embrace !
Calm down , gentle cousin .
What will you give us ?
If I do so , it will mean more if I say it behind your back than if I say it to your face .
Be quiet , you mumbling fool !
Is love really tender ?
Monday , my lord .
Why do you complain about your birth , the heavens , and the earth ?
I wish I had not lived long enough to see him die .
Go be with your love , as it was decided at your wedding .
That's very soon .
If I were in the habit of fighting the way you are , my life insurance rates would be sky high .
Come on !
I know what I'll do .
Yes , that's true .
You mean their Cut off their heads , take their maidenheads , whatever .
Then the dovehouse shook with the earthquake .
Mercutio , you hang out with Romeo .
How is she doing ?
Hey , Nurse !
Will I be married tomorrow morning ?
You speak well .
Here , here I'll remain with worms that are your chamber-maids .
If I had seen something like that , I would have quickly pulled out my weapon .
No .
Well , may peace be with you .
What is this ?
Saint Francis , help me !
I hear that you must marry this count on Thursday , and that nothing can delay it .
Don't you have a letter for me from the friar ?
Hold him in custody until the Prince gets here .
Out .
Thursday it is , then .
That sound you heard was the It was the lark , the bird that sings at dawn , not the nightingale .
Oh , in this love , you love your child so badly , that you go mad , even though she is in heaven .
Her bridegroom is here .
May a plague strike both your families !
Who's calling me ?
I can read my own fortune in my misery .
Go to your bedroom .
Doesn't she realize how unworthy she is of the gentleman we have found to be her bridegroom ?
Yes , madam .
But when I say so , I swear she turns white as a sheet .
So stay for a while .
Either my eyesight is failing me , or you look pale .
Sir Paris , I'll make a desperate argument for my child's love .
What do you want ?
I didn't see anybody use you for kicks .
Wife !
Find the people whose names are on this list ?
Madam , tell me quickly , what day is that ?
I thought it was the right thing to do .
I nursed her daughter , whom you were just talking to .
Well then , saint , let lips do what hands do .
This is as bad as the tortures of hell .
Don't worry about the cost .
My husband is alive on earth , my vows of marriage are in heaven .
But why , you villain , did you kill my cousin ?
Were you here when it started ?
Nurse !
Your answer is so strange !
Come , is the bride ready to go to church ?
I assure you , my man is as true as steel .
You're a lover .
No .
Go wisely and slowly .
Then don't move while I act out my prayer .
Girls who marry so young grow up too soon .
Am I really like one of those guys ?
Give me one kiss , and I'll go down .
Down with the Montagues !
I had come to the deepest part of my tale , and I planned to say nothing more on the topic .
Be quiet , for shame !
We'll follow you .
I'll give him equal thanks , so we're even .
I would be glad to forget about it , but it weighs on my memory like sins linger in guilty minds .
Oh , sad day !
Now please listen , sir .
Things have turned out so unluckily , sir , that we haven't had time to convince our daughter to marry you .
There is no world for me outside the walls of Verona , except purgatory , torture , and hell itself .
Goddammit !
And yet you're the one who wants to teach me about restraint !
I'll make this wedding happen tomorrow morning .
Oh , deadly sin !
I bet he slipped away and went home to bed .
Think about it .
Probably because my cousin the villain would have killed my husband .
O Lord , I could stay here all night listening to such good advice .
I know you'll say "yes , " and I'll believe you .
You could not prevent her from dying someday , but heaven will give her eternal life .
Well , girl , you're weeping not for his death as much as for the fact that the villain who killed him is still alive .
Get away from here and leave me .
Our love , which right now is like a flower bud in the summer air , may turn out to be a beautiful flower by the next time we meet .
Look , she's come home from confession with a happy look on her face .
It's Mercutio's relative , noble Count Paris !
I think I see my cousin Tybalt's ghost .
Did he get away clean ?
Will you pull your sword out of its sheath ?
Is it good or bad ?
Your servants were fighting your enemy's servants before I got here .
Get me some ink and paper , and hire some horses to ride .
You're wearing dancing shoes with nimble soles .
Stay here for a moment .
Put the torch out , so I can't be seen .
No , noble Romeo , you've got to dance .
Virtue turns to vice if it's misused .
I've found it out .
He's not telling the truth .
Your mother .
Parting is such sweet sorrow that I'll say good night until tonight becomes tomorrow .
Are they washing out his wounds with their tears ?
Was I even close to you in the chase for the goose ?
Good morning to you both .
Go , girl , look for a man who'll give you happy nights at the end of happy days .
Come , death , and welcome !
Yes , she will .
Will you cry about your cousin's death forever ?
Take these keys and get more spices , Nurse .
Tybalt is dead , and Romeo has been banished .
Oh no !
I'll bring you there .
Madam !
Let them start something .
So get out of here !
I swear , it must be thirty years .
Otherwise , you'd see me blushing about the things you've heard me say tonight .
It's already almost night .
Now that you are down there , you look like someone dead in the bottom of a tomb .
Oh , I wish I could make a My soul is calling out my name .
What crimes happen so early in the morning that I have to wake up before the usual time ?
I'll cry my tears for Romeo's banishment when their tears are dry .
Oh , what a sad day !
Hold on , then .
Wish me luck .
Oh , noise ?
Herbs , plants , and stones possess great power .
Gregory , remember how to slash .
Don't swear at all .
Is it my mother ?
You're not taking one step toward an enemy .
Just say "Yes" and I will turn more poisonous than the snake with the evil eye .
Hang out ? " Who do you think we are , musicians in a band ?
Why are you acting so angry ?
I'd bet fourteen of my own teeth , but , I'm sorry to say , I only have four teeth , she's not fourteen .
A jealous woman , a jealous woman !
Welcome back from Mantua .
You should go to Juliet and dress her up .
What an annoying man , this guy is !
Whose house ?
And tell her , listen to me , on Wednesday , Wait , What day is today ?
There is no life , but my love is dead !
Well then , I'll say this quickly : the valiant Paris wants you as his bride .
Either put away your sword or use it to help me stop this fight .
What do you want ?
It's still a long time until daybreak .
No , I haven't had lunch .
I'm not myself .
You have amazed me .
A woman more beautiful than the one I love ?
I know where he is .
Get on your way and hire those horses .
Take away this body , and do what I say .
Eyes , look out for the last time !
Alright , let's fight , boy !
I remember very well where I should be , and here I am .
Break it up." Then he jumped in between them and forced them to put their swords down .
My back aches too ,
I'm ready .
His crime did justice's job by taking Tybalt's life .
The sun itself has never seen anyone as beautiful since the world began .
Accursed , unhappy , wretched , hateful day !
The Earth is nature's mother and also nature's tomb .
You don't have to go yet .
More and more light .
Now my sin has been taken from my lips by yours .
For a full half hour .
Come break this up , Benvolio .
I'll teach you a lesson .
No , my good lord .
We're unprepared for this wedding celebration .
I'd rather they killed me than have to live without your love .
She's cold .
Ask for me tomorrow , and you'll find me in a grave .
What villain , madam ?
In my desperate situation , I have to act alone .
The man who killed Mercutio , which way did he go ?
No money , I swear .
What is this fuzzy logic ?
Now get out of here .
Let them put fear in your heart .
There , where the torch is burning .
Very suspicious .
Leave me and do what I told you to do .
I'll go call the watch .
Go to the church .
Tell me seriously , who is the one you love ?
He's thirty years old .
Everything depends on this : either be out of here before the night watchmen take their positions , or leave in disguise after daybreak .
Tell him so yourself , and see how he takes the news .
Live , and from now on , say a madman mercifully told you to run away .
Now , I swear , I'm so angry that I'm shaking all over .
No !
Let's get out of here .
You worthless girl !
Have I waited so long to see this morning , only to see this ?
It's a cup , closed in my true love's hand ?
Signor Valentio and his cousin Tybalt , Lucio and the lively Helena." That's a nice group of people .
Madam , I'm here .
I sent the Nurse at nine o'clock .
Your love says , like an honorable gentleman , who is courteous , kind , handsome , and , I believe , virtuous , where is your mother ?
And why , wise lady ?
Stand up if you're really a man .
Have you had lunch yet ?
Darkness is stumbling out of the sun's path like a drunk man .
You look pale and wild as if you're going to hurt yourself .
Let me talk to you about your situation .
Stand up .
Come , Romeo .
Our wedding banquet will become a sad burial feast .
Oh , holy Friar , Oh , tell me , holy Friar , where is my lady's husband ?
Oh nature , what were you doing in hell ?
You , good friend , save me a piece of marzipan , and if you love me , have the porter let in Susan Grindstone and Nell .
What do you have to say , my dear Nurse ?
Don't saints and pilgrims have lips too ?
I'm in a rush .
Give me the letter .
Go , get out of here .
Is the worst well ?
That's good , my boy .
I stretch my joke for that word "fat." If you add that word to the word "goose , " it shows that you are a fat goose .
That's him , that villain Romeo .
What are you going to tell her , Nurse ?
Yes , those are the best clothes .
Oh , I wish I was the glove on that hand so that I could touch that cheek .
My soul is made out of lead , and it's so heavy it keeps me stuck on the ground so I can't move .
Oh , look !
He's been seen there many mornings , crying tears that add drops to the morning dew and making a cloudy day cloudier with his sighs .
Do you bring me a letter from the friar ?
That "may be" must be , love , on Thursday .
Don't you see that I'm out of breath ?
You lie .
But come on , inconsistent young man , come with me .
I am the greatest , but I was able to do the least .
It would have been better if , after she said , "Tybalt's dead , " she told me my mother or my father , or both , were gone .
Tomorrow night make sure that you are alone .
You say you don't know what the girl thinks .
He lets the bird hop a little from his hand and then yanks him back by a string .
Oh , you're just going to talk about banishment again .
Romeo , come out .
Come on , we're wasting precious daylight .
Indeed , I remember it well .
Here's something good .
Lose nothing ?
Gentlemen , can any of you tell me where I can find young Romeo ?
But like a misbehaved , sullen girl , you're whining about your bad luck and your love .
You , Prince , are the man who can give me justice .
Here in Verona there are girls younger than you , girls from noble families , who have already become mothers .
Are you trying to start a fight ?
I'll answer for you .
You're getting too angry .
Give my regards to your daughter .
You had this child with the help of heaven .
What's this ?
The excuse you make to delay the news is longer than the news itself .
Has Romeo killed himself ?
It's some meteor coming out of the sun to light your way to Mantua .
Sometimes she tickles a priest's nose with a Enough , enough !
At Friar Lawrence's cell she can make confession and be married .
Here's a drink .
You mean however they dare .
Out of love ?
The strangers are all gone .
I'm biting my thumb .
She is in a better place .
Well , Susan died and is with God .
Let me be put to death .
Death has sucked the honey from your breath , but it has not yet ruined your beauty .
If the news is good , you're ruining the sweet news by playing a trick with a sour face like that .
Romeo killed Tybalt .
Where is my mother ?
A dog from that house will make me angry enough to take a stand .
Romeo , are you crazy ?
I had only one child , one poor child , one poor and loving child , the one thing I had to rejoice and comfort myself , and cruel Death has stolen it from me !
Oh my , Oh my !
Now , I swear by Saint Peter's Church and Peter too , he will not make me a joyful bride there .
Out here everybody can see us .
You can't get out of trouble by praying or crying , so don't bother .
Alright , here's the vial .
Oh , my liege , my wife died tonight .
You'll find me ready enough to do that , sir , if you give me a reason .
Be happy that you're alive .
Romeo , get out of here .
Hide yourself , good Romeo .
Oh , he's like a snake disguised as a flower .
Give me comfort .
What does Romeo say ?
We found him in the churchyard .
Your joke is a very bitter apple .
How can I bring those promises back down to earth , unless my husband sends them back down to me by dying and going to heaven ?
Is my father well ?
Now I must go to the tomb alone .
Where is she ?
Yes , this is what love does .
Tybalt , I have a reason to love you that lets me put aside the rage I should feel and excuse that insult .
Come here , man .
Let's get away , Tybalt .
How can this be ?
Amen , amen .
I'm smart enough to find the logs myself without bothering Peter .
Hey , love , I say !
If I answered that question , I'd be making confession to you .
She's too beautiful and too wise to deserve heaven's blessing by making me despair .
He's hiding out in Friar Lawrence's cell .
How is my Juliet ?
I want my sword .
Summertime in Verona has no flower as fine as him .
Have you come to make confession to this father ?
But I've been sent to find the people whose names are written on this list , and I can't read !
When evil is dominant , death soon kills the body like cancer .
You're not paying attention to me .
I scolded you for obsessing about her , not for loving her , my student .
They're looking for you in the great chamber .
Don't disturb the heavens any more by trying to go against heaven's will .
Oh , he's a lovely gentleman !
Well , we were all born to die .
By my count , I was already your mother at just about your age , while you remain a virgin .
Yes , " said my husband , "Did you fall on your face ?
You were never with me for anything if you weren't there for the goose .
Oh , Tybalt , Tybalt , he was the best friend I had .
She's dead , deceased , she's dead .
The Get out of here !
Well , that one , I think , is young Petruchio .
What I'm saying can't anger him .
Be honest and helpful , and I'll repay you for your efforts .
Oh , I'm very scared something awful has happened .
Peter !
If I can trust my dreams , then some joyful news is coming soon .
Do you need my help ?
I'm a friend , a friend who knows you well .
You can't talk about something that you don't feel .
Who should now pay the price for Mercutio's life ?
Have you killed Tybalt ?
Speak one rhyme , and I'll be satisfied .
And trust me , love , you look pale to me too .
For shame , bring Juliet out here .
It's out of fashion to give lengthy explanations like that .
Keep going , keep going , or I'll declare myself the winner .
The most you hope for was for her to marry wealthy and rise up the social ladder , that was your idea of heaven .
I hate my name , dear saint , because my name is your enemy .
If love plays rough with you , play rough with Come on , let's knock and go in .
Hey , bride !
They both begin with the letter "R." Ah , you jokester , that's the dog's name .
Alright , I will .
Madam , good night .
I'll look at him and try to like him , at least if what I see is likable .
If he says anything against me , I'll humble him , even if he were stronger than he is , and twenty punks like him .
Despised , distressed , hated , martyred , killed !
Come out , you frightened man .
Peter , wait for me at the gate .
Your humor is a spicy sauce .
What are you , girl ?
You're in love ?
Tell me , so I can cut it out of myself .
What ?
The Prince will give you the death penalty if you get caught .
Don't say "banishment." From now on , you are banished from Verona .
There's no point in looking for him if he doesn't want to be found .
Good and noble young man , don't mess with someone who's desperate .
My employer is as good as yours .
Oh , she shows the torches how to burn bright !
Benvolio is part of the Montague family .
Now I'll go see my priest , to ask for his help and tell him about my good luck .
You're like one of those guys who walks into a bar , slams his sword on the table , and then says , "I pray I never have to use you." By the time he orders his second drink , he pulls his sword on the bartender for no reason at all .
Go ask .
Only to be generous and give it to you once more .
Tomorrow I'll send the messenger .
Romeo killed Tybalt .
Lord , Lord , when she was a little baby , Oh , there is one nobleman in the city , a guy named Paris , who would be happy to claim her as his own .
Oh cousin , cousin !
Just look at me kindly , and I'm invincible against their hatred .
Give me my sin back .
Girls younger than she often marry and become happy mothers .
Your face is mine , and you have slandered it .
Educated men are so impressive !
If love is blind , it can't hit the target .
You disgust me , you little bug !
She's dead , she's dead , she's dead !
Good night .
I couldn't go to Mantua because I was stuck there .
Listen , because Tybalt was just killed , people might think that we don't care about his memory as our relative if we have too grand a party .
I'll find Romeo to comfort you .
My generosity to you is as limitless as the sea , and my love is as deep .
How long has he been there ?
Ha , ha !
Perhaps there's still some poison on them , to make me die with a medicinal kiss .
Let me keep weeping for such a great loss .
Therefore we'll have about half a dozen friends to the wedding , and that's it .
It's late .
Old Montague is here , and he's waving his sword around just to make me mad .
Everyone prepare to take this beautiful corpse to her grave .
I'll punish you so harshly that you'll regret causing me this loss .
This sight of death is like a bell that warns me I'm old and I'll die soon .
Groan ?
My master's house .
What's the problem , that they cry out so loud ?
To supper ?
What else is love ?
My noble uncle , do you know why he acts this way ?
He killed your relative , brave Mercutio , and then young Romeo killed him .
Mistress !
Noble Mercutio , put your sword away .
I know all of this .
As I slept under this yew-tree here , I had a dream that my master and someone else were fighting and that my master killed him .
Either you , or I , or both of us have to go with him .
Are you going ?
Look , sir , here comes the lady walking toward my cell .
What , are you busy ?
Madam .
They've turned me into food for worms .
I hate the word peace like I hate hell , all Montagues , and you .
Whichever of you acts shy , I'll swear she has corns .
I pledged my love to you before you asked me to .
If he's been killed , say "Yes." If not , say "No." These short words will determine my joy or my pain .
Well , you're not on target there .
Where is my Romeo ?
Yes she has , and by keeping celibate , she wastes her beauty .
I'll find your servant , and he'll update you now and then on your case as it stands here .
But tell me seriously who it is .
Oh , do you think we'll ever meet again ?
You'll Enough of this .
Are you trying to wash him out of his grave with tears ?
And you told me to bury my love .
Now you know the reason for the rush .
He's alive and victorious , and Mercutio's dead ?
Well then .
No , sir .
I'll go alone .
What strange reason could she have for coming here ?
Who's that calling so loud ?
I'll give my vile body back to the earth .
Then you were right on target .
Destructive thoughts come quickly to the minds of desperate men !
Oh , that's a joke made out of leather that spreads itself thin , from the width of an inch to as fat as a yard .
I swear , you speak the truth .
Here's Romeo's man .
I'll tell you before you have to ask me again .
I've said nothing wrong .
Romeo !
I'll go with you .
Good morning , father .
I'll be with you right away .
I'll come with you .
What do you mean I faked you out ?
Why , what's Tybalt's story ?
Leave him alone .
You know how young my daughter is .
Please , I beg you , don't scold me .
Now I'll tell you so you don't have to ask .
Let's go at it , coward !
Tybalt is lying over there .
How often tonight have my old feet stumbled on gravestones !
The woman I love is beautiful .
What must be will be .
Good morning , cousin .
My soul depends on it , A thousand times good night .
That dirty rat !
So the cooks who can't lick their fingers aren't hired .
Let's see how .
I hope you sleep peacefully .
I'll come back .
Oh friendly friar !
What about that ?
The sound of lovers calling each others names through the night is silver-sweet .
I'm a man , my lady , that God has made for himself to ruin .
He'll wake you up , I bet .
Romeo's a dishcloth compared to him .
Here comes my man , the man I'm looking for .
Then I'll call you a serving-creature .
Well , well , you have a careful father , child .
Oh , that most wicked fiend !
Life , wealth , everything belongs to Death .
I will leave here for Verona tonight .
And now you've changed ?
I headed toward him , but he saw me coming and hid in the woods .
I'll go , sir , and I won't bother you .
Some kind of fountain ?
Oh , then I see you've been with Who's Queen Mab ?
Oh , this is a painful time !
I can read .
I can tell you , but young Romeo will be older when you find him than he was when you started looking for him .
Let me stand here until you remember your reason .
Her blood has stopped , and her joints are stiff .
You were the prettiest baby I ever nursed .
Good night , good night .
Are you going to provoke me ?
I would have made it short .
I see .
Why are you still crying ?
Go .
Only God knows when we'll meet again .
Teach me to forget to think !
These times of pain are bad times for romance .
Oh sweet Nurse , what news do you bring ?
I'll fight you .
And with another for tying the new shoes he made with old laces ?
What do you say , James Well , I don't know what to say .
It's all the same .
We won't take their garbage .
Don't say anything .
He says more in one minute than he does in a whole month .
Oh wife , look at how our daughter bleeds !
What , are you hurt ?
But to say that Tybalt's dead and then say , "Romeo has been banished." To say that is like saying that my father , my mother , Tybalt , Romeo , and Juliet have all been killed , they're all dead .
Where's Potpan ?
No , cousin , I'm crying .
Hey !
What do you think about Thursday ?
I'm begging you , good Mercutio , let's call it a day .
You'll be sick tomorrow because you've stayed up all night .
On Thursday , sir ?
You mean I should groan and tell you ?
Peter !
Inside the little rind of this weak flower , there is both poison and powerful medicine .
It looks to me like it's burning in the Capulet tomb .
It did , it did .
But now I have joyful news for you , girl .
Death is my heir .
The cure for confusion is not yelling and screaming .
That banishment is worse than the murder of ten thousand Tybalts .
He locks himself up alone in his bedroom , shuts his windows to keep out the beautiful daylight , and makes himself an artificial night .
Flies can kiss her , but I must flee the city .
Should I believe that death is in love with you , and that the awful monster keeps you here to be his mistress ?
Be quick for a while and let the one who lives the longest take everything .
Oh , I wish she knew how much I love her .
Good afternoon , fair lady .
Young man , something's wrong if you're getting out of bed this early .
I'm finished .
Where are the evil men who started this fight ?
But I'm wishing for something I already have .
But go ahead and charm her , gentle Paris ; make her love you .
Romeo will thank you , my girl , for both of us .
Day has broken .
Romeo is hateful , even though God isn't .
How can you test them like that ?
Is that how it is , really ?
Cheers , boys .
Oh life !
I don't know his name .
This is the place .
Juliet lies here , and her beauty fills this tomb with light .
I wish I was your bird .
Everything you told me I already knew .
Was that my father who left here in such a hurry ?
This calm submission is dishonorable and vile .
Are you biting your thumb at us ?
Her eyes are saying something .
Don't say anything else .
Don't you have one word of joy ?
What's going on , Juliet ?
That can't be .
What do you want from me ?
How can I marry him , this husband , before he comes to court me ?
I see that you are poor .
Oh luck , luck .
Take away the stools , the sideboards , and the plates .
She's shut inside a dead man's tomb !
I think it's too rough , too rude , too rowdy , and it pricks like a thorn .
Believe me , I'm sorry you're in pain .
We're talking here in a public place .
But please tell me , can you read anything you see ?
Yes , I know her age down to the hour .
Yes , well , things could get better .
I sink under the heavy weight of love .
Climb up to her bedroom and comfort her .
Please , young man , don't make me angry .
Angry enough to run away .
I hope you're lucky enough to hear the true story by sticking around .
I will be brief because I'm not going to live long enough to tell a boring story .
Then who took my letter to Romeo ?
God forbid that I should prevent sacred devotion !
Farewell .
Now he's ready for
I'll go to lunch .
Ah sir , ah sir .
No we're not , it's night .
Well , do what you want .
I'll send my eyes to prison , and they'll never be free to look at anything again .
My words would bounce her to my sweet love , and his words would bounce her back to me .
Stop crying .
You are dead !
Tybalt wanted to kill you , but you killed Tybalt .
The wound can't be that bad .
This is a pitiful sight !
If you act like my daughter , I'll marry you to my friend .
Come along with me .
Who's the one who's going out the door right now ?
Tell me so I can be satisfied .
If you were ever yourself , and this sadness was yours , you and your sadness were all for Rosaline .
Why do you look so upset ?
I won't move to please anybody .
We took this pickax and this shovel from him , as he was walking from this side of the graveyard .
Then she is well , and nothing is wrong .
Please be quiet .
It's only just now nine o'clock .
She's calling out my name as if I were a bullet murdering her , just like I murdered her relative .
I have my naked sword out .
Cruel , cruel Death killed her .
Take me inside some house , Benvolio , or I'll pass out .
You scolded me often for loving Rosaline .
Call to him , Mercutio .
I'm suddenly afraid .
I won't hide unless all the mist from my heartsick groans envelopes me like fog and conceals me from people's searching eyes .
Within an hour , one of my men will come to you behind the abbey wall and give you a rope ladder .
Their unfortunate deaths put an end to their parents ' feud .
I'd give anything to keep them from seeing you here .
Oh , I was such a beast to be angry at him .
Did a dragon ever hide in such a beautiful cave ?
So , goodbye .
There are two opposite elements in everything , in men as well as in herbs , good and evil .
Give me some comfort , Nurse .
There's still a stain on your cheek from an old tear that hasn't been washed off yet .
How sweet it would be to actually have the woman I love , when merely thinking about love makes me so happy .
More and more pain for us .
Go tell him about this .
Don't talk back to me .
Romeo !
Good morning , gentlemen .
My dream told me that dreamers often lie .
And aren't you a Montague ?
But a lot of old people act like they're already dead , sluggish , slow , fat , and colorless , like lead .
I hear some noise .
My child , my reason for living , wake up , look up , or I'll die with you !
If they see you , they'll murder you .
You won't , then ?
My lord , I wish Thursday were tomorrow .
Perhaps you've learned from life and not from books .
I must hide in the darkness for awhile .
Because it's dark out , I'm afraid all this is just a dream , too sweet to be real .
Run to the Capulets .
You're making such a fuss .
Welcome , gentlemen .
Your head is as full of fights as an egg is full of yolk , but your head has been beaten like scrambled eggs from so much fighting .
I am content , if that's the way you want it .
No , it's not as deep as a well , or as wide as a church door , but it's enough .
Flies are like free men , but I have been banished .
Do you hear me ?
What kind of man are you ?
There's two , a man and a woman .
What if this mixture doesn't work at all ?
What's this ?
Thursday is coming .
You know where I live .
You have to contradict me , do you ?
The wind you're talking about is blowing us off our course .
They lie in bed while they dream about the truth .
I'll bite my thumb at them .
Do as you please , because I'm done worrying about you .
So what ?
Those who rush stumble and fall .
What ?
Tell me , my daughter Juliet , what is your attitude about getting married ?
Wretched boy , you hung out with him here , and you're going to go to heaven with him .
I won't tolerate him .
Monday !
That is the key to long-lasting love .
Oh , he's acting just like Juliet , just like her .
Where else would she be ?
You take your beauty sleep now .
That's the way to show me friendship .
Listen , your Romeo will be here tonight .
Your love will use it to climb up to your window while it's dark .
We mean well by going to this masquerade ball , but it's not smart of us to go .
Yes , yes , this is the rope ladder .
Oh , I'll rest here forever .
So , where should we eat ?
I won't break this promise .
This is good .
Don't " Yes , Nurse , what about that ?
There is nothing on Earth that is so evil that it does not provide the earth with some special quality .
Tybalt is dead , and Romeo has been banished."
For Juliet's sake , for her sake , rise and stand up .
Well , well , I don't care .
Yes , madam , he lies beyond my reach .
I've been hurt .
Tonight I'm having a feast that we've celebrated for many years .
Who greets me so early in the morning ?
Too fast is as bad as too slow .
What kind of devil are you to torture me like this ?
With Rosaline , father ?
I don't know , and he won't tell me .
I have forgotten why I called you back .
Let's go there .
Some say the lark makes a sweet division between day and night .
That fair-skinned , hard-hearted hussy , Rosaline is going to torment him until he goes insane .
She's not even fourteen .
It's been longer , it's been longer .
Curse the day this happened , but it did .
Leave me alone for a minute .
Whether it's even or odd , of all the days in the year , on the night of Lammas Eve , she'll be fourteen .
No , Romeo will respond to the letter's writer , telling him whether he accepts the challenge .
Are you really going to tell me that ?
At my humble house tonight , you can expect to see dazzling stars that walk on the ground and light the sky from below .
What ?
It's a good thing you're not a piece of fish .
Isn't she proud of such a match ?
O flesh , flesh , you've turned pale and weak like a fish .
Yes , a thousand times .
And Juliet's just as much in love as he , but she has even less opportunity to meet her lover .
It's not earlier than that , I tell you .
Just ignore him .
Here is a friar who's trembling , sighing and weeping .
And it's good to have joy in such a joyless time .
I pay you because you're poor , not because you want me to buy this .
And what about that ?
Can God be so jealous and hateful ?
You But , uncle , we're being disrespected .
Don't stay here , go away .
Well , Juliet , I'll lie with you tonight .
Is it really true ?
Oh , there's my lady !
It is , it is .
You'll fight with a man who's cracking nuts just because you have hazelnut-colored eyes .
If I live to see you get married someday , all my wishes will come true .
Tell her about my son Paris's love for her .
Don't worry about me .
What a man , young lady .
Now you're Romeo .
Rust inside my body and let me die .
Oh God , did Romeo's hand shed Tybalt's blood ?
You're right .
Hurry up , hurry up .
Curse the day !
So to be banished from Verona is like being banished from the world , and being banished from the world is death .
Look , look !
That knife should be in its sheath on that Montague's back , but instead it's mis-sheathed in my daughter's breast .
That sounds like the voice of Friar John .
That's really news !
If you're a member of a divine spiritual order of men who forgive sins , and you say you're my friend , how do you have the heart to mangle me with the word banishment ?
You won't stand and fight .
If I can't do it myself , I'll find someone who can .
God bless you !
I have news for you about the Prince's punishment .
If that's not the case , then this must be the answer : You , Romeo , have not been to bed tonight .
Flies are healthier and more honorable and better suited for romance than Romeo .
It's a sweet lozenge that you choke on .
She's dead , like a beautiful flower , killed by an unseasonable frost .
I don't like it .
Curse your families !
Where is my husband ?
Oh Friar , damned souls use the word banishment to describe hell .
The boy is warning me that someone approaches .
Why did this have to happen now ?
This makes me feel so much better !
If you who are so wise can't help , please be kind enough to call my solution wise .
Send for the Count .
Unhappy fortune !
Leaving you is a thousand times worse than being near you .
Then hurry up and rush over to Friar Lawrence's cell .
May a plague strike both your houses .
They howl about banishment .
I'm involved in your rivalry .
How can you be out of breath when you have enough breath to tell me that you're out of breath ?
Come on , what did Romeo say ?
I'm done for .
Come on , you can be as angry as any guy in Italy when you're in the mood .
I don't dare , sir .
Investigate how this foul murder came about .
Or , if he wrote down his thoughts , give me his letter .
Therefore , the fact that you're awake this early tells me you've been upset with some anxiety .
Why the hell did you come in between us ?
That's because the murderer is alive .
It's not the right time to play .
Lie down right there .
Go with me to the tomb .
I can tell by his voice that this man is a Montague .
It's not true because she separates us .
What did my man say ?
I can imagine more than I can say , I have more on my mind than words .
Hey , are you biting your thumb at us ?
He was my brother's son !
There was no need to tell me to get out of there .
We shouldn't have too big a celebration , we can invite a friend or two .
But I am thankful that you have found it .
I will .
I enjoyed a sweeter rest than sleep .
Let them judge us however they please .
I'm glad he wasn't here for this fight .
Three words , dear Romeo , and then it's good night for real .
His drugs work quickly .
Look , and you'll see .
Therefore your relatives are no obstacle .
Brother , hey !
I don't know , sir .
No , not a sad song .
May God choose you to receive his grace .
Delay this marriage for a month , or a week .
That guy's funny .
I have already condemned and excused myself .
Where are my father and my mother , Nurse ?
That light is not daylight , I know it .
Don't deny to him that you love me .
She's ready to go , but she'll never return .
Day and night , hour after hour , all the time , at work , at play , alone , in company , my top priority has always been to find her a husband .
Come on , you're being ridiculous !
Tomorrow is Wednesday .
Oh , good , a knife !
Death , which has taken her away to make me cry , now ties up my tongue and won't let me speak .
Seriously , cousin , I love a woman .
So stop crying .
Before I could break up the fight , Tybalt was killed .
Oh God ! , Oh Nurse , how can this be stopped ?
I swear to you by my virginity at age twelve , I already told her to come .
That rotten scoundrel !
Therefore , love each other in moderation .
Oh love !
Then I rebel against you , stars !
We're bound to each other in every possible way , except we need you to marry us .
Come , night .
Nurse ?
I drew my sword to part them .
A beautiful target is the one that gets hit the fastest .
Poison , I see , has been the cause of his death .
God in heaven bless her !
A little bit of grief shows a lot of love .
Oh , you're wrong .
If we look like musicians to you , you can expect to hear nothing but noise .
Oh , go away !
Give my regards to your lady , and tell her to hurry everybody in the house to bed .
But where have you been ?
Goodbye , Goodbye !
Be good .
Then I'll really give it to you .
Lord , Lord , she'll be a happy woman .
Take this .
Please , follow straight after me .
So now turn and draw your sword .
You're whiter than snow on the black wings of a raven .
Why , isn't all this joking better than groaning about love ?
Curse the day !
Romeo is coming .
I don't have the thing that makes time fly .
What is this blood that stains the stony entrance of this tomb ?
He made this rope ladder to be a highway to my bed , but I am a virgin , and I will die a virgin and a widow .
It is the east , and Juliet is the sun .
I'm done for in this world , I believe .
Any man who knows how to write can answer a letter .
The groans you used to make are still ringing in my old ears .
Go to bed , dear .
Tybalt's death would be bad enough if that was all .
It was .
Showing mercy by pardoning killers only causes more murders .
That's foolish .
Holy Franciscan Friar !
Do you have news from Verona ! , What is it , Balthasar ?
Good father , I'm begging you on my knees , be patient and listen to me say just one thing .
Oh my , what's the news ?
It's the lark that sings so out of tune , making such harsh noise .
Two unlucky children of these enemy families become lovers and commit suicide .
If you were as young as I am , if you were in love with Juliet , if you had just married her an hour ago , if then you murdered Tybalt , if you were lovesick like me , and if you were banished , then you might talk about it .
Give me those flowers .
Her body sleeps in the Capulet tomb , and her immortal soul lives with the angels in heaven .
Are you this impatient ?
I'll conjure him as if I were summoning a spirit .
Come on , wake up , wake up , wake up !
Curse my very heart , but I think you should be happy in this second marriage , because it's better than your first .
Oh , sad day !
I ask that again because nothing can be wrong if she is well .
Then isn't it just the right dish for a sweet goose ?
Lucentio's son is older than that , sir .
Boy , your words can't excuse the harm you've done to me .
I will kiss your lips .
How is my wife ?
Hurry up , it's getting late .
Are you speaking from your heart ?
Be merciful and say "death." Exile is much worse than death .
You're Pull out your tool now .
Sweet , sweet , sweet Nurse , tell me , what did my love Romeo say ?
May a plague curse both your families .
Romeo , are you going to your father's for lunch ?
Up .
Do you love me ?
You have the sacred power to cure both of us .
Now you're sociable .
He was not born to be shameful .
Is that the rope ladder Romeo told you to pick up ?
From now on , take care of your messages yourself .
I'm sure you have your hands full preparing for the sudden festivities .
Brother , I'll go and bring it to you .
Sweet Montague , be true .
Where do you come from ?
He's dead .
My lord , you're wrong to berate her like that .
That villain , Romeo .
She was too good for me .
I'm at your service .
I Let's not break the law by starting a fight .
Within three hours Juliet will wake up .
There has never been so black a day as today .
I'm locked up in a prison and deprived of food .
You'll fall backward when you grow up , won't you , Jule ? " And she stopped crying and said , "Yes." Now you stop too , Nurse , please .
She will A pimp !
Do as I tell you .
They should get to bed early and get plenty of sleep .
To our house .
If everything else fails , at least I have the power to take my own life .
Were you talking about Juliet ?
He's not the most polite man in the world , but , believe me , he's gentle as a lamb .
I saw her buried in her family's tomb , and then I came here to tell you the news .
Then I'll smack you on the head with the serving-creature's knife .
Well , death is the end for everybody .
I had a dream last night .
I am the youngest man by that name , because there is no one younger , or worse .
What satisfaction could you possibly have tonight ?
My baby hawk ?
He's a raven with the feathers of the dove .
Then the window lets day in , and life goes out the window .
Benvolio , who started this fight ?
Who is her mother ?
I'll never be satisfied with Romeo until I see him .
Now , fellow , what have you got there ?
I'll confess to you that I love him .
Is it young Romeo ?
Where the devil can Romeo be ?
He looks skinny , like a dried herring without its eggs , and he hasn't got his girl .
I do .
They're calling for dates and quinces in the pastry kitchen .
Have you done everything you could to make him tell you the reason ?
Men's eyes were made to see things , so let them watch .
And why did you come ?
Give it to me !
Take my remark in whichever sense you like .
Have a nice day !
Who is it ?
We don't need to hear it .
Or should we enter without apologizing ?
I'm losing this duel of wits .
Well , you have given me great comfort .
What , are you crazy ?
Don't think about her .
Somebody's knocking .
Hurry up , or I'll smack you on the ears with my sword before you have yours drawn .
Romeo must die .
What an awful day !
He ran this way and jumped over this orchard wall .
I'll bite you on the ear for that joke .
Nurse , where's my daughter ?
I can't believe that dog , that rat , that mouse , that cat could scratch me to death !
I swear to you , You have a good heart , and believe me , I'll tell her that .
Why are you waiting ?
I want to take the love I had for my cousin and take it out on the body of the man who killed him .
Show yourself in the form of a sigh .
You pale face !
You won't get any bad cooks from me .
Go wake Juliet .
Oh , are you going to leave me so unsatisfied ?
Yes , boy , I'm ready .
Now , before the sun comes up and burns away the dew , I have to fill this basket of mine with poisonous weeds and medicinal flowers .
I can see in your eyes that you're starving .
I don't want to dance .
Nurse , will you come with me to my closet and help me pick out the clothes and the jewelry I'll need to wear tomorrow ?
If her eyes were in the night sky , they would shine so brightly through space that birds would start singing , thinking her light was the light of day .
Speak , nephew .
She's not even fourteen years old .
I'm not going to bed tonight .
Mercutio , be quiet .
Find out the way , and I'll find the right man .
Yes , let the count take you in your bed .
Your wild actions resemble the irrational fury of a beast .
I hear you say "proud" and "I thank you , " and then "no thank you" and "not proud , " you spoiled little girl .
Let's go !
Didn't you argue it out with your tailor for wearing one of his new suits before the right season ?
A jumbled confession can only receive a jumbled absolution .
Don't talk to me , because I won't say a word .
Tell me , my good friend , what is that light over there ?
Pick up this rope ladder .
In the beautiful city of Verona , where our story takes place , a long-standing hatred between two families erupts into new violence , and citizens stain their hands with the blood of their fellow citizens .
Oh Romeo , Romeo , brave Mercutio is dead !
How should madmen hear , if wise men can't even see ?
Why , she's inside .
Where's Romeo ?
There's plenty of time .
Saints don't move , even when they grant prayers .
Holy Saint Francis , this is a drastic change !
If you sink , you're dragging love down .
Here comes the furious Tybalt back again .
Tell me if it's good or bad , and I'll wait for the details .
Hey , lady !
We can't be in two places at once , both here and there !
Go on , go on .
Give me your hand .
Come , come away .
I can only repeat what I've said before .
That might be the case sir ,
If any of my relatives find you here they'll kill you because of who you are .
Take Cupid's wings and fly higher than the average man .
Listen , she loved her cousin Tybalt dearly , and so did I .
Have you spoken to him ?
But I won't let myself fall for him any more than your permission allows .
It is an honor that I do not dream of .
Who are you ?
Indeed , my child , at Saint Peter's Church early Thursday morning , the gallant , young , and noble gentleman Count Paris will happily make you a joyful bride .
If my heart's dear love , Well , don't swear .
My daughter is still very young .
Some people in the street are crying "Romeo." Some are crying "Juliet , " and some are crying "Paris." They're all running in an open riot toward our tomb .
Here are forty ducats .
Oh , a footstep as light as hers will never endure the rocky road of life .
It's someone with a torch !
Now , good sweet Nurse , Oh Lord , why do you look so sad ?
Oh Lord , they're fighting !
Oh , noble prince , I can tell you everything about the unfortunate circumstances of this deadly fight .
So I die with a kiss .
Answer me like men .
Wait .
Have you seen him today ?
Farewell !
Hold the friar too .
Don't tell me that you've heard about this marriage , Friar , unless you can tell me how to prevent it .
I'll follow after you .
Isn't that what he said ?
Let's talk .
She's lying on the ground just like him , blubbering and weeping , weeping and blubbering .
Well , we can put away our pipes and go home .
You're an insolent little boy .
You have the best sorts of happiness to enjoy .
I'll make you sing .
His face will make the heavens so beautiful that the world will fall in love with the night and forget about the garish sun .
I'll forget that I have any home besides this spot right here .
Maybe she can't find him .
Oh my !
Thank you , dear Nurse .
Go blabber with your gossiping friends .
Are you going to join them ?
Romeo ran away when Tybalt fell dead .
And then I'll be the leader of pain , and maybe I'll lead you as far as death .
No , not until Thursday .
If there were two men like you , pretty soon there'd be none because the two of you would kill each other .
Oh , poor Romeo !
My sweet , so do I .
Is the news good or bad ?
But whatever misfortunes occur , they can't ruin the joy I feel with one look at her .
I asked a servant .
We're ruined , lady , we're ruined !
Ah , Juliet if you're as happy as I am , and you're better with words , tell me about the happiness you imagine we'll have in our marriage .
Either go someplace private , or talk it over rationally , or else just go away .
What time tomorrow should I send a messenger to you ?
Madam , I am not well .
Oh God , I have a soul that predicts evil things !
Oh heavens !
Hurry up , I say .
Every old man has worries , and worried men never get any sleep , but young men shouldn't have a care in the world .
What , you don't say a word ?
She was tricked , divorced , wronged , spited , killed !
In the meantime I wrote to Romeo and told him to come here on this awful night to help remove her from her temporary grave when the sleeping potion wore off .
Tonight she is shut up in her room , alone with her sadness .
For himself to ruin , " he says .
I am no villain .
I'm not one of his punk friends who carries a knife .
No gentlemen , don't get ready to go now .
You kiss like you've studied how .
We'll have the wedding at the church tomorrow .
Go there and compare her objectively to some other girls I'll show you .
Tell us what you know about this affair .
Have you given up so quickly on Rosaline , whom you loved so much ?
Don't let the Nurse stay with you in your bedroom .
You don't know how to pick a man .
Well , what was your dream ?
And now you cry , even though she has risen up above the clouds , as high as heaven itself ?
Go , you old housewife , go .
Then do my lips now have the sin they took from yours ?
Everybody knows I'm a nice piece of flesh .
Have some others search .
Can't you wait for a moment ?
A grave ?
I'm not here .
As we were trading blows , more and more people showed up to join the fight , until the Prince came and broke everyone up .
But I can't help laughing to think that the baby stopped crying and said , "Yes." I swear , she had a bump on her forehead as big as a rooster's testicle .
Then young men love with their eyes , not with their hearts .
Put it together with something else .
And then , I hope , you'll be satisfied .
His arrow has pierced me too deeply , so I can't fly high with his cheerful feathers .
Ah , where's my servant ? , Give me some brandy. , These griefs , these pains , these sorrows make me old .
Come , I'll place you among the sisterhood of holy nuns .
Where ?
There's a husband there who's waiting to make you his wife .
No , not him , though his face is more handsome than any man's , and his legs are prettier , and as for his hands and feet and body , they're not much to speak of , and yet they're beyond compare .
It is written that shoemakers and tailors should play with each others ' tools , that fisherman should play with paints , and painters should play with with fishing nets .
Romeo will answer the challenge .
Oh , brother Montague , give me your hand .
But he has to make his speeches of love to a woman who's supposed to be his enemy .
Goodbye .
Beat them down !
This fight will decide who dies .
Two of the brightest stars in the whole sky had to go away on business , and they're asking her eyes to twinkle in their places until they return .
I hope sores cover your tongue for a wish like that !
Tybalt , old Capulet's nephew , has sent a letter to Romeo's father's house .
But if you have to swear , swear by your wonderful self , which is the god I worship like an idol , and then I'll believe you .
A greater power than we can fight has ruined our plan .
Goodbye .
Answer that question .
Capulet , you villain !
Who's ruining my rituals of true love ?
Holy Father Lawrence instructed me to fall on my knees and beg your forgiveness .
Was there ever such an evil book with such a beautiful cover ?
Well , sir , my mistress is the sweetest lady .
Death is my son-in-law .
The world doesn't make laws to make you rich .
Come , come with me , and we'll do the job quickly .
What will we say is our excuse for being here ?
Is this the cure for my aching bones ?
Wait , Tybalt , wait !
You should be able to endure this because the world is broad and wide .
You will feel the loss , but the man you weep for will feel nothing .
I'm not one of his sluts .
Are you going to say good things about the man who killed your cousin ?
Let it go .
Onward , lover boys !
I can tell that you don't know who I am .
My head is pounding .
Here comes your father .
You would fight with a man if he had one more whisker or one less whisker in his beard than you have in your beard .
Aren't you Romeo ?
He struck me from under your arm .
Hit them !
My soul and not my child !
I think he told me Paris was about to marry Juliet .
Now I see the blood rushing to your cheeks .
Madam , if you can find a man to deliver the poison , I'll mix it myself so that Romeo will sleep quietly soon after he drinks it .
Ha , banishment ?
I wish that no one could avenge my cousin's death except me !
I'll go and chat with Paris .
Don't reply .
May God in heaven bless you .
Farewell , farewell !
Down with the Capulets !
His son was a minor only two years ago .
What is the matter ?
But what do you say to my request ?
I'll be a harsh master to them .
I won't miss any chance to send my love to you .
What's this noise ?
That's three hours since nine o'clock , but she hasn't come back .
Where is my page ?
Your Juliet is alive .
Use your clubs and spears !
I have time for you now , my sad daughter .
Well , that's an Stay , fellow .
Your last guess is right .
Let playful people with light hearts dance .
I'm only trying to keep the peace .
I make her angry sometimes by saying that Paris is more handsome than you are .
Sometimes she rides over a courtier's lips , and he dreams of making money off of someone .
Yes , if I know the language and the letters .
You foolish madman , listen to me for a moment .
Yet I wish I could take that promise back , so I had it to give again .
Your love says , like an honorable gentleman , 'Where is your mother ?
Give me my fan , Peter .
Welcome , gentlemen .
Go away and stay apart from me .
Where are they supposed to come ?
Why would you do that , my love ?
I met the young man at Lawrence's cell .
Romeo , Romeo , Romeo !
Do so , and tell my sweet to be ready to scold me .
Excuse me , sir , do you know how to read ?
Give me your torch , boy .
When only one or two men have all the good manners , and even they are dirty , things are bad .
Sin from my lips ?
I'll bury you in a magnificent grave .
Let me tell you , the man who marries her will become very wealthy .
Oh , Juliet , I already know about your sad situation .
Very well taken , I believe , very wise .
Now heaven has her .
So did I .
Well , sir , because silver has a sweet sound .
Good night .
Sadness over my son's exile stopped her breath .
I'll send a man to Mantua , where that exiled rogue is living .
Please , sir , have patience .
Take a little vacation in Mantua .
That is a certain truth .
Amen !
Oh , it is my love .
Romeo cried out , "Stop , my friends .
If you could , you couldn't bring him back to life .
Sweetheart !
But I'll write again to Mantua , and I'll keep her in my cell until Romeo comes .
