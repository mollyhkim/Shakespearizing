Farewell .
Besides , Antonio certified the Duke They were not with Bassanio in his ship .
If all the wine in my bottle will recover him , I will help his ague .
He supped at my house , but I therefore shake not .
Beware the ides of March .
That a monster should be such a natural !
My lord , his throat is cut .
Let not my worser spirit tempt me again To die before you please .
Catesby .
Go you with me and I will use your skill. , Good cousin , have a care this busy time .
Th' art an honest man .
Speak , man .
That is done , sir .
Well , praised be the gods for thy foulness ; sluttishness may come hereafter .
Thus it remains , and the remainder thus .
Ay .
Looks he as freshly as he did the day he wrestled ?
Her name is Katherina Minola , Renowned in Padua for her scolding tongue .
Give me that boy and I will go with thee .
I am stuffed , cousin .
It beckons you to go away with it , As if it some impartment did desire To you alone .
Is not this something more than fantasy ?
Celerity is never more admired Than by the negligent .
At a word , I am not .
I will deny thee nothing !
In this slumbery agitation , besides her walking and other actual performances , what , at any time , have you heard her say ?
I must eat my dinner .
Can any of your neighbors tell , Kate ?
Would I might never O'ertake pursued success , but I do feel , By the rebound of yours , a grief that smites My very heart at root .
The fool will stay .
Tush , fear not , man .
I am very glad of it .
Take a trumpet , herald .
I say "amen."
First let me talk with this philosopher. ,
This week he hath been heavy , sour , sad , And much different from the man he was .
This night , wherein the cub-drawn bear would couch , The lion and the belly-pinched wolf Keep their fur dry , unbonneted he runs , And bids what will take all .
And what of him ?
Maid's mild behavior and sobriety .
It struck mine ear most terribly .
Wooed me to steal it , but she so loves the token ( For he conjured her she should ever keep it ) That she reserves it evermore about her To kiss and talk to .
Half-blooded fellow , yes .
My mind is changed .
There thou mayst brain him , Having first seized his books ; or with a log Batter his skull ; or paunch him with a stake ; Or cut his weasand with thy knife .
I am given , sir , secretly to understand that your younger brother Orlando hath a disposition to come in disguised against me to try a fall .
His bark is stoutly timbered and his pilot Of very expert and approved allowance Therefore my hopes , not surfeited to death , Stand in bold cure .
Why , what should be the fear ?
It is the devil .
Call !
One minded like the weather , most unquietly .
How canst thou urge God's dreadful law to us When thou hast broke it in such dear degree ?
Alack , alack the day !
But , Roderigo , if thou hast that in thee indeed , which I have greater reason to believe now than ever , I mean purpose , courage and valor , this night show it .
Hear the shrill whistle , which doth order give To sounds confused .
Thy shape invisible retain thou still .
But did I never speak of all that time ?
And I another So weary with disasters , tugged with fortune , That I would set my life on any chance , To mend it or be rid on 't .
But well and free , If thou so yield him , there is gold , and here My bluest veins to kiss , a hand that kings Have lipped , and trembled kissing .
I must leave them and seek some better service .
For he is , sure , i ' th ' island .
But till this afternoon his passion Ne'er brake into extremity of rage .
Return , good Catesby , to the gracious duke .
Are they all ready ?
How now , sir ?
Oh , farewell !
He hath been a courtier , he swears .
And how besides thyself ?
I will be more jealous of thee than a Barbary cock- pigeon over his hen , more clamorous than a parrot against rain , more newfangled than an ape , more giddy in my desires than a monkey .
None , but your beauty .
Let us swear That you are worth your breeding , which I doubt not ,
Why , then , we kill all our women .
Repose you there , while I to this hard house , More harder than the stones whereof 'tis raised , Which even but now , demanding after you , Denied me to come in , return , and force Their scanted courtesy .
We'll go along together , And ere we have thy youthful wages spent , We'll light upon some settled low content .
Good your grace , pardon me .
Avaunt , thou witch ! , Come , Dromio , let us go .
Who hath he left behind him general ?
There are my keys. , But wherefore should I go ?
So frowned he once when , in an angry parle , He smote the sledded Polacks on the ice .
It should seem then that Dobbin's tail grows backward .
Do , good William .
What a fearful night is this !
Be not ta'en tardy by unwise delay .
O day untowardly turned !
Where shall we go ?
Thou seest we are not all alone unhappy .
My lord , I know not what the matter is , but to my judgment your highness is not entertained with that ceremonious affection as you were wont .
As I did stand my watch upon the hill , I looked toward Birnam , and anon methought The wood began to move .
Twill be a storm .
Ha !
He , sir , that must marry this woman .
I can not live out of her company .
Good now , some excellent fortune !
His taints and honors Waged equal with him .
Wherefore did you so ?
Call 'em .
If thou didst ever thy dear father love , O God !
Come .
Now , by yon marble heaven , In the due reverence of a sacred vow I here engage my words .
Base is the slave that pays .
Pray ye , go .
So he does indeed .
I have o'ershot myself to tell you of it .
Methinks I hear Antony call .
If much you note him , You shall offend him and extend his passion .
And therefore as a stranger give it welcome .
I'll know thy thoughts .
There's comfort yet ; they are assailable .
But fish not with this melancholy bait For this fool gudgeon , this opinion. , Come , good Lorenzo. , Fare ye well awhile .
I know , sir , I am no flatterer .
Know , my long lord , The marquess Dorset , as I hear , is fled To Richmond , in the parts where he abides .
This courtesy , forbid thee , shall the duke Instantly know , and of that letter too .
But thou with mildness entertain'st thy wooers , With gentle conference , soft and affable .
One way I like this well .
You must not deny me .
Would it were mortal poison for thy sake .
I will walk up and down here and I will sing , that they shall hear I am not afraid .
Which he will put on us as pigeons feed their young .
Why then , 'tis good to be a post .
This day , great duke , she shut the doors upon me While she with harlots feasted in my house .
Tell me , Othello .
How if they will not ?
Your cause of sorrow Must not be measured by his worth , for then It hath no end .
Marry , heaven forbid !
The shame itself doth speak For instant remedy .
Let's meet him and receive him .
It is not day .
Adieu .
He is attended with a desperate train .
These deeds must not be thought After these ways .
An Englishman ?
Haply I see a friend will save my life And pay the sum that may deliver me .
A man is master of his liberty ; Time is their master , and when they see time They'll go or come .
She's gone forever .
Then how can it be said I am alone When all the world is here to look on me ?
Yearly will I do this rite .
Goneril with a white beard ?
Whoe'er he be that in this foul proceeding Hath thus beguiled your daughter of herself And you of her , the bloody book of law You shall yourself read in the bitter letter , After your own sense , yea , though our proper son Stood in your action .
Go carry them and smear The sleepy grooms with blood .
You shall do small respect , show too bold malice Against the grace and person of my master , Stocking his messenger .
Well , sir , in brief , the gown is not for me .
To Adriana .
Wherein , my friends , have I offended you ?
Why then , good night indeed .
False-boding woman , end thy frantic curse , Lest to thy harm thou move our patience .
It was he That made the overture of thy treasons to us , Who is too good to pity thee .
Let not the heavens hear these telltale women Rail on the Lord's anointed .
We did , my lord , weeping and commenting Upon the sobbing deer .
The rate , Well , Shylock , shall we be beholding to you ?
The noble Brutus Hath told you Caesar was ambitious .
Let me lick thy shoe .
Thy love ?
They are sick ?
What's he That was not born of woman ?
Good meat , sir , is common ; that every churl affords .
That you should think we come not to offend , But with good will .
I'll come to thee straight .
Hear Antony .
By Him that raised me to this careful height From that contented hap which I enjoyed , I never did incense his majesty Against the duke of Clarence , but have been An earnest advocate to plead for him .
Grace go with you , sir .
For the table , sir , it shall be served in .
If you have any music that may not be heard , to 't again .
Wast thou not charged at peril , Wherefore to Dover ? , Let him first answer that .
I'll leave thee Now like a man of steel .
So I hope .
What would you with me , honest neighbor ?
I'll have my bond , and therefore speak no more .
Now show the wound mine eye hath made in thee .
Do you intend it ?
Being entertained for a perfumer , as I was smoking a musty room , comes me the Prince and Claudio , hand in hand , in sad conference .
Was 't not to this end That thou began'st to twist so fine a story ?
This , Casca .
What , thou speak'st drowsily ?
Nothing , my lord .
True or false , it hath made thee Earl of Gloucester .
Through the house give glimmering light , By the dead and drowsy fire .
God's bodykins , man , much better .
Come hither , Leonato .
Fulvia is dead .
It is your music , madam , of the house .
Crystal is muddy .
They'll mar my counterfeiting .
The Moor replies That he you hurt is of great fame in Cyprus And great affinity , and that in wholesome wisdom He might not but refuse you .
An't please your Honor , players That offer service to your Lordship .
I found him here as melancholy as a lodge in a warren .
And now I'll do 't .
Not a whit , Touchstone .
Minion , your dear lies dead , And your unblest fate hies .
What man dost thou dig it for ?
Poor Turlygod ! " "Poor Tom ! " , That's something yet .
If this be so , why blame you me to love you ?
I have done .
Perforce I must confess I thought you lord of more true gentleness .
The last she spake Was "Antony , most noble Antony ! " Then in the midst a tearing groan did break The name of Antony .
God's will and His pleasure , Captain , I beseech you now , come apace to the king .
There are some shrewd contents in yond same paper That steals the color from Bassanio's cheek .
By such despair I should accuse myself .
Then you are a better than the king .
Yes , you have seen Cassio and she together .
Lysander and myself will fly this place .
Ay , good my lord .
I shall take it , sir .
Madam , I'll take my leave .
And though she be but little , she is fierce .
Went'st not thou to her for a purse of ducats ?
My children too ?
In which array , brave soldier , doth he lie , Larding the plain , and by his bloody side , Yoke-fellow to his honor-owing wounds , The noble earl of Suffolk also lies .
I took no more pains for those thanks than you took pains to thank me." That's as much as to say , "Any pains that I take for you is as easy as thanks." If I do not take pity of her , I am a villain .
Is thy name William ?
You have been hotly called for .
Go put on thy defenses .
So will it , madam till I lie with you .
You do love my lord .
There's my hand .
Or if thou follow me , do not believe But I shall do thee mischief in the wood .
This tempest will not give me leave to ponder On things would hurt me more .
This is his sword .
Have at you now !
Come , my sweet Kate .
Once more , good night , kind lords and gentlemen .
O , he was gentle , mild , and virtuous .
O cursed , cursed slave !
Serve you , sir .
But it would better fit your honor to change your mind .
Where is he ?
Hush !
Not I , believe me .
To our shores Throng many doubtful hollow-hearted friends , Unarmed and unresolved to beat them back .
If you be well pleased with this And hold your fortune for your bliss , Turn you where your lady is And claim her with a loving kiss."
Signior Hortensio , come you to part the fray ?
For learn this , Silius : Better to leave undone than by our deed Acquire too high a fame when him we serve's away .
Sirrah , come hither : 'tis no time to jest , And therefore frame your manners to the time .
I can not speak your England .
Dost grant me , hedgehog ?
Thus ornament is but the guiled shore To a most dangerous sea , the beauteous scarf Veiling an Indian beauty , in a word , The seeming truth which cunning times put on To entrap the wisest .
Goblin , lead them up and down .
By Cheshu , he is an ass , as in the world .
Farewell , dear mother .
Fair princess , you have lost much good sport .
Let us go .
And these does she apply for warnings and portents And evils imminent , and on her knee Hath begged that I will stay at home today .
That lord that counseled thee To give away thy land , Come place him here by me .
Stay with us .
What in the contrary ?
What should the wars do with these jigging fools ?
Those of his chamber , as it seemed , had done 't .
I will do any thing , Nerissa , ere I'll be married to a sponge .
I say , but mark his gesture .
The man i ' th ' moon !
I would not follow him then .
In honored love .
If I should be ?
Fellow , wilt thou bestow thy time with me ?
For my part , I care not .
You minion , you , are these your customers ?
What might you think ?
Piece out our imperfections with your thoughts .
He did ask favor .
That our garments , being , as they were , drenched in the sea , hold notwithstanding their freshness and glosses , being rather new-dyed than stained with salt water .
No noise , and enter .
O braggart vile and damned furious wight , The grave doth gape , and doting death is near .
We will spare for no wit , I warrant you .
Go , bring them in. , And take your places , ladies .
That would I , were I of all kingdoms king .
If ever I live to see it , I will challenge it .
How 'gree you now ?
Thy truth then be thy dower .
This is thy office .
Tis thought that Richmond is their admiral ; And there they hull , expecting but the aid Of Buckingham to welcome them ashore .
Let me still take away the harms I fear , Not fear still to be taken .
Is 't true , is 't true ?
Draw up your powers .
is your merry humor altered ?
And you shall speak In the same pulpit whereto I am going , After my speech is ended .
Take it thankfully .
If I last in this service , you must case me in leather .
Not for the wide world .
I'll not deny him anything I have , No , not my body , nor my husband's bed .
Question : why , an hour in clamor and a quarter in rheum .
You bid me make it orderly and well , According to the fashion and the time .
Thou know'st 'tis common .
No , lad .
I found not Cassio's kisses on her lips .
If I had thee in Lipsbury pinfold , I would make thee care for me .
It hath not appeared .
I once more take my leave .
And I do think she's thirty .
I know no ways to mince it in love , but directly to say , "I love you." Then if you urge me farther than to say , "Do you , in faith ? " I wear out my suit .
I shall do 't .
But he that filches from me my good name Robs me of that which not enriches him And makes me poor indeed .
But now I was the lord Of this fair mansion , master of my servants , Queen o'er myself .
So , fare thee well .
Go bring the rabble , O'er whom I give thee power , here to this place .

We will have such a prologue , and it shall be written in eight and six .
One aloof stand sentinel .
But that's all one : omittance is no quittance .
Speak no more of him ; you'll be whipped for taxation one of these days .
Her father's brother Would be her lord ?
Believe me , I can not .
An interlude !
I do think there is mettle in death , which commits some loving act upon her , she hath such a celerity in dying .
The English are embattled , you French peers .
Good Grumio , fetch it me .
Let his shames quickly Drive him to Rome .
Keep thee warm .
Let the world see His nobleness well acted , which your death Will never let come forth .
When this burns , 'Twill weep for having wearied you .
I have locked the letter in my closet .
A fig !
As if time were in debt .
No , my good lord .
Crowner's quest law .
My duty to you both , on equal love , Great kings of France and England .
Favors ?
Hillo , ho , ho , boy .
I'll answer that .
Cursed be I that did so !
Do not presume too much upon my love .
peace , this piece of toasted cheese will do 't .
Fortune and Antony part here .
I see these witches are afraid of swords .
Why , stay and hear me speak .
But this eternal blazon must not be To ears of flesh and blood .
Betrayed I am .
Was not that letter from fair Jessica ?
Mooncalf , speak once in thy life , if thou beest a good mooncalf .
Well , as you guess ?
Poor Tom , thy horn is dry .
Thou art a strange fellow .
What we will do , we do upon command .
When 's god's asleep , he'll rob his bottle .
Yes , sir , I have indeed .
Though far more cause , yet much less spirit to curse Abides in me .
Caesar's .
O thou weed , Who art so lovely fair and smell'st so sweet That the sense aches at thee , would thou hadst ne'er been born !
What ceremony else ?
This is the foul fiend Flibbertigibbet .
Observe how Antony becomes his flaw , And what thou think'st his very action speaks In every power that moves .
Very foul .
Now , Catesby , what says your lord to my request ?
That she may long live here , God say amen .
Lay her a-hold , a-hold !
Bid him therefore consider of his ransom , which must proportion the losses we have borne , the subjects we have lost , the disgrace we have digested , which , in weight to reanswer , his pettiness would bow under .
The king's son have I landed by himself , Whom I left cooling of the air with sighs In an odd angle of the isle , and sitting , His arms in this sad knot .
Couch we a while and mark .
Must there no more be done ?
No , my good lord .
O dear father , It is thy business that I go about .
I know it pleaseth neither of us well .
Turn up on your right hand at the next turning , but at the next turning of all on your left .
And I the king shall love thee .
Will not the ladies be afeard of the lion ?
Moneys is your suit .
A joint stool .
Motley's the only wear .
Therefore beware my censure , and keep your promise .
I can not tell .
Tell them that you know that Hero loves me .
And I for Ganymede .
Oh , that's a brave man .
Tis well blown , lads .
By my knavery ( if I had it ) , then I were .
Oh , wonderful !
I bade the rascal knock upon your gate And could not get him for my heart to do it .
Still live they , and forever let them last .
What , with the case of eyes ?
What's your name ?
Honest Iago Hath ta'en order for 't .
He kills her in her own humor .
No , it is struck .
Give me your arm .
Pray ye , sir ?
It is not seen enough ; you should wear it in your cap .
The fellow has good judgment .
Tis pity of him .
By your most gracious pardon , I sing but after you .
Let each man render me his bloody hand .
Then certifies your Lordship that this night He dreamt the boar had razed his helm Besides , he says there are two councils kept , And that may be determined at the one Which may make you and him to rue at th ' other .
I would have my bond .
Still be 't yours .
Did he live now ,
This sight would make him do a desperate turn , Yea , curse his better angel from his side And fall to reprobation .
Do what you will , dishonor shall be humor .
Or came it by request and such fair question As soul to soul affordeth ?
A ring he hath of mine worth forty ducats , And for the same he promised me a chain .
Methinks our garments are now as fresh as when we put them on first in Afric , at the marriage of the king's fair daughter Claribel to the King of Tunis .
Pray you , is he married to Cleopatra ?
Captain Fluellen .
Nay , I bear it on my shoulders as a beggar wont her brat , and I think when he hath lamed me , I shall beg with it from door to door .
If it be so as so 'tis put on me , And that in way of caution , I must tell you , You do not understand yourself so clearly As it behooves my daughter and your honor .
My old friend Grumio and my good friend Petruchio ?
Thus hath the candle singed the moth .
I do , truly , for thou swear'st to me thou art honest .
Ay , and a subtle , as he most learnedly delivered .
Words before blows .
The time of universal peace is near .
Did you and he consent in Cassio's death ?
Turning th ' accomplishment of many years Into an hour-glass ; for the which supply , Admit me chorus to this history ; Who , prologue-like , your humble patience pray Gently to hear , kindly to judge our play .
You may go to the devil's dam !
Let him go up into the public chair .
My lord Sebastian , The truth you speak doth lack some gentleness And time to speak it in .
Arise , and say how thou camest here .
What will you give me now For the same handkerchief ?
Haply the seas and countries different With variable objects shall expel This something-settled matter in his heart , Whereon his brains still beating puts him thus From fashion of himself .
Let pride , which she calls plainness , marry her .
Oh !
Thou art armed , Gloucester .
And art thou living , Stephano ?
What do you mean ?
Ay .
But there is never a fair woman has a true face .
Had we fought , I doubt we should have been too young for them .
Take their examination yourself and bring it me .
I hope this reason stands for my excuse .
Of one not easily jealous , but being wrought , Perplexed in the extreme .
You can not better be employed , Bassanio , Than to live still and write mine epitaph .
Caesar hath sent , Too slow a messenger .
Her mother hath many times told me so .
And he's gone .
Your honor is most welcome .
I do not see them bleed .
You , you , ay , you !
But yet , Which , of he or Adrian , for a good wager , first begins to crow ?
Peace , Smulkin .
Why , you speak like an ancient and most quiet watchman , for I can not see how sleeping should offend .
Persever , counterfeit sad looks , Make mouths upon me when I turn my back , Wink each at other , hold the sweet jest up , This sport , well carried , shall be chronicled .
My duty can not suffer To obey in all your daughters ' hard commands .
So to them both .
Go bear it to the Centaur , where we host , And stay there , Dromio , till I come to thee .
Be not disturbed with my infirmity .
There's other business for thee .
Thou dost snore distinctly .
Let me see his face .
I cry you mercy , then , I took you for that cunning whore of Venice That married with Othello. , You , mistress , That have the office opposite to Saint Peter And keep the gate of hell !
I was forbid it .
And is 't not to be damned To let this canker of our nature come In further evil ?
Give him this money and these notes , Reynaldo .
Sir , Mark Antony Will e'en but kiss Octavia , and we'll follow .
Let grief Convert to anger .
No child but Hero ; she's his only heir .
He did appoint so .
If our father carry authority with such dispositions as he bears , this last surrender of his will but offend us .
And we'll wear out In a walled prison packs and sects of great ones That ebb and flow by the moon .
Well I know the man .
You touched my vein at first .
I have neither the scholar's melancholy , which is emulation ; nor the musician's , which is fantastical ; nor the courtier's , which is proud ; nor the soldier's , which is ambitious ; nor the lawyer's , which is politic ; nor the lady's , which is nice ; nor the lover's , which is all these , but it is a melancholy of mine own , compounded of many simples , extracted from many objects , and indeed the sundry contemplation of my travels , in which my often rumination wraps me in a most humorous sadness .
List a brief tale , And when 'tis told , oh , that my heart would burst !
I know my remedy .
Tis death for anyone in Mantua To come to Padua .
Let us go , For it is after midnight , and ere day We will awake him and be sure of him .
My husband !
If you went in pain , master , this knave would go sore .
For all the rest , They'll take suggestion as a cat laps milk .
All things shall be well .
So humbly take my leave .
Therefore my age is as a lusty winter , Frosty but kindly .
Nay , come , again .
One of these three contains her heavenly picture .
For Michael Cassio , I dare be sworn , I think , that he is honest .
I'll teach you how to flow .
Peace , peace !
So , it will make us mad .
That is some good .
See it done And feast the army .
This seen , Orlando did approach the man And found it was his brother , his elder brother .
The lieutenant is to be saved before the ancient .
Then he shall have no odds .
That they were , I wish Myself were mudded in that oozy bed Where my son lies. , When did you lose your daughter ?
Oh , are you come , Iago ?
Therefore , I beseech your Highness pardon me .
Good morrow , brother Bedford .
Tell me thine first .
By heaven , I saw my handkerchief in 's hand .
It is no hidden virtue in him .
All this done , Repair to Pompey's porch , where you shall find us .
Give him direction for this merry bond , And I will go and purse the ducats straight , See to my house left in the fearful guard Of an unthrifty knave , and presently I will be with you .
And in this habit Met I my father with his bleeding rings , Their precious stones new lost , became his guide , Led him , begged for him , saved him from despair .
I would to God all strifes were well compounded .
No ?
Tis age that nourisheth .
Marry , before your ladyship , I grant , She puts her tongue a little in her heart And chides with thinking .
Now , darting Parthia , art thou struck , and now Pleased fortune does of Marcus Crassus' death Make me revenger .
She hath prevented me .
Home , you idle creatures get you home !
I have offended reputation , A most unnoble swerving .
The French might have a good prey of us if he knew of it , for there is none to guard it but boys .
If then true lovers have been ever crossed , It stands as an edict in destiny .
Is this your speeding ?
Tarry , good Beatrice .
My lord , my lord !
If not , he's plain .
Caesar is touched .
Ha !
If in Naples I should report this now , would they believe me ?
I fear no uncles dead .
Let us , Lepidus , not lack your company .
Woo't thou fight well ?
Moonshine and Lion are left to bury the dead .
So , of his gentleness , Knowing I loved my books , he furnished me From mine own library with volumes that I prize above my dukedom .
Or I will live Or bathe my dying honor in the blood Shall make it live again .
Dost thou hear , Iago ?
Nothing in his life Became him like the leaving it .
I am glad of your departure .
The lunatic , the lover , and the poet Are of imagination all compact .
Nay , he reserved a blanket , else we had been all shamed .
I will say so .
Why are you grown so rude ?
Much good do you , scald knave , heartily .
By foul play , as thou sayst , were we heaved thence , But blessedly holp hither .
All things in common nature should produce Without sweat or endeavor .
Still am I called. , Unhand me , gentlemen .
Why , 'tis good to be sad and say nothing .
Then fly !
But fare ye well .
What is it thou didst say ?
I am changed .
Tis so strange That , though the truth of it stands off as gross As black and white , my eye will scarcely see it .
That you did fear is done .
The Prince and Monsieur Love !
A pestilent gall to me !
I do hear the morning lark .
And when was he wont to wash his face ?
I promise you your kindred hath made my eyes water ere now .
What do you mean ?
Disorder , that hath spoiled us , friend us now .
Bassanio told him he would make some speed Of his return .
O traitors , villains !
Then will two at once woo one .
Put money in thy purse .
O Isis , 'tis impossible .
O monstrous , monstrous !
We have been up and down to seek him .
We speak no treason , man .
Drunk ?
Come on , sir .
Farewell , good Signior Love .
Alack , sir , he is mad .
Count , take of me my daughter , and with her my fortunes .
But better service have I never done you Than now to bid you hold .
Enter , sir , the castle .
I hear a knocking At the south entry .
Come , gentlemen , Let us consult upon tomorrow's business Into my tent .
Is all our company here ?
Let's make us med'cines of our great revenge , To cure this deadly grief .
Yes , 'tis Emilia. , 'T is like she comes to speak of Cassio's death , The noise was high .
Caliban !
Thy grace shall have it .
My maid Nerissa and myself meantime Will live as maids and widows .
I take it your own business calls on you And you embrace th ' occasion to depart .
Here , my good lord .
Lights , lights , lights !
Neither rhyme nor reason can express how much .
Be these the wretches that we played at dice for ?
O limed soul that , struggling to be free , Art more engaged !
Why , I am sorry for thee , gentle Silvius .
All take hands .
You have been factious one against the other. , Wife , love Lord Hastings .
What need you five and twenty , ten , or five To follow in a house where twice so many Have a command to tend you ?
Behold it stained With his most noble blood .
Tis double wrong to truant with your bed And let her read it in thy looks at board .
Yet you are withered .
If she be in her chamber or your house , Let loose on me the justice of the state For thus deluding you .
Oh , be sick , great greatness , And bid thy ceremony give thee cure !
No , make it two more .
O , O , O , O .
Ay , sir , for three months .
Follow me , lady. , Turn out that eyeless villain .
In troth , I think I should , and undo 't when I had done .
Well , say , sir .
He wonders to what end you have assembled Such troops of citizens to come to him , His grace not being warned thereof before .
I hope you will consider what is spoke Comes from my love .
Your bedchamber .
If you poison us , do we not die ?
Most welcome home !
I never heard a passion so confused , So strange , outrageous , and so variable , As the dog Jew did utter in the streets .
Two of my brother's men bound !
Well , look unto it .
Without contradiction I have heard that .
Unless you could teach me to forget a banished father , you must not learn me how to remember any extraordinary pleasure .
Nay , but how dearly he adores Mark Antony !
The April's in her eyes ; it is love's spring , And these the showers to bring it on .
Go by , Saint Jeronimy .
But have I fall'n , or no ?
What should I say , sweet lady ?
My old brain is troubled .
I might have saved her .
Will it not be received , When we have marked with blood those sleepy two Of his own chamber and used their very daggers , That they have done 't ?
Tis worse than murder To do upon respect such violent outrage .
I love thee not .
What you know , you know .
Swum ashore , man , like a duck .
I will fetch up your goats , Audrey .
O mischief strangely thwarting !
Why , give it to my wife , and fetch your money .
Why dost thou use me thus ?
Then must we look from his age to receive not alone the imperfections of long-engrafted condition , but therewithal the unruly waywardness that infirm and choleric years bring with them .
And we will mend thy wages .
I will not think it .
Thyself a queen , for me that was a queen , Outlive thy glory , like my wretched self .
Shall we be sundered ?
Seal then , and all is done. , Eros ! , I come , my Queen. , Eros ! , Stay for me .
O , full of danger is the duke of Gloucester , And the queen's sons and brothers haught and proud , And were they to be ruled , and not to rule , This sickly land might solace as before .
Why do you infect yourself with them ?
No , I protest , I know not the contents .
I can , Petruchio , help thee to a wife With wealth enough , and young and beauteous , Brought up as best becomes a gentlewoman .
Yet here , Laertes ?
Sir , I shall meet your wit in the career , an you charge it against me .
And these few precepts in thy memory Look thou character .
Fie , how impatience loureth in your face .
His death's upon him , but not dead .
Alas , why would you heap this care on me ?
I have looked upon the world for four times seven years , and since I could distinguish betwixt a benefit and an injury I never found man that knew how to love himself .
I know her father , though I know not her , And he knew my deceased father well .
Go to him , Dolabella , bid him yield .
And Caesar shall go forth .
So the spirit is eased .
From this time forth I never will speak word .
I am th ' unhappy subject of these quarrels .
I perceive these lords At this encounter do so much admire That they devour their reason and scarce think Their eyes do offices of truth , their words Are natural breath. , But howsoev'r you have Been justled from your senses , know for certain That I am Prospero and that very duke Which was thrust forth of Milan , who most strangely Upon this shore where you were wracked , was landed , To be the lord on 't .
Fair and noble hostess , We are your guest tonight .
Nay , then .
My name's Macbeth .
And aroint thee , witch , aroint thee !
Did you know him ?
Wherefore ?
Methinks the wind hath spoke aloud at land , A fuller blast ne'er shook our battlements .
What lawful quest have given their verdict up Unto the frowning judge ?
Mine ache to think on 't .
Yea , yea , my lord .
Let him alone , for I remember now How he's employed .
I know no news , my lord .
Let me have surgeons .
He is a god and knows What is most right .
That's more than we know .
He loves me well , and I have given him reasons .
Hath put himself from rest , And must needs taste his folly .
Is 't true ?
Thence I have followed it , Or it hath drawn me rather .
Your reproof is something too round .
The world esteemed thy father honorable , But I did find him still mine enemy .
I could tell you more news too .
By Chrish , la , 'tish ill done .
Shall I descend ?
Yes , truly , for look you , the sins of the father are to be laid upon the children .
We , at the height , are ready to decline .
Good fortune , worthy soldier , and farewell .
Shall not be long but I'll be here again .
You the like loss ?
Nay , I have ta'en you napping , gentle love , And have forsworn you with Hortensio .
Now lies he there , And none so poor to do him reverence .
Lives he , good uncle ?
Why , I said nothing .
Touch her soft mouth , and march .
Good morrow , friends .
If you are so fond over her iniquity , give her patent to offend , for if it touch not you it comes near nobody .
I never shall endure her .
Tis his fashion .
Nothing but "low" and "little" ! , Why will you suffer her to flout me thus ?
Excellent .
What may I call your name ?
I pray you , let me see it .
Shall I hear from you anon ?
As it determines , so Dissolve my life !
Naught that I am , Not for their own demerits , but for mine , Fell slaughter on their souls .
Thou hast taken against me a most just exception , but yet I protest I have dealt most directly in thy affair .
Will you give thanks , sweet Kate , or else shall I ? , What's this ?
On such a full sea are we now afloat , And we must take the current when it serves Or lose our ventures .
Well then , take a good heart and counterfeit to be a man .
Strangle her in her bed , even the bed she hath contaminated .
Caesar ?
We have seen the best of our time .
Do so .
You see her eyes are open .
Alas for both , both mine , Edward and Clarence !
These words are not mine .
As I am an honest man , I thought you had received some bodily wound .
When a wise man gives thee better counsel , give me mine again .
And he did bid us follow to the temple .
Look who comes here .
Why , he shall never wake until the great Judgment Day .
I must be gone .
Sure ones , then .
It is good to grow .
Who could be out , being before his beloved mistress ?
What are his words ?
Lend me your hand .
I tell you what you shall do .
O , name him not .
Who did strike out the light ?
Very good , my lord .
This a dull sight .
What stay had I but Edward ?
Howl , howl , howl , howl !
I gave my love a ring and made him swear Never to part with it .
Then hear me , gracious sovereign , and you peers That owe yourselves , your lives , and services To this imperial throne .
For the poor wren , The most diminutive of birds , will fight , Her young ones in her nest , against the owl .
The moon shines bright .
Demetrius is a worthy gentleman .
This , this .
O Lord , methought what pain it was to drown , What dreadful noise of waters in my ears , What sights of ugly death within my eyes .
When Roscius was an actor in Rome , The actors are come hither , my lord .
Farewell , good Strato .
He fears , my lord , you mean no good to him .
Sweet Portia , If you did know to whom I gave the ring , If you did know for whom I gave the ring , And would conceive for what I gave the ring , And how unwillingly I left the ring When naught would be accepted but the ring , You would abate the strength of your displeasure .
What tell'st thou me of robbing ?
Be a child o' th' time .
This guest of summer , The temple-haunting martlet , does approve , By his loved mansionry , that the heaven's breath Smells wooingly here .
Tush , Gremio .
Marry them to your heirs !
I fear I wrong the honorable men Whose daggers have stabbed Caesar .
With his own bolt ; the strong-based promontory Have I made shake , and by the spurs plucked up The pine and cedar ; graves at my command Have waked their sleepers , oped , and let 'em forth By my so potent art .
Is he married ?
By mine honor , in true English , I love thee , Kate .
Thou sayst his meat was sauced with thy upbraidings .
Read it , great Caesar .
Is not the leaf turned down Where I left reading ?
Go fetch them hither .
How satisfied , my lord ?
The king mine uncle is to blame for it .
I wish you well , and so I take my leave .
Then must I think you would not have it so .
Cry the man mercy , love him , take his offer .
I am only sorry He had no other death's-man .
O , what a fall was there , my countrymen !
How goes the world , sir , now ?
Now a little fire in a wild field were like an old lecher's heart , a small spark , all the rest on 's body cold .
A dollar .
So will it fare with Claudio .
If your master Would have a queen his beggar , you must tell him , That majesty , to keep decorum , must No less beg than a kingdom .
You , mistress , all this coil is long of you .
I say my prayers aloud .
Now , by the faith of my love , I will .
Thus I mend it : Time himself is bald and therefore , to the world's end , will have bald followers .
I have seen you both .
Each new morn New widows howl , new orphans cry , new sorrows Strike heaven on the face , that it resounds As if it felt with Scotland and yelled out Like syllable of dolor .
You must play Pyramus. , And Flute , you Thisbe .
Farewell .
Farewell , hostess .
No more light answers .
Silver .
My sweet mistress Weeps when she sees me work , and says such baseness Had never like executor .
By your patience , I may not suffer you to visit them .
Words , words , words .
Set me the stoups of wine upon that table .
Upon what sickness ?
They have dispatched with Pompey ; he is gone .
And if thy poor devoted servant may But beg one favor at thy gracious hand , Thou dost confirm his happiness forever .
Though Nature hath given us wit to flout at Fortune , hath not Fortune sent in this fool to cut off the argument ?
All that I have to say is to tell you that the lanthorn is the moon ; I , the man in the moon ; this thornbush , my thornbush ; and this dog , my dog .
You use this dalliance to excuse Your breach of promise to the Porpentine .
The rest march on with me .
Retire thee , go where thou art billeted .
I know he would not be a wolf But that he sees the Romans are but sheep .
Truly , the lady fathers herself. , Be happy , lady , for you are like an honorable father .
Approach and speak .
I will not long be troubled with you .
This is some monster of the isle with four legs who hath got , as I take it , an ague .
Truly , I would the gods had made thee poetical .
Come like shadows ; so depart !
Honest , my lord ?
Do you wish then that the gods had made me poetical ?
Give me , " quoth I .
Come , go along .
Come , bustle , bustle .
What is thy name ?
It is .
There I have another bad match ! , a bankrupt , a prodigal who dare scarce show his head on the Rialto , a beggar that was used to come so smug upon the mart .
His eyes are red as fire with weeping .
With him is Gratiano gone along .
I therefore vouch again That with some mixtures powerful o'er the blood Or with some dram , conjured to this effect , He wrought upon her .
My spirits , as in a dream , are all bound up .
Here are enemies .
If your love do not persuade you to come , let not my letter." O love , dispatch all business and be gone !
O , train me not , sweet mermaid , with thy note To drown me in thy sister's flood of tears .
Where is Montjoy the herald ?
All's one .
Peace , you dull fool .
No .
And so , I pray thee , call Beatrice .
Can not a plain man live and think no harm , But thus his simple truth must be abused With silken , sly , insinuating jacks ?
I pray you .
Gentlemen , forward to the bridal dinner .
There's no composition in this news That gives them credit .
What say you , uncle ?
And so she doth , cousin .
They shout for joy .
How now , masters ?
Past the mid season .
Farewell , farewell .
Master , for my hand , Both our inventions meet and jump in one .
You look angerly .
Marvelous sweet music !
I would they'd fight i' th' fire or i' th' air , We'd fight there too .
Discuss unto me : art thou officer or art thou base , common , and popular ?
Of what , lady ?
Upon the crown o ' th ' cliff , what thing was that Which parted from you ?
Now sir , this granted , as it is a most pregnant and unforced position , who stands so eminent in the degree of this fortune as Cassio does ?
It is his .
Make the doors upon a woman's wit , and it will out at the casement .
Ay , madam .
Trouble yourselves no further .
We'll send Mark Antony to the senate house , And he shall say you are not well today .
You know that I held Epicurus strong And his opinion .
Would he deny his letter , said he ?
You or any man living may be drunk at a time , man .
Take my sword .
They are wise and honorable , And will , no doubt , with reasons answer you .
Give me another horse !
Fetch that gallant hither .
I pray thee , hear me speak .
If I owe you anything , I will pay you in cudgels .
Think'st thou that duty shall have dread to speak When power to flattery bows ?
I think withal There would be hands uplifted in my right ; And here from gracious England have I offer Of goodly thousands .
Why looks your grace so heavily today ?
Stop in your wind , sir .
Tis neither here nor there .
O , farewell , honest soldier .
O happy horse , to bear the weight of Antony !
Come , sister. , Shepherdess , look on him better , And be not proud .
You saw my master wink and laugh upon you ?
It were , my lord , a hard condition for a maid to consign to .
I will hold friends with you , lady .
I will not swear these are my hands .
Do I entice you ?
They shall have none , I swear , but these my joints , Which , if they have , as I will leave 'em them , Shall yield them little .
Go then , find me a meet hour to draw Don Pedro and the Count Claudio alone .
Stay , countrymen .
Would that alone o ' love he would detain , So he would keep fair quarter with his bed .
How is 't with you , my most fair Bianca ?
The first that there did greet my stranger-soul Was my great father-in-law , renowned Warwick , Who spake aloud , "What scourge for perjury Can this dark monarchy afford false Clarence ? " And so he vanished .
Come , wherefore should you be so pashful ?
I have 't .
Therefore this project
Remember what I have said .
Come , prepare .
Oh , defend me !
What , not a whore ?
This my mean task Would be as heavy to me as odious , but The mistress which I serve quickens what's dead And makes my labors pleasures .
Therefore , you clown , abandon , which is , in the vulgar , "leave" , the society , which in the boorish is "company" , of this female , which in the common is "woman" ; which together is , abandon the society of this female , or , clown , thou perishest ; or , to thy better understanding , diest ; or , to wit , I kill thee , make thee away , translate thy life into death , thy liberty into bondage .
Your worship was wont to tell me that I could do nothing without bidding .
An evil soul producing holy witness Is like a villain with a smiling cheek , A goodly apple rotten at the heart .
But if these , As I am sure they do , bear fire enough To kindle cowards and to steel with valor The melting spirits of women , then , countrymen , What need we any spur but our own cause To prick us to redress ?
What mean your graces ?
Go with me To bless this twain that they may prosperous be , And honored in their issue .
I am boy to them all three , but all they three , though they would serve me , could not be man to me .
Your husband being troubled with a shrew Measures my husband's sorrow by his woe .
Come , Casca , you and I will yet ere day See Brutus at his house .
A good moral , my lord : it is not enough to speak , but to speak true .
Shall I know your answer ?
You thought because he could not speak English in the native garb , he could not therefore handle an English cudgel .
He can not be such a monster , Nor is not , sure .
Some bloody passion shakes your very frame .
Twere good you let him know , For who that's but a queen , fair , sober , wise , Would from a paddock , from a bat , a gib , Such dear concernings hide ?
I am an ass , I am a woman's man , and besides myself .
Give me your hand .
His word might bear my wealth at any time .
Speak within door .
Say on , my loving lord .
Now Antony must leave her utterly .
Good or bad news , that thou com'st in so bluntly ?
The trumpery in my house , go bring it hither For stale to catch these thieves .
Didst perceive ?
Master , knock the door hard .
I can not fly , But , bearlike , I must fight the course .
Look upon Caesar .
In food , in sport , and life-preserving rest To be disturbed , would mad or man or beast .
Hark !
Fetch the will hither , and we shall determine How to cut off some charge in legacies .
The west yet glimmers with some streaks of day .
What means that bloody knife ?
Whilst you were here o'erwhelmed with your grief , A passion most resulting such a man , Cassio came hither .
O , let me think on Hastings and be gone To Brecknock , while my fearful head is on !
We'll know all our fortunes .
For two , and sound ones too .
If I live to see it , I will never trust his word after .
Good morrow to your Worship .
Is there none here to give the woman ?
Her hedges , even-pleached , Like prisoners wildly overgrown with hair , Put forth disordered twigs .
I shall obey , my lord .
Two of both kinds make up four .
O , do not swear , my lord of Buckingham !
You speak too bitterly .
Shylock , there's thrice thy money offered thee .
Desist , and drink .
My royal cousin , teach you our princess English ?
Bid him bring his pen and inkhorn to the jail .
My stomach is not constant .
Hath he asked for me ?
Very well mended .
Only to despite them , I will endeavor anything .
I long To hear the story of your life , which must Take the ear strangely .
Go make thyself like a nymph o ' th ' sea .
Tell the hot duke that Lear , No , but not yet .
On what occasion God He knows , not I , The queen your mother and your brother York Have taken sanctuary .
Or did the letters work upon his blood And new-create his fault ?
Thou an Egyptian puppet shalt be shown In Rome , as well as I .
The folly of this island .
O hard condition , Twin-born with greatness , subject to the breath Of every fool , whose sense no more can feel But his own wringing .
Her eyes are fierce , but thine Do comfort and not burn .
Normans , but bastard Normans , Norman bastards !
Richard except , those whom we fight against Had rather have us win than him they follow .
See where he looks out of the window .
Of us must Pompey presently be sought , Or else he seeks out us .
My master will be here ere morning .
You could , for a need , study a speech of some dozen or sixteen lines which I would set down and insert in 't , could you not ?
As I suck blood , I will some mercy show .
Then to have seen much and to have nothing is to have rich eyes and poor hands .
And the best of me is diligence .
You see an ass head of your own , do you ?
What ring gave you my lord ?
For I am sure , Though you can guess what temperance should be , You know not what it is .
Sweet men , come to him .
Twas a color he never liked .
Thus far can I praise him : he is of a noble strain , of approved valor , and confirmed honesty .
Tis a fault I will not change for your best virtue .
Look where he comes .
Prepare you , generals .
Out of my sight !
Read it instantly .
The will , the will !
Captain Macmorris , when there is more better opportunity to be required , look you , I will be so bold as to tell you I know the disciplines of war , and there is an end .
Where's the Queen ?
My noble father , I do perceive here a divided duty .
O , what men dare do !
Though the wisdom of nature can reason it thus and thus , yet nature finds itself scourged by the sequent effects .
Oh well done !
Last night of all , When yond same star that's westward from the pole Had made his course t ' illume that part of heaven Where now it burns , Marcellus and myself , The bell then beating one , Peace , break thee off .
We would so , and then go a-batfowling .
He has killed me , mother .
She will not .
O perjured woman !
You will compel me , then , to read the will ?
I would not deny you , but , by this good day , I yield upon great persuasion , and partly to save your life , for I was told you were in a consumption .
And there were drawn Upon a heap a hundred ghastly women , Transformed with their fear , who swore they saw Men all in fire walk up and down the streets .
I think thou art in mind , and so am I. Nay , master , both in mind and in my shape .
If there were no more women but Fulvia , then had you indeed a cut , and the case to be lamented .
Why ask you this ?
Were we before our armies , and to fight , I should do thus .
Believe me , sir , they butt together well .
I never saw an action of such shame .
It is a branch and parcel of mine oath , A charitable duty of my order .
Well , let that rest .
An please your Majesty , let his neck answer for it , if there is any martial law in the world .
Let's hear it .
My dearest coz , I pray you school yourself .
What's the matter ?
A sister I bequeath you whom no brother Did ever love so dearly .
Men that hazard all Do it in hope of fair advantages .
What said he when he came unto himself ?
You did know How much you were my conqueror , and that My sword , made weak by my affection , would Obey it on all cause .
I will run .
Edward's unhappy sons do bid thee flourish .
What do you mean , my lord ?
Woe that too late repents ! , Is it your will ?
I think we are too bold upon your rest .
The manner of their deaths ?
Leave him to my displeasure. , Edmund , keep you our sister company .
And he that will not follow Bourbon now , Let him go hence , and with his cap in hand Like a base pander hold the chamber door , Whilst by a slave , no gentler than my dog , His fairest daughter is contaminate .
I have fair meanings , sir .
Hark .
I do desire we may be better strangers .
No more than from my soul I mourn for yours .
I will tell you why .
Emilia , run you to the citadel And tell my lord and lady what hath happed. , Will you go on afore ?
Nay , by 'r Lady , that I think he can not .
I shall do my friends no wrong , for I have none to lament me ; the world no injury , for in it I have nothing .
I am constant to my purpose .
This jest shall cost me some expense .
Ay , sir .
Noses , ears , and lips .
I pray you , husband , be not so disquiet .
The great contention of the sea and skies Parted our fellowship , But , hark !
And so the lion vanished .
Not for all this land Would I be guilty of so deep a sin .
How hath your lordship brooked imprisonment ?
I will weep .
Be thou my witness that against my will , As Pompey was , am I compelled to set Upon one battle all our liberties .
Sir , by your patience : if I heard you rightly , The duke hath put on a religious life And thrown into neglect the pompous court .
Lies all within. , Deliver me the key .
They did , Fluellen .
Follow , and see there be no harm between them .
Or if thou hast uphoarded in thy life Extorted treasure in the womb of earth , For which , they say , you spirits oft walk in death , Speak of it .
Do you know me , sir ?
I say she never did invent this letter .
Fare thee well , dame .
Me , a groat ?
I am he that is so love-shaked .
If it be found so , some will dear abide it .
So the poor third is up , till death enlarge his confine .
There is a man haunts the forest that abuses our young plants with carving "Rosalind" on their barks , hangs odes upon hawthorns and elegies on brambles , all , forsooth , deifying the name of Rosalind .
Heaven me such uses send , Not to pick bad from bad , but by bad mend !
Your brother is but young and tender , and , for your love I would be loath to foil him , as I must for my own honor if he come in .
How idly do they talk !
Come on .
Pray , chuck , come hither .
The contents , as in part I understand them , are to blame .
Well , keep me company but two years more , Thou shalt not know the sound of thine own tongue .
The dram of evil Doth all the noble substance of a doubt To his own scandal .
You mar our labor .
We would have all such offenders so cut off , and we give express charge that in our marches through the country there be nothing compelled from the villages , nothing taken but paid for , none of the French upbraided or abused in disdainful language ; for when lenity and cruelty play for a kingdom , the gentler gamester is the soonest winner .
I thank thee , good Sir John , with all my heart .
Hail , mortal .
He uses his folly like a stalking-horse , and under the presentation of that he shoots his wit .
I have myself resolved upon a course Which has no need of you .
I must be cruel only to be kind .
What , man ?
The air Nimbly and sweetly recommends itself Unto our gentle senses .
Or be alive again , And dare me to the desert with thy sword .
Lysander , keep thy Hermia .
Lay them in gore , Since you have shore With shears his thread of silk .
You can do better yet , but this is meetly .
At every house I'll call .
The storm is up and all is on the hazard .
I cry you mercy .
Tis she must do 't , And , lo , the happiness !
Therefore give out you are of Epidamnum , Lest that your goods too soon be confiscate .
There is no harm intended to your person , Nor to no Roman else .
But one fiend at a time , I'll fight their legions o'er .
Thou hast killed my child .
Who heard me to deny it or forswear it ?
In your own kingdom , sir .
Is it a man ?
I swear , By nothing , for this is no oath .
My arm is sore .
He was wont to lend money for a Christian courtesy ; let him look to his bond .
Here's one comes in his shirt , with light and weapons .
A most high miracle !
Ah , my tender babes , My unblown flowers , new-appearing sweets , If yet your gentle souls fly in the air And be not fixed in doom perpetual , Hover about me with your airy wings And hear your mother's lamentation .
The crows and choughs that wing the midway air Show scarce so gross as beetles .
The moon is down .
Othello , leave some officer behind And he shall our commission bring to you , And such things else of quality and respect As doth import you .
It may be his enemy is a gentleman of great sort , quite from the answer of his degree .
And I am such a tender ass , if my hair do but tickle me , I must scratch .
Well , old man , I will tell you news of your son .
If you should die before him , where's her dower ?
No Thisbe do I see .
Zounds , who is there ?
I come to thee for charitable license , That we may wander o'er this bloody field To book our dead and then to bury them ; To sort our nobles from our common men , For many of our princes , woe the while ! , Lie drowned and soaked in mercenary blood .
Belike they had some notice of the people How I had moved them .
Ay , if the fool could find it where it lies .
Am I your bird ?
I understand not what you mean by this .
Things must be as they may .
A good old commander and a most kind gentleman .
So get you hence in peace .
Signior ?
Dost thou understand me , man ?
Then let your will attend on their accords .
That I'll try .
They thus directed , we will follow In the main battle , whose puissance on either side Shall be well winged with our chiefest horse .
But all the story of the night told over , And all their minds transfigured so together , More witnesseth than fancy's images And grows to something of great constancy , But , howsoever , strange and admirable .
Now by my life , Old fools are babes again and must be used With checks as flatteries , when they are seen abused .
How now , Roderigo !
What , man , courage yet !
What says the golden chest ?
I have it ready for thee .
Who comes here ?
Let heaven and men and devils , let them all , All , all cry shame against me , yet I'll speak .
Hail to thee , lady , and the grace of heaven , Before , behind thee , and on every hand , Enwheel thee round !
Peace be with Burgundy .
There is no power in Venice Can alter a decree established .
True hope is swift , and flies with swallow's wings .
Ay , if I be alive and your mind hold and your dinner worth the eating .
Up , princes , and , with spirit of honor edged More sharper than your swords , hie to the field : Charles Delabreth , High Constable of France ; You dukes of Orleans , Bourbon , and of Berri , Alencon , Brabant , Bar , and Burgundy ; Jacques Chatillon , Rambures , Vaudemont , Beaumont , Grandpre , Roussi , and Faulconbridge , Foix , Lestrale , Bouciqualt , and Charolois ; High dukes , great princes , barons , lords , and knights , For your great seats now quit you of great shames .
Come , come , no longer will I be a fool , To put the finger in the eye and weep Whilst man and master laugh my woes to scorn .
Music , hark .
Canidius , Our nineteen legions thou shalt hold by land , And our twelve thousand horse .
Fie on thee !
O , rejoice Beyond a common joy , and set it down With gold on lasting pillars .
Carried to Colmekill , The sacred storehouse of his predecessors , And guardian of their bones .
Thus die I , thus , thus , thus .
A plague upon the tyrant that I serve !
Where's Antony ?
Lady Beatrice , have you wept all this while ?
If you will patiently dance in our round And see our moonlight revels , go with us .
O'er my spirit Thy full supremacy thou knew'st , and that Thy beck might from the bidding of the gods Command me .
My wife is coming yonder .
Heavens shield Lysander if they mean a fray !
Now all the blessings Of a glad father , compass thee about .
Let her have your voice .
Prithee say true !
But I will tarry .
Farewell to you. , And you. , And you , Volumnius .
And , I think , if my breast had not been made of faith , and my heart of steel , She had transformed me to a curtal dog and made me turn i ' th ' wheel .
Canst thou blame him ?
If she do bid me pack , I'll give her thanks , As though she bid me stay by her a week .
I thought so then , I'll kill myself for grief .
Art thou thus boldened , man , by thy distress Or else a rude despiser of good manners , That in civility thou seem'st so empty ?
Now , most noble Brutus , The gods today stand friendly that we may , Lovers in peace , lead on our days to age .
Heavenly powers , restore him !
A friend ?
Are not you he ?
There's but one down .
No , pray thee , let it serve for table talk .
But on thy side I may not be too forward , Lest , being seen , thy brother , tender George , Be executed in his father's sight .
I have spoke thus much To mitigate the justice of thy plea , Which if thou follow , this strict court of Venice Must needs give sentence 'gainst the merchant there .
I had it of Leah when I was a bachelor .
Who is that calls so coldly ?
Where have you this ?
Vex not his ghost .
This is most certain that I shall deliver : Mark Antony is every hour in Rome Expected .
Where may we set our horses ?
I partly know the man .
I go , I go .
My mistress and her sister stays for you .
You are a counterfeit cowardly knave .
How now , my friend , why dost thou look so pale ?
But wherefore could not I pronounce "Amen" ?
You shall not seal to such a bond for me !
The games are done and Caesar is returning .
Is all things ready for the royal time ?
Kneel to the duke before he pass the abbey .
But soft you , let me be .
Signior , it is the Moor .
It was my duty , sir .
Well , I would you did like me .
Lady , amen .
If they'll do neither , we will come to them And make them skirr away as swift as stones Enforced from the old Assyrian slings .
Since my dear soul was mistress of her choice And could of men distinguish , her election Hath sealed thee for herself , for thou hast been , As one in suffering all that suffers nothing , A man that Fortune's buffets and rewards Hast ta'en with equal thanks .
This I'll report , dear lady .
If I did take the kingdom from your sons , To make amends I'll give it to your daughter .
What shall I know of thee ?
Here .
You all do know this mantle .
Ay , if your self's remembrance wrong yourself .
Ha , ha , ha !
Ay , madam , but returns again tonight .
Come , I'll go in with you .
I stand here for law .
Speak , Pyramus. , Thisbe , stand forth .
Henceforth I'll bear Affliction till it do cry out itself , "Enough , enough , " and die .
All ready .
If it were now to die , 'Twere now to be most happy , for I fear My soul hath her content so absolute That not another comfort like to this Succeeds in unknown fate .
I will proclaim my name about the field .
Come , come , wrestle with thy affections .
By heaven , I charge thee , speak .
Well , may you see things well done there .
I'll to my charge .
I think thou art an ass .
My brother and thy uncle , called Antonio , I pray thee , mark me ( that a brother should Be so perfidious !
Come apace , good Audrey .
Take comfort .
Alas !
But for a fine , quaint , graceful , and excellent fashion , yours is worth ten on 't .
Yes , I intend so .
Let's to billiards .
They vanished strangely .
But this good comfort bring I to your Highness : The Breton navy is dispersed by tempest .
I am not Cinna the conspirator .
Well , you temporize with the hours .
Yea , my good lord .
She hath good leave .
Let it come down .
Tis he that sends us to destroy you here .
I have done the deed .
I'll bring my wood home faster .
I am bound by oath , and therefore pardon me .
Lo , here I lie , Never to rise again .
Oh , a cherubim Thou wast that did preserve me .
What committed ?
Where are they ?
Send to his brother .
Your grace hath laid the odds o ' th ' weaker side .
Please 't your highness To grace us with your royal company ?
Swords out , and tilting one at other's breasts In opposition bloody .
Did he confess it ?
Never at quiet .
Go get him surgeons .
The beds i' th' East are soft , and thanks to you , That called me timelier than my purpose hither , For I have gained by 't .
O Clitus !
The weary way hath made you melancholy .
I almost die for food , and let me have it .
Lady , were you her bedfellow last night ?
Thou dost mean something .
Speak .
Macbeth shall never vanquished be until Great Birnam Wood to high Dunsinane Hill Shall come against him .
Fie , fie on all tired jades , on all mad masters , and all foul ways !
That's he that was Othello .
Thou shalt get kings , though thou be none .
Is she as tall as me ?
We'll revenge his death .
And I for Rosalind .
It faded on the crowing of the cock .
I know not why he comes .
We never valued this poor seat of England And therefore , living hence , did give ourself To barbarous license , as 'tis ever common That men are merriest when they are from home .
Dead .
I had a wound here that was like a "T , " But now 'tis made an "H." They do retire .
Dear sovereign , hear me speak .
Here comes the good Macduff .
And for three months .
He is slain .
Yea , wherefore should she not ?
I swear 'tis better to be much abused Than but to know 't a little .
The ladies , her attendants of her chamber Saw her abed , and in the morning early They found the bed untreasured of their mistress .
Proceed .
Will you walk in to see their gossiping ?
Let me endure your wrath , if 't be not so .
Fetch forth the stocks !
Sir , sir , I will have law in Ephesus , To your notorious shame , I doubt it not .
Expose thyself to feel what wretches feel , That thou mayst shake the superflux to them And show the heavens more just .
Here's a change indeed !
His ceremonies laid by , in his nakedness he appears but a man , and though his affections are higher mounted than ours , yet when they stoop , they stoop with the like wing .
Fie , fie !
Hear me , good madam .
Ay , very well , my lord .
I know thee , Roderigo .
Why , then , some be of laughing , as , ah , ha , he !
I will not choose what many men desire Because I will not jump with common spirits And rank me with the barbarous multitudes .
But , first or last , Your fine Egyptian cookery shall have The fame .
I have a thing for you .
Ay , my lord .
Why do you send so thick ?
As they pass by , pluck Casca by the sleeve , And he will , after his sour fashion , tell you What hath proceeded worthy note today .
Lord , what fools these mortals be !
Why , anything .
Oh , out of that "no hope" What great hope have you !
Shame itself !
I know that voice .
Believe me , I had rather have lost my purse Full of crusadoes .
A man no mightier than thyself or me In personal action , yet prodigious grown , And fearful as these strange eruptions are .
That light we see is burning in my hall .
Poor Tom hath been scared out of his good wits .
Here , sir ! " You loggerheaded and unpolished grooms !
I may sit in a corner and cry , "Heigh-ho for a husband ! " Lady Beatrice , I will get you one .
They're busy within .
When comes such another ?
I hear it by the way ; but I will send .
Why , so .
Hark thee , Dardanius .
All dead .
God and our innocence defend and guard us !
To punish me for what you make me do Seems much unequal .
But I have heard him oft maintain it to be fit that , sons at perfect age and fathers declined , the father should be as ward to the son , and the son manage his revenue .
That will never be .
Tis a wonder , by your leave , she will be tamed so .
Neighbors and friends , though bride and bridegroom wants For to supply the places at the table , You know there wants no junkets at the feast .
The children live whose fathers thou hast slaughtered , Ungoverned youth , to wail it in their age ; The parents live whose children thou hast butchered , Old barren plants , to wail it with their age .
You have made me offer Of Sicily , Sardinia .
I'll have them sleep on cushions in my tent .
I dreamt tonight that I did feast with Caesar , And things unlucky charge my fantasy .
Your Grace , we think , should soonest know his mind .
Good night , my lord .
Why , he is the Prince's jester , a very dull fool , only his gift is in devising impossible slanders .
Love me or love me not , I like the cap , And it I will have , or I will have none .
Casca , you are the first that rears your hand .
But I confess , sir , that we were locked out .
It is my fashion , when I see a crab .
You tremble and look pale .
Here it is , I think .
Why doth the Jew pause ?
With all my heart I'll gossip at this feast .
I am glad thy father's dead , Thy match was mortal to him , and pure grief Shore his old thread in twain .
Prescribe not us our duty .
Barren my wit ?
You are rather point-device in your accouterments , as loving yourself than seeming the lover of any other .
A victory is twice itself when the achiever brings home full numbers .
Can I bear that with patience , And not my husband's secrets ?
I am bound to hear .
Stand !
They are coming to the play .
Thus answer I in the name of Benedick , But hear these ill news with the ears of Claudio .
Good signors both , when shall we laugh ?
I had rather be married to a death's-head with a bone in his mouth than to either of these .
I charge thee , tempt me not .
Let me go with him .
How the moon sleeps with Endymion And would not be awaked .
Well , thou dost best .
The forfeit , sovereign , of my servant's life , Who slew today a riotous gentleman Lately attendant on the duke of Norfolk .
In happy time here comes the duke himself .
May you stead me ?
Thou art a boil , A plague-sore or embossed carbuncle In my corrupted blood .
Bid them all fly .
That was in thy rage .
But what's the matter , Clarence ?
Sir , his definement suffers no perdition in you , though I know to divide him inventorially would dizzy th ' arithmetic of memory , and yet but yaw neither , in respect of his quick sail .
So young and so untender ?
Look to the lady .
But I have cause to pry into this pedant .
None but the fool , who labors to outjest His heart-struck injuries .
Ay , and the time seems thirty unto me , Being all this time abandoned from your bed .
Is his head worth a hat or his chin worth a beard ?
What is "t o"clock ?
Good night , good brother .
Oh , 'tis a gallant king !
Let me comply with you in this garb , lest my extent to the players , which , I tell you , must show fairly outwards , should more appear like entertainment than yours .
Who is 't that can inform me ?
I never spake with her in all my life .
Take what wife you will to bed , I will ever be your head .
It is impossible you should see this , Were they as prime as goats , as hot as monkeys , As salt as wolves in pride , and fools as gross As ignorance made drunk .
Prithee , dispatch .
It is a creature That dotes on Cassio , as 'tis the strumpet's plague To beguile many and be beguiled by one .
He's coming , madam .
But shall we wear these glories for a day , Or shall they last and we rejoice in them ?
Sweetly in force unto her fair life's end .
I will not disclose 'em .
And a chain , that you once wore , about his neck .
If she confess that she was half the wooer , Destruction on my head if my bad blame Light on the man. , Come hither , gentle mistress .
I do not know One of my sex , no woman's face remember , Save , from my glass , mine own .
How ?
I never thought him worse .
For every minute is expectancy Of more arrivance .
But say , my lord , it were not registered , Methinks the truth should live from age to age , As 'twere retailed to all posterity , Even to the general all-ending day .
Hail , brave friend !
I am the son of Marcus Cato , ho !
I doubt some foul play .
Bear him away .
Then swore he that he was a stranger here .
Why , man ?
You shall do marvelous wisely , good Reynaldo , Before you visit him , to make inquire Of his behavior .
Our fraughtage , sir , I have conveyed aboard , and I have bought The oil , the balsamum and aqua vitae .
As good cause as one would desire .
My cousin Westmoreland ?
There came divers of Antonio's creditors in my company to Venice that swear he can not choose but break .
And yet she'll kneel and pray , I have seen her do 't .
No more , I pray you .
I charge thee do so , as thou art my child .
Oh , my dear Cassio !
Bring it to that , The gold I give thee will I melt and pour Down thy ill-uttering throat .
I am no traitor .
And jealous Oberon would have the child Knight of his train , to trace the forests wild .
I will do 't , my lord .
Not a hair perished .
Alack , I love myself .
Call them forth .
Cancel his bond of life , dear God I pray , That I may live to say , "The dog is dead."
Farewell , for I must leave you .
Beshrew him for 't !
Why , Rosalind !
Her vine , the merry cheerer of the heart , Unpruned , dies .
What's he ?
Get you to bed again .
It is "never tire." Oh .
You are not wood , you are not stones , but men .
How , my lord , I may be censured , that nature thus gives way to loyalty , something fears me to think of .
Where shall we meet i ' th ' morning ?
No .
What , will my daughter prove a good musician ?
Why , there's more gold .
Where is he ?
Or have we eaten on the insane root That takes the reason prisoner ?
And you , fair sister .
If I can fasten but one cup upon him , With that which he hath drunk tonight already , He'll be as full of quarrel and offense As my young mistress ' dog .
I will to Egypt .
My lord , Mark Antony , Hearing that you prepared for war , acquainted My grieved ear withal , whereon I begged His pardon for return .
Thy daemon , that thy spirit which keeps thee , is Noble , courageous , high , unmatchable Where Caesar's is not .
Look , when I vow , I weep .
Here comes the Prince and Claudio .
As strange as the thing I know not .
Oh , what a rogue and peasant slave am I !
This approves her letter That she would soon be here .
Caesar , thou art revenged , Even with the sword that killed thee .
You shall hear more by midnight .
My liege and madam , to expostulate What majesty should be , what duty is , Why day is day , night night , and time is time , Were nothing but to waste night , day , and time .
Take you assurance of her cum privilegio ad imprimendum solum .
The gods confound thee !
Not a word .
I can stay with Regan , I and my hundred knights .
Sir , they are spoken , and these things are true .
And I serve the fairy queen To dew her orbs upon the green .
My tables ! , Meet it is I set it down That one may smile , and smile , and be a villain .
I thank thee , Ariel .
We must be patient , but I can not choose but weep , to think they should lay him i ' th ' cold ground .
Well .
There would this monster make a man .
Truly , she makes a very good report o' th' worm .
You think none but your sheets are privy to your wishes .
Go to , mum , you are he .
Away , go away !
Marry , God defend his grace should say us nay !
That is my rest ; that is the rendezvous of it .
Armed , my lord .
It were a better death than die with mocks , Which is as bad as die with tickling .
For the Queen , I'll take her to my guard .
As young as I am , I have observed these three swashers .
If you thrive well , bring them to Baynard's Castle , Where you shall find me well accompanied With reverend fathers and well-learned bishops .
Shut that , and 'twill out at the keyhole .
What needs this iterance , woman ?
One word , sir .
Where is he ?
Give us kind keepers , heavens !
I pray you call them in .
Tis sport to maul a runner .
Pluck them asunder .
If she will return me my jewels I will give over my suit and repent my unlawful solicitation .
She said so .
And know it now : the senate have concluded To give this day a crown to mighty Caesar .
What wouldst thou , fellow ?
Not sad , my lord .
Ay , madam , twenty several messengers .
Tis not in the bond .
Lady , will you walk a bout with your friend ?
Cheerly , good Adam .
And so we will , provided that he win her .
How long hath this possession held the man ?
Tell me , and dally not : where is the money ?
You may as well say , that's a valiant flea that dare eat his breakfast on the lip of a lion .
To Caesar will I render My legions and my horse .
And now I have the boy , I will undo This hateful imperfection of her eyes .
But what though ?
Ay , so please your Majesty .

But if you be remembered , I did not bid you mar it to the time .
Master , shall I be porter at the gate ?
No doubt the murd'rous knife was dull and blunt Till it was whetted on thy stone-hard heart , To revel in the entrails of my lambs .
My lord , I did , But answer made it none .
This blows my heart .
O , then it moved her ?
I told him what I thought , and told no more Than what he found himself was apt and true .
Tis not fit thus to obey him .
What you have charged me with , that have I done , And more , much more .
Will you think so ?
O Lorenzo , If thou keep promise , I shall end this strife , Become a Christian and thy loving wife .
Even as a flatt'ring dream or worthless fancy .
Ay , noble lord .
But first I will release the fairy queen .
Despair , and die !

Stand aside .
Ratcliffe , come hither .
Oh , that that earth , which kept the world in awe , Should patch a wall t ' expel the winter's flaw !
For heaven's sake , help me !
We will .
Why , man , I saw Bassanio under sail .
What watchful cares do interpose themselves Betwixt your eyes and night ?
How can it be ?

I see him rouse himself To praise my noble act .
A messenger from Caesar .

The law hath yet another hold on you .
Signior Brabantio , ho !
Harp not on that string , madam ; that is past .

And another storm brewing , I hear it sing i ' th ' wind .
So shall I clothe me in a forced content , And shut myself up in some other course , To fortune's alms .

No , no , forsooth , I dare not for my life .
Sing it .
Treason has done his worst ; nor steel nor poison , Malice domestic , foreign levy , nothing Can touch him further .
He , for his father's sake , so loves the prince That he will not be won to aught against him .

I am glad to see you in this merry vein .
Mistress , your father prays you leave your books And help to dress your sister's chamber up .
And mine a hundred and forty .

For I am sick when I do look on thee .
Light , I say , light !

Calphurnia !
A good soft pillow for that good white head Were better than a churlish turf of France .
She is spherical , like a globe .
So that in these ten thousand they have lost , There are but sixteen hundred mercenaries .
All of us have cause To wail the dimming of our shining star , But none can help our harms by wailing them. , Madam , my mother , I do cry you mercy ; I did not see your Grace .
Where is your sister , and Hortensio's wife ?
Beseech you , father .
That is the sum of all , Leonato. , Signior Claudio and Signior Benedick , my dear friend Leonato hath invited you all .
By my hand I swear , and my father's soul , the work ish ill done .
I say amen , Gonzalo .
Why , what effects of passion shows she ?
Thus must I from the smoke into the smother , From tyrant duke unto a tyrant brother .
Farewell content !
The duke of Gloucester , to whom the order of the siege is given , is altogether directed by an Irishman , a very valiant gentleman , i ' faith .
I will none .
How may that be ?
No doubt , no doubt .
Consent to pay thee that I never had ? , Arrest me , foolish fellow , if thou dar'st .
No more with me .
Shall I say to you , "Let them be free !
I know the hand .
Whiles we stood here securing your repose , Even now , we heard a hollow burst of bellowing Like bulls , or rather lions .
Oh , that we now had here But one ten thousand of those men in England That do no work today .
Unmerciful lady as you are , I'm none .
In this , though I can not be said to be a flattering honest man , it must not be denied but I am a plain-dealing villain .
Now , then , we'll use His countenance for the battle , which being done , Let her who would be rid of him devise His speedy taking off .
I pray you tell me your remedy .
I know his eye doth homage otherwhere , Or else what lets it but he would be here ?
O , lady , lady , shame would have it hid .
Beauty provoketh thieves sooner than gold .
My life , sir !
I will discharge it in either your straw-color beard , your orange-tawny beard , your purple-in-grain beard , or your French crown-color beard , your perfect yellow .
Bettering thy loss makes the bad causer worse .
He prays you to save his life .
If it will please Caesar To be so good to Caesar as to hear me , I shall beseech him to befriend himself .
A thousand thousand !
Set him before me .
So foolish sorrows bids your stones farewell .
Let him approach .
Den it sall also content me .
You shall not go .
This must crave , An if this be at all , a most strange story .
Oh , quick , or I am gone .
I think the duke will not be spoke withal .
How now ?
Is it so nominated in the bond ?
Tomorrow , if you please to speak with me , I will come home to you .
Some good man bear him carefully from hence .
Ay , for the state , not for Antonio .
We'll along ourselves , and meet them at Philippi .
I say you are not .
When time shall serve , let but the herald cry , And I'll appear again .
For do but stand upon the foaming shore , The chidden billow seems to pelt the clouds , The wind-shaked surge , with high and monstrous mane , Seems to cast water on the burning bear , And quench the guards of th ' ever-fixed pole .
I'll talk with this good fellow .
What noise is that ?
Warm , o ' my troth .
Though now this grained face of mine be hid In sap-consuming winter's drizzled snow , And all the conduits of my blood froze up , Yet hath my night of life some memory , My wasting lamps some fading glimmer left , My dull deaf ears a little use to hear .
I dare abide no longer .
I would I had been there .
I'll fetch my sister to get her goodwill .
I had been happy if the general camp , Pioneers and all , had tasted her sweet body , So I had nothing known .
Nothing could have subdued nature To such a lowness but his unkind daughters .
O sir , you are old .
Who does he accuse ?
Some that will evermore peep through their eyes And laugh like parrots at a bagpiper , And other of such vinegar aspect That they'll not show their teeth in way of smile Though Nestor swear the jest be laughable .
Here they'll be , man .
Down on your knees And thank heaven , fasting , for a good man's love , For I must tell you friendly in your ear , Sell when you can ; you are not for all markets .
How ?
God keep your Ladyship still in that mind , so some gentle- man or other shall 'scape a predestinate scratched face .
Doubtful it stood , As two spent swimmers that do cling together And choke their art .
I am in your debt for your last exercise .
Master , you looked so longly on the maid , Perhaps you marked not what's the pith of all .
Ay , madam .
An they will take it , so .
Who calls ?
Your son and daughter found this trespass worth The shame which here it suffers .
If your leisure served , I would speak with you .
I was the more deceived .
My door is lock'd .
Tell me .
I saw him not .
Which of these is he ?
For , look you , how cheerfully my mother looks , and my father died within these two hours .
Avaunt , you cullions !
Let us to the field .
You would all this time have proved there is no time for all things .
It is a massy wheel Fixed on the summit of the highest mount , To whose huge spokes ten thousand lesser things Are mortised and adjoined , which , when it falls , Each small annexment , petty consequence , Attends the boisterous ruin .
And how you may be converted I know not , but methinks you look with your eyes as other women do .
These are counselors That feelingly persuade me what I am." Sweet are the uses of adversity , Which , like the toad , ugly and venomous , Wears yet a precious jewel in his head .
For half thy wealth , it is Antonio's .
Why prat'st thou to thyself and answer'st not ?
I told you , sir , they were red-hot with drinking , So full of valor that they smote the air For breathing in their faces , beat the ground For kissing of their feet , yet always bending Towards their project .
Your goods that lay at host , sir , in the Centaur .
It was great ignorance , Gloucester's eyes being out , To let him live .
If not to answer , you might haply think Tongue-tied ambition , not replying , yielded To bear the golden yoke of sovereignty , Which fondly you would here impose on me .
When have I injured thee ?
Teach me .
Is it possible ?
Thy master and his man are here , And that is false thou dost report to us .
Good morrow , masters .
What news ?
Come , sisters , cheer we up his sprites , And show the best of our delights .
Search every acre in the high-grown field , And bring him to our eye .
Be 't so .
If you will take a homely man's advice , Be not found here .
Thy business ?
How dost thou and thy master agree ?
There is but one mind in all these men , and it is bent against Caesar .
Where the devil should he learn our language ?
Well met , well met , Master Antipholus .
Yet , forgive me , God , That I do brag thus .
Ah , let be , let be !
If that may be then all is well .
Tut , tut , my lord , we will not stand to prate .
There is , there is .
These things are beyond all use , And I do fear them .
The time is come .
He longs to see your head .
Sir , I will answer any thing .
Good lads , how do you both ?
So Guildenstern and Rosencrantz go to 't .
Why had I one ?
This was a merry message .
And speak 't again , my lord .
So I , to find a mother and a brother , In quest of them , unhappy , lose myself .
If thou ask me why , sufficeth my reasons are both good and weighty .
Now I arise .
Hear me a word , For I shall never speak to thee again .
Will you go ?
Why should Titania cross her Oberon ?
And you are well met , Signior Hortensio .
This kindness will I show .
He that keeps nor crust nor crumb , Weary of all , shall want some .
But first I'll turn yon fellow in his grave And then return lamenting to my love .
How that might change his nature , there's the question .
Know'st thou not the duke Hath banished me , his daughter ?
Who's there ?
Thou look'st like him that knows a warlike charge .
Prithee , my king , be quiet .
Music , ho !
I pray you , jest , sir , as you sit at dinner .
Will you come presently ?
There's no true drop of blood in him to be truly touched with love .
If any bark put forth , come to the mart , Where I will walk till thou return to me .
Biondello , what of that ?
From all such devils , good Lord , deliver us !
Alack , alack , Edmund , I like not this unnatural dealing .
Now he begins the story .
Twas told me you were rough and coy and sullen , And now I find report a very liar .
Excellent good .
Why then , the beef , and let the mustard rest .
Enobarbus ?
Sleep thou , and I will wind thee in my arms .
Here was he merry , hearing of a song .
Came you from Padua , from Bellario ?
He holds me well .
O wicked Wall through whom I see no bliss !
Will he tell us what this show meant ?
Use lenity , sweet chuck .
O notable strumpet !
For my part , I am so attired in wonder I know not what to say .
Smile you my speeches as I were a fool ?
I do not know you so good a man as myself .
Had it th ' ability of life to thank you .
Into a thousand parts divide one man , And make imaginary puissance .
A commodity in question , I warrant you. , Come , we'll obey you .
Yea , but so I am apt to do myself wrong .
He's married .
Ay , go your ways , go your ways .
Servant-monster" ?
I will desire you to live in the meantime and eat your victuals .
Thou old unhappy traitor , Briefly thyself remember .
Oh , heaven have mercy on me !
Call thyself "sister , " sweet , for I am thee .
He hath an argosy bound to Tripolis , another to the Indies .
Tedious it were to tell and harsh to hear .
They that have done this deed are honorable .
Not Hermia but Helena I love .
His words were , "Farewell , mistress." Nothing else .
I wish your Worship well .
Give me my robe , for I will go .
Do you doubt that ?
It can not be .
News , my good lord , from Rome .
What if I had said I had seen him do you wrong ?
They have made him drink alms-drink .
And though we lay these honors on this man To ease ourselves of divers slanderous loads , He shall but bear them as the ass bears gold , To groan and sweat under the business , Either led or driven , as we point the way .
Ride thou unto the horsemen on yond hill .
Ay , my good lord .
Possess them not with fear .
But if he be at hand I shall be satisfied .
Well , my dread lord , so must I call you now .
Not yet." The hour's now come .
Why do you speak so startingly and rash ?
What think'st thou then of Stanley ?
Thou teachest me .
No , no , we will hold it as a dream till it appear itself .
Therefore thou liest .
Ready .
Hid'st thou that forehead with a golden crown Where should be branded , if that right were right , The slaughter of the prince that owed that crown And the dire death of my poor sons and brothers ?
Do you amend it then .
By report I know him well .
If to have done the thing you gave in charge Beget your happiness , be happy then , For it is done .
You a man ?
Though Cassio did some little wrong to him , As men in rage strike those that wish them best , Yet surely Cassio , I believe , received From him that fled some strange indignity Which patience could not pass .
Who is so gross That can not see this palpable device ?
And Cassio killed !
A devil !
I know young bloods look for a time of rest .
The noble Brutus is ascended .
Such as she says my lord did say I was .
This sword but shown to Caesar , with this tidings , Shall enter me with him .
If any be Trinculo's legs , these are they .
And so adieu , sir .
Nobody .
I can stand well enough , and I speak well enough .
Pardon , dear father .
To horse , you gallant princes , straight to horse .
I am not made of stones , But penetrable to your kind entreaties , Albeit against my conscience and my soul .
Cassius , be constant .
What news more ?
Go to , then !
How's the day ?
She says enough , yet she's a simple bawd That can not say as much .
He shall kill two of us , and men indeed , But that's no matter .
Tomorrow dinner , then ?
Why , now I see there's mettle in thee , and even from this instant to build on thee a better opinion than ever before .
I do desire no more .
And made your other love , Demetrius , Who even but now did spurn me with his foot , To call me goddess , nymph , divine , and rare , Precious , celestial ?
Vouchsafe to wear this ring .
Within my sword's length set him ; if he 'scape , Heaven forgive him too .
May I know ?
Thus says my king : an if your father's Highness Do not , in grant of all demands at large , Sweeten the bitter mock you sent his Majesty , He'll call you to so hot an answer of it That caves and womby vaultages of France Shall chide your trespass and return your mock In second accent of his ordinance .
I know thou canst not choose .
Music , moody food Of us that trade in love .
Antony , Leave thy lascivious wassails .
Your Dane , your German , and your swag-bellied Hollander , Drink , ho ! , are nothing to your English .
Now you talk of a sheet of paper , I remember a pretty jest your daughter told .
I pray thee tell me truly how thou lik'st her .
Come , cousin , I am sure you love the gentleman .
Tell me where it is .
That's the end .
Be thy mouth or black or white , Do-de , de-de .
Do not go forth today .
She In th' habiliments of the goddess Isis That day appeared , and oft before gave audience , As 'tis reported , so .
And , you know , his means , If he improve them , may well stretch so far As to annoy us all ; which to prevent , Let Antony and Caesar fall together .
Nay , indeed if you had your eyes , you might fail of the knowing me .
The sun is high , and we outwear the day .
I found her trimming up the diadem On her dead mistress .
Stanley did dream the boar did raze his helm , And I did scorn it and disdain to fly .
It were a tedious difficulty , I think , To bring them to that prospect .
You advise me well .
I held the sword and he did run on it .
As he was fortunate , I rejoice at it .
Come on .
Ah , Luciana , did he tempt thee so ?
Nay , she is worse ; she is the devil's dam , and here she comes in the habit of a light wench .
Sheathe your dagger .
Know'st thou not any whom corrupting gold Will tempt unto a close exploit of death ?
Then Edgar was abused .
So are the Prince and Claudio , who accused her Upon the error that you heard debated .
How if your husband start some otherwhere ?
Let us come in , that we may bind him fast And bear him home for his recovery .
His excellence did earn it , ere he had it .
When the mind's free , The body's delicate .
I am to blame .
Why , therefore fire , for I have caught extreme cold .
Besides , I have some business in the town .
The handkerchief !
This grief is crowned with consolation .
Here you may roast your goose .
Hence , and avoid my sight ! , So be my grave my peace as here I give Her father's heart from her. , Call France .
Perhaps some merchant hath invited him , And from the mart he's somewhere gone to dinner .
But , Othello , speak .
Pray you , no more of this .
Look , here I have you .
Here , madam : Conster them .
You'll have coursers for cousins and gennets for germans .
Both ?
Come hither , come !
In brief , Sorrow would be a rarity most beloved If all could so become it .
Thou shalt buy this dear If ever I thy face by daylight see .
Come , sir , I am for you .
I have not heard the clock .
Ay , but not rough enough .
Today the lords you talked of are beheaded .
You do but dally .
You , Roderigo !
What , the chain ?
He , woman .
The king doth love you well .
I cry your worships ' mercy , heartily. , I beseech your worship's name .
Close by , my master .
Good bawcock , 'bate thy rage .
Where got'st thou that goose look ?
They will surely do us no harm .
Dull thing , I say so .
Tis hard ; almost impossible .
You stand .
We must be married , or we must live in bawdry. , Farewell , good Master Oliver , not 'T is no matter .
So , Dolabella , It shall content me best .
William , sir .
But thy vile race , Though thou didst learn , had that in 't which good natures Could not abide to be with .
Scape being drunk for want of wine .
You shall have some part of your will .
Pray heaven I be deceived in you .
Here comes his body , mourned by Mark Antony , who , though he had no hand in his death , shall receive the benefit of his dying , a place in the commonwealth , as which of you shall not ?
Why , whither shall we go ?
Pray heaven it be State matters , as you think , and no conception Nor no jealous toy concerning you .
Fear you not my part of the dialogue .
Ay , madam .
Let me sit down .
But there where I have garnered up my heart , Where either I must live or bear no life , The fountain from the which my current runs Or else dries up , to be discarded thence !
What noise is that ?
One .
When thou once Wast beaten from Modena , where thou slew'st Hirtius and Pansa , consuls , at thy heel Did famine follow , whom thou fought'st against , Though daintily brought up , with patience more Than savages could suffer .
Why should their liberty than ours be more ?
If I could pray to move , prayers would move me .
There's not a nobler man in Rome than Antony .
If the matter were good , my lord , I durst swear it were his .
I prithee name the time , but let it not Exceed three days .
Ay , good my lord .
And so no doubt he is , my gracious madam .
Lord , what though ?
But yet for all that , an if she did not hate him deadly , she would love him dearly .
Safely stowed .
So do I his .
Thou hast braved many men ; brave not me .
Sir , he answered me in the roundest manner he would not .
I know that we shall have him well to friend .
The cease of majesty Dies not alone , but , like a gulf , doth draw What's near it with it .
What should I answer you ?
Good , yet remember whom thou hast aboard .
I'll about And drive away the vulgar from the streets .
What , is there such a place ?
Good Father , how foolish are our minds !
What you have said I will consider , what you have to say I will with patience hear , and find a time Both meet to hear and answer such high things .
I hope , in no place so unsanctified Where such as thou mayst find him .
Why , all our ranks are broke .
So please your grace , the Prologue is addressed .
Now could I drink hot blood And do such bitter business as the bitter day Would quake to look on .
Stand !
Oh , let the heavens Give him defense against the elements , For I have lost him on a dangerous sea .
Why , what's the matter ?
Oh , what a goodly outside falsehood hath !
Tis death to me to be at enmity ; I hate it , and desire all good men's love .
Prithee , put up .
I dare swear this is the right Vincentio .
Fair ladies , you drop manna in the way Of starved people .
The gods withhold me !
Choose your revenge yourself .
Very ill , too .
The terms of our estate may not endure Hazard so dangerous as doth hourly grow Out of his lunacies .
Are not these woods More free from peril than the envious court ?
Some there be that shadows kiss .
There's not a one of them but in his house I keep a servant fee'd .
Didst thou not say he comes ?
Drown thyself ?
Ding , dong , bell .
Twas I that killed her .
Come , down into the boat .
First , forward to the temple .
I'll not fail , if I live .
O , let me make the period to my curse !
He will , an if he live to be a man .
So swift a pace hath thought that even now You may imagine him upon Blackheath , Where that his lords desire him to have borne His bruised helmet and his bended sword Before him through the city .
Yours , if you talk of tales .
Why , mistress , sure my master is horn mad .
Meet presently at the palace .
For , by this light of heaven , I know not how I lost him .
Trust me , I fear it has .
So let it be with Caesar .
Caesar and he are greater friends than ever .
Therefore to our best mercy give yourselves Or , like to men proud of destruction , Defy us to our worst .
By th ' way we met My wife , her sister , and a rabble more Of vile confederates .
Fie , Fie , lieutenant , You'll be ashamed for ever .
We shall find of him A shrewd contriver .
Fine apparition !
I have a file Of all the gentry .
Let me not name it to you , you chaste stars , It is the cause .
Look you , the worm is not to be trusted but in the keeping of wise people , for indeed there is no goodness in the worm .
O Lord , he will hang upon him like a disease !
My liege , your highness now may do me good .
Is 't so , my lords of England ?
When they are in great danger , I recover them .
Claribel .
Fly , masters !
I'll die for 't but some woman had the ring .
Why had I not with charitable hand Took up a beggar's issue at my gates , Who , smirched thus , and mired with infamy , I might have said , "No part of it is mine ; This shame derives itself from unknown loins" ?
So to most noble Caesar .
Nor send you out o ' th ' way ?
My necessaries are embarked .
Both one and other he denies me now .
I pray you do .
My daughter !
But you shall find the band that seems to tie their friendship together will be the very strangler of their amity .
Why did you bring these daggers from the place ?
These many , then , shall die .
His wits are gone .
O , let me speak !
Alone , it was the subject of my theme ; In company I often glanced it .
Calls your Worship ?
What does the tyrant ?
I warrant something from Venice .
And the tears of it are wet .
Before the time I did Lysander see Seemed Athens as a paradise to me .
For your part , To you our swords have leaden points , Mark Antony .
God bless your Grace !
This is the fool that lent out money gratis .
For me , three thousand ducats .
Now I will believe That there are unicorns , that in Arabia There is one tree , the phoenix ' throne , one phoenix At this hour reigning there .
True .
Foolish curs , that run winking into the mouth of a Russian bear and have their heads crushed like rotten apples .
Fortune and victory sit on thy helm !
As you on him , Demetrius dote on you !
Behold , sir .
Thanks for that .
Bind up my wounds !
I shall obey you in all fair commands .
Go get some water , And wash this filthy witness from your hand .
That you do love me , I am nothing jealous .
Why , man , they did make love to this employment .
You are dull , Casca , and those sparks of life That should be in a Roman you do want , Or else you use not .
Will you know them then ?
Truly , she must be given , or the marriage is not lawful .
Yet Count Claudio may hear , for what I would speak of concerns him .
To leave his wife , to leave his babes , His mansion and his titles in a place From whence himself does fly ?
Dost thou hear , lady ?
Ah , cut my lace asunder , That my pent heart may have some scope to beat , Or else I swoon with this dead-killing news !
O Brutus !
Look , with what courteous action It waves you to a more removed ground .
Farewell , good Charles .
Thy lover , Artemidorus" Here will I stand till Caesar pass along , And as a suitor will I give him this .
Room for Antony , most noble Antony !
Madam , I have a touch of your condition , Which can not brook the accent of reproof .
Not now .
Methinks I could not die anywhere so contented as in the king's company , his cause being just and his quarrel honorable .
Marry , that am I and my partner .
That is the voice , Or I am much deceived , of Portia .
Run hence , proclaim , cry it about the streets .
We will hence forthwith To feast and sport us at thy father's house .
But you'll lie like dogs , and yet say nothing neither .
Still be kind And eke out our performance with your mind .
In his livery Walked crowns and crownets .
Here , mighty Theseus .
O God , your only jig-maker .
Heaven preserve you !
What shall we hear of this ?
Not I , my lord , by heaven .
Have mercy , Jesu ! , Soft , I did but dream .
But that I am forbid To tell the secrets of my prison house , I could a tale unfold whose lightest word Would harrow up thy soul , freeze thy young blood ,
What , with Lysander ?
I cry thee mercy , then , for I did think That thou hadst called me all these bitter names .
I know you not .
The less they deserve , the more merit is in your bounty .
Where's my son Edmund ?
And Trinculo is reeling ripe .
God help thee , shallow man .
James Tyrrel , and your most obedient subject .
Fare you well .
He says so , Tranio ?
Look up a-height .
Dromio , nor thou ?
We charge you , in the Prince's name , stand !
Woe , alas !
What mean'st thou by that ?
A mighty man of Pisa .
Three months from twelve , then .
I do not know .
I see you all are bent To set against me for your merriment .
The court awards it , and the law doth give it .
Give him the cup .
Be bold , and take thy stand .
Is this the Prince ?
I humbly thank you .
I hear the news , my lord .
Twelve year since , Miranda , twelve year since , Thy father was the Duke of Milan and A prince of power .
Pray you , look not sad , Nor make replies of loathness .
Your eyes are lodestars , and your tongue's sweet air More tunable than lark to shepherd's ear When wheat is green , when hawthorn buds appear .
Do you hear , Cassio ?
The poop was beaten gold , Purple the sails , and so perfumed that The winds were lovesick with them .
But do you hear , sir , have you married my daughter without asking my goodwill ?
That which ordinary men are fit for , I am qualified in .
Oh , it is monstrous , monstrous .
And so he fell .
They are entirely welcome .
It is backed like a weasel .
Before the time be out ?
Tis well consented .
So hath my lord dared him to single fight .
Hath the fellow any wit that told you this ?
Let's do so .
For they were parted With foul and violent tempest .
Dost thou forget From what a torment I did free thee ?
I have fled myself , and have instructed cowards To run and show their shoulders .
I pray thee , get us some excellent music , for tomorrow night we would have it at the Lady Hero's chamber window
Why , no .
When spake I such a word ?
My lord , whoever journeys to the prince , For God's sake let not us two at home .
I heard the owl scream and the crickets cry .
But till I come again , No bed shall e'er be guilty of my stay , No rest be interposer 'twixt us twain .
And did not she herself revile me there ?
But in this case of wooing , A child shall get a sire , if I fail not of my cunning .
I would I had thy inches .
The reason why the seven stars are no more than seven is a pretty reason .
You told me you salute not at the court but you kiss your hands .
What impossible matter will he make easy next ?
Knock , I say .
I can no more .
Let it be so .
Twas you we laughed at .
I know thee not .
And so good morrow to you every one .
Of this discourse we more will hear anon. , Egeus , I will overbear your will .
Ay , and brought off the field .
Let me not stay a jot for dinner .
Do so .
I am the duke That loved your father .
Come hither , mistress .
Thus do all traitors .
Therefore the sadness is without limit .
Yes .
Come .
No , to their lives ill friends were contrary .
Rebels it at these years ?
My lord is often thus And hath been from his youth .
Bear with him , Brutus .
And brief , good mother , for I am in haste .
Yet say I , he is in love .
It is the greatest admiration in the universal world when the true and aunchient prerogatifes and laws of the wars is not kept .
Will it never be morning ?
What wert thou if the King of Naples heard thee ?
And when shalt thou see him again ?
I can not believe that in her .
The power of Caesar , and His power unto Octavia .
Believe me , King of Shadows , I mistook .
Put off your maiden blushes , avouch the thoughts of your heart with the looks of an empress , take me by the hand , and say "Harry of England , I am thine , " which word thou shalt no sooner bless mine ear withal , but I will tell
It is but change , Titinius , for Octavius Is overthrown by noble Brutus ' power , As Cassius ' legions are by Antony .
What company is this ?
Go to my chamber , put on clothes of mine .
Soft , Caesar .
I had as lief be wooed of a snail .
Till then , think of the world .
The deep of night is crept upon our talk , And nature must obey necessity , Which we will niggard with a little rest .
True , noble prince .
Why , here he comes , swelling like a turkey-cock .
Thither I must , although against my will , For servants must their masters ' minds fulfill .
Why , ay .
O , reason not the need !
Those his goodly eyes , That o'er the files and musters of the war Have glowed like plated Mars , now bend , now turn The office and devotion of their view Upon a tawny front .
It's the wind .
Take not her part .
What though he love your Hermia ?
Upon my honor , Then came each actor on his ass ,
See , and then speak yourselves .
Who is it that can tell me who I am ?
That's good .
He knows not the stop .
Ay , with Cassio .
That eyeless head of thine was first framed flesh To raise my fortunes .
There's matter in 't indeed , if he be angry .
Nay , the dust Should have ascended to the roof of heaven , Raised by your populous troops .
If he be taken , he shall never more Be feared of doing harm .
Ay .
What you would work me to , I have some aim .
I have heard Where many of the best respect in Rome , Except immortal Caesar , speaking of Brutus And groaning underneath this age's yoke , Have wished that noble Brutus had his eyes .
So will I turn her virtue into pitch And out of her own goodness make the net That shall enmesh them all .
Anon we'll drink a measure The table round .
I am amazed and know not what to say .
And that is Claudio .
Bring us the letter .
Never talk to me .
I may not breathe my censure What he might be .
My honored lord !
Dined at home" ?
Should I have answered Caius Cassius so ?
Let us go .
Like to the time o' th' year between the extremes Of hot and cold , he was nor sad nor merry .
Then is Caesar and he forever knit together .
At mine unworthiness , that dare not offer What I desire to give , and much less take What I shall die to want .
But what's your will ?
In troth , 'tis morning .
The minute of their plot Is almost come. , Well done .
I understand not , madam .
You shall Have letters from me to some friends that will Sweep your way for you .
These fifteen years !
Not so young , sir , to love a woman for singing , nor so old to dote on her for anything .
Well , forward , forward !
So smooth he daubed his vice with show of virtue That , his apparent open guilt omitted , I mean his conversation with Shore's wife , He lived from all attainder of suspects .
It is no mean happiness , therefore , to be seated in the mean .
So long ?
He has no children .
I would not hear your enemy say so , Nor shall you do mine ear that violence , To make it truster of your own report Against yourself .
Well , we shall sift him. , Welcome , my good friends !
Is this the monument of Leonato ?
Cheer your heart .
But stay awhile .
I assure you , Carthage .
How think you of it ?
O my son , my son !
Lead , monster ; we'll follow .
We do not mean the coursing snatchers only , But fear the main intendment of the Scot , Who hath been still a giddy neighbor to us .
Caesar should be a beast without a heart If he should stay at home today for fear .
Our foster nurse of nature is repose , The which he lacks , that to provoke in him Are many simples operative , whose power Will close the eye of anguish .
Come , Vaughan .
You know that you are Brutus that speak this , Or , by the gods , this speech were else your last .
Call me what instrument you will , though you can fret me , yet you can not play upon me .
Why , sir , you know this is your wedding day .
Now , for my life , she's wandering to the Tower , On pure heart's love , to greet the tender prince. , Daughter , well met .
How does lieutenant Cassio ?
Harry le Roy .
For when thou gavest them the rod , and put'st down thine own breeches , Prithee , nuncle , keep a schoolmaster that can teach thy fool to lie .
Half afeard to come .
Take from them now The sense of reck'ning ere th ' opposed numbers Pluck their hearts from them .
What is the success ?
Toward Peloponnesus are they fled .
I must away this night toward Padua , And it is meet I presently set forth .
Provide your going ; Choose your own company and command what cost Your heart has mind to .
My name is Proculeius .
I meant plain holy thistle .
Your lordship speaks most infallibly of him .
Hast thou the flower there ?
Regard Titinius , And tell me what thou notest about the field .
Portia , art thou gone ?
And by how much she strives to do him good She shall undo her credit with the Moor .
No , sir , God forbid , but ashamed to kiss .
This is the very painting of your fear .
But tell us , do you hear whether Antonio have had any loss at sea or no ?
Come , Balthasar , we'll hear that song again .
No .
A man , as you are .
Brutus is wise , and were he not in health , He would embrace the means to come by it .
Ay me !
Promise me life , and I'll confess the truth .
Boy !
I forget , But these sweet thoughts do even refresh my labors , Most busiest when I do it .
Yonder sure they are coming .
I am more an antique Roman than a Dane .
Attend the lords of France and Burgundy , Gloucester .
God be wi ' you and keep you and heal your pate .
Down , therefore , and beg mercy of the Duke .
killed a cat ?
No , and swears she never will .
The more I love , the more he hateth me .
An I had been a man of any occupation , if I would not have taken him at a word , I would I might go to hell among the rogues .
What news ?
What , in our house ?
How "seventh cause" ? , Good my lord , like this fellow .
You shall close prisoner rest Till that the nature of your fault be known To the Venetian state. , Come , bring him away .
Tarry a little .
Hortensio , hark .
Drown cats and blind puppies !
Why , so I did , but looked for no reply .
If you knew my business , You would entreat me rather go than stay .
What handkerchief ?
Did he never make you laugh ?
Besides , it should appear that if he had The present money to discharge the Jew , He would not take it .
Here's metal more attractive .
Have all his ventures failed ?
Faith , we met and found the quarrel was upon the seventh cause .
And you , sir .
All but Metellus Cimber , and he's gone To seek you at your house .
Thou art a fellow of a good respect .
Is that the uttermost ?
A single thing , as I am now , that wonders To hear thee speak of Naples .
And your reports have set the murder on .
Why , i ' faith , methinks she's too low for a high praise , too brown for a fair praise , and too little for a great praise .
Directly , I am going to Caesar's funeral .
She speaks .
Your Honor wins bad humors .
No .
Look where she comes .
Yea , Richard , when I know , for I protest As yet I do not .
You are thought here to be the most senseless and fit man for the constable of the watch ; therefore bear you the lantern .
Are we all ready ?
Not in deed , madam , for I can do nothing But what indeed is honest to be done .
O wherefore , Nature , didst thou lions frame ?
Alas , what is the matter ?
Adieu , good Monsieur Melancholy .
It is well done and fitting for a princess Descended of so many royal kings .
How say you , sir ?
If she find him not , To England send him or confine him where Your wisdom best shall think .
This 'tis to feel a tale , not to hear a tale .
Whither am I going ?
I'll put a girdle round about the Earth In forty minutes .
I say , by sorcery he got this isle .
A dire induction am I witness to , And will to France , hoping the consequence Will prove as bitter , black , and tragical .
He knows that you embrace not Antony As you did love , but as you feared him .
O , give me leave .
We are three of them .
Music such as charmeth sleep !
Not so hot .
The clock hath stricken three .
Thou art on thy deathbed .
Do not rise yet .
Ay , to a niggardly host and more sparing guest .
And you too , gentle Hero ?
Let her know 't. , And he will fill thy wishes to the brim With principalities .
To business that we love we rise betimes And go to 't with delight .
Can you deny all this ?
The Duke himself , Or any of my brothers of the state , Can not but feel this wrong as 'twere their own .
Sweet Bassanio , my ships have all miscarried .
Tis true , this god did shake !
For my part , I am sorry it is turned to a drinking .
I dare assure you , sir , 'tis almost two , And 'twill be supper time ere you come there .
But here's a villain that would face me down He met me on the mart , and that I beat him And charged him with a thousand marks in gold , And that I did deny my wife and house. , Thou drunkard , thou , what didst thou mean by this ?
Very well , my lord .
My people do already know my mind And will acknowledge you and Jessica In place of Lord Bassanio and myself .
Ay , but their sense is shut .
Oh , that you bore The mind that I do , what a sleep were this For your advancement !
Enough to purchase what you have made known .
Farewell .
Who chooseth me must give and hazard all he hath." Must give , for what ?
You know tomorrow is the wedding day .
Conception is a blessing , but , as your daughter may conceive , Friend , look to 't .
And my trust , Like a good parent , did beget of him A falsehood in its contrary as great As my trust was , which had indeed no limit , A confidence sans bound .
Then heaven Have mercy on me !
Farewell , great chief .
Is thy name Tyrrel ?
And all my armor laid into my tent ?
There is a kind of merry war betwixt Signor Benedick and her .
What , all my pretty chickens and their dam At one fell swoop ?
Peace , I say !
This may prove food to my displeasure .
Pour on , I will endure .
I am loath to tell you what I would you knew .
Tis a good silling , I warrant you , or I will change it .
What do you here alone ?
Now the witch take me if I meant it thus !
Give me a taper , call up all my people !
And I have been all this day to avoid him .
We two , my lord , Will guard your person while you take your rest And watch your safety .
Who ?
Be collected .
They flatter me .
Pray thee , sweet Mistress Margaret , deserve well at my hands by helping me to the speech of Beatrice .
It must be by his death , and for my part I know no personal cause to spurn at him But for the general .
Why do you speak so faintly ?
Swear not by time to come , for that thou hast Misused ere used , by times ill-used o'erpast .
And tell me now , sweet friend , what happy gale Blows you to Padua here from old Verona ?
Is he come home yet ?
Disloyal ?
Draw thy sword and give me Sufficing strokes for death .
My lord , I will not .
Treason !
He calls us back .
Thus was I , sleeping , by a brother's hand Of life , of crown , of queen at once dispatched , Cut off even in the blossoms of my sin ,
Therefore tremble and depart .
I saw Mark Antony offer him a crown ( yet 'twas not a crown neither , 'twas one of these coronets ) and , as I told you , he put it by once , but , for all that , to my thinking , he would fain have had it .
To a rope's end , sir , and to that end am I returned .
Bring me but to the very brim of it , And I'll repair the misery thou dost bear With something rich about me .
I would have all well betwixt you .
I am never merry when I hear sweet music .
And that you would have me to do !
Do you mark that ?
How did you find the quarrel on the seventh cause ?
So will you wish on me when the rash mood is on .
Black night o'ershade thy day , and death thy life .
Whiles I threat , he lives .
Thanks , you the valiant of this warlike isle That so approve the Moor .
Leave me alone to woo him .
Parted you in good terms ?
No .
Thy gown ?
Better thou Hadst not been born than not t ' have pleased me better .
No , 'tis hereafter to know , but now to promise .
Even so great men great losses should endure .
My lord , I have .
Hark , now I hear them .
Interrupt the monster one word further , and , by this hand , I'll turn my mercy out o ' doors and make a stockfish of thee .
I had rather have a fool to make me merry than experience to make me sad , and to travel for it , too .
Kindness in women , not their beauteous looks , Shall win my love , and so I take my leave , In resolution as I swore before .
For whose sake did I that ill deed ?
To the selfsame tune and words .
You beastly knave , know you no reverence ?
We must follow the leaders .
I think this tale would win my daughter too .
Have you the chain about you ?
One word more Shall make me chide thee , if not hate thee .
What a blow was there given !
They fell together all , as by consent .
There lies your way .
There's hope in 't yet .
Good lords , make all the speedy haste you may .
But 'tis strange .
All these old witnesses , I can not err , Tell me thou art my son Antipholus .
When went there by an age , since the great flood , But it was famed with more than with one man ?
Judge me the world if 'tis not gross in sense That thou hast practiced on her with foul charms , Abused her delicate youth with drugs or minerals That weakens motion .
Good majesty , Herod of Jewry dare not look upon you But when you are well pleased .
Poor souls , they perished .
Than my Lord Hastings no man might be bolder .
I by bargain should Wear it myself .
At your choice , sir .
Best you safed the bringer Out of the host .
So fare you well .
Your castle is surprised , your wife and babes Savagely slaughtered .
What is your pleasure , madam ?
Unto the dignity and height of fortune , The high imperial type of this earth's glory .
Let it be who it is .
What's the matter ?
Dost thou lie still ?
Cousin of Buckingham , a word with you .
Then thou art damned .
Perchance ?
Where is Antony ?
My lord , when at their home I did commend your highness ' letters to them .
And it is marvel he outdwells his hour , For lovers ever run before the clock .
Is 't possible ?
Twill bring you gain or perish on the seas .
It signs well , does it not ?
To 't , luxury , pell-mell , for I lack soldiers .
I see , sir , you are eaten up with passion .
Peace , fool .
Here do you keep a hundred knights and squires , Men so disordered , so debauched and bold That this our court , infected with their manners , Shows like a riotous inn .
With no less religion than if thou wert indeed my Rosalind .
Ancient , what makes he here ?
If you go on thus , you will kill yourself , And 'tis not wisdom thus to second grief Against yourself .
Who , he ?
But how , but how ?
Yet I profess curing it by counsel .
Unless I have mista'en his colors much , Which well I am assured I have not done , His regiment lies half a mile , at least , South from the mighty power of the king .
What is this castle called that stands hard by ?
I was not angry since I came to France Until this instant .
He married but his occasion here .
If thou say so , villain , Thou kill'st thy mistress .
I am sorry For your displeasure , but all will sure be well .
Good heaven , the souls of all my tribe defend From jealousy !
Why , I am sure , if he forfeit thou wilt not take his flesh .
Poor venomous fool Be angry and dispatch .
Which , when I saw rehearsed , I must confess , Made mine eyes water , but more merry tears The passion of loud laughter never shed .
Just , just ; and the men do sympathize with the mastiffs in robustious and rough coming on , leaving their wits with their wives .
But in respect of that , I would fain think it were not .
By this hand , I love thee .
At nine i ' th ' morning here we'll meet again .
Away with the dotard !
Let me say "Amen" betimes , lest the devil cross my prayer , for here he comes in the likeness of a Jew .
How smooth and even they do bear themselves , As if allegiance in their bosoms sat Crowned with faith and constant loyalty .
Hast stolen it from her ?
Your mind may change .
I thank it .
Death of one person can be paid but once , And that she has discharged .
Tis the time's plague when madmen lead the blind .
The juice of it on sleeping eyelids laid Will make or man or woman madly dote Upon the next live creature that it sees .
The one of them contains my picture , Prince .
Your It is not a fashion for the maids in France to kiss before they are married , would she say ?
Ay .
A third can not be matched unless the devil himself turn Jew .
There is no more to say ?
O dear !
Let husbands know Their wives have sense like them .
Incapable and shallow innocents , You can not guess who caused your father's death .
We , Hermia , like two artificial gods , Have with our needles created both one flower , Both on one sampler , sitting on one cushion , Both warbling of one song , both in one key , As if our hands , our sides , voices , and minds , Had been incorporate .
No more , cousin .
That she's the chosen of Signior Hortensio .
She haunts me in every place .
He's worth more sorrow , And that I'll spend for him .
Truly , sir , to wear out their shoes to get myself into more work .
Wilt thou , Strato ?
Ha , ha !
I remember when I was in love I broke my sword upon a stone and bid him take that for coming a- night to Jane Smile .
My master calls me .
Withdraw , my lord .
The princes both make high account of you , I know they do , and I have well deserved it .
Whither away ?
This is a fellow of the selfsame color Our sister speaks of. , Come , bring away the stocks !
Thus when I shun Scylla your father , I fall into Charybdis your mother .
Do not torment me , prithee .
Sirs , take up the corse .
Here , sir !
He had a fever when he was in Spain , And when the fit was on him , I did mark How he did shake .
A very mean meaning .
If I let him go , The debt he owes will be required of me .
Say you so ?
Take him up gently , and to bed with him , And each one to his office when he wakes .
I remember him well , and I remember him worthy of thy praise .
I will give him some relief if it be but for that .
Look how he makes to Caesar .
All is but toys .
My charity is outrage , life my shame , And in that shame still live my sorrows ' rage .
Answer every man directly .
Methought I lay Worse than the mutines in the bilboes .
He that is robbed , not wanting what is stol'n , Let him not know't , and he's not robbed at all .
For Falstaff , he is dead , and we must earn therefore .
Do you triumph ?
I have more cause .
Pray you , if it be , give it me , for I am slow of study .
Upon the corner of the moon There hangs a vap'rous drop profound .
In good time , sir , what's that ?
No shame but mine .
I looked her in the face , and saw her led Between her brother and Mark Antony .
Which of you , if you were a prince's son Being pent from liberty , as I am now , If two such murderers as yourselves came to you , Would not entreat for life ?
And , being men , bearing the will of Caesar , It will inflame you , it will make you mad .
Besides , their writers say , King Pepin , which deposed Childeric , Did , as heir general , being descended Of Blithild , which was daughter to King Clothair , Make claim and title to the crown of France .
On what compulsion must I ?
I will be treble-sinewed , -hearted , -breathed , And fight maliciously .
Why , this ' a heavy chance 'twixt him and you , Your ancient , trusty , pleasant servant Grumio .
No , by no means .
O proper stuff !
O you sir , you , come you hither , sir .
Only I here importune death awhile , until Of many thousand kisses the poor last I lay upon thy lips .
That is he .
No , alas , I found it And I did give 't my husband .
Ay , sir .
Will money buy 'em ?
Do .
Tis wonder that thy life and wits at once Had not concluded all. , He wakes .
Stood the state so ?
My lord , I'll tell you that self bill is urged Which in th ' eleventh year of the last king's reign Was like , and had indeed against us passed But that the scambling and unquiet time Did push it out of farther question .
He sent me word if I said his beard was not cut well , he was in the mind it was .
She must change for youth .
And then , sir , does he this , he does , What was I about to say ?
But did you ever tell him she was false ?
An thou hadst been set i ' th ' stocks for that question , thou'dst well deserved it .
The more fool you for laying on my duty .
They have all stomachs .
No , truly .
No more amazement .
Here , catch this casket .
He hath the jewel of my life in hold , His youngest daughter , beautiful Bianca , And her withholds from me and other more , Suitors to her and rivals in my love , Supposing it a thing impossible , For those defects I have before rehearsed , That ever Katherina will be wooed .
List'ning their fear I could not say "Amen , " When they did say "God bless us ! " Consider it not so deeply .
Think you my uncle did dissemble , grandam ?
By my troth , Nerissa , my little body is aweary of this great world .
Good sir , to the purpose .
May we be gone ?
I hope now thou art not drowned .
Twice then the trumpets sounded , And there I left him tranced .
While that the armed hand doth fight abroad , Th ' advised head defends itself at home .
Our general's wife is now the general .
Come , in what key shall a man take you to go in the song ?
There is means , madam .
I tell thee , churlish priest , A ministering angel shall my sister be When thou liest howling .
My father dead , my fortune lives for me .
Do you hear , masters ?
And you , good yeoman , Whose limbs were made in England , show us here The mettle of your pasture .
O sinful thought !
Shall I entreat a word ?
Zounds , he dies !
Out and alas , that was my lady's voice .
Good countrymen , let me depart alone .
My liege , They are not yet come back .
Herald , save thou thy labor .
Where is my lord the duke of Gloucester ?
A greater gift than that I'll give my cousin .
Behold : it is the privilege of mine honors , My oath , and my profession .
Where am I ?
Fare thee well .
What are you ?
What should we say , my lord ?
This island's mine , by Sycorax my mother , Which thou takest from me .
I will hear further reason for this .
Would thou and those thy scars had once prevailed To make me fight at land !
Not so , I do beseech your Majesty .
And wilt thou have me ?
I shall answer that better to the commonwealth than you can the getting up of the Negro's belly .
If Echo were as fleet , I would esteem him worth a dozen such .
Farewell .
Why then , the devil give him good of it !
And , friends , disperse yourselves .
I'll do 't , my lord .
If you did wear a beard upon your chin , I'd shake it on this quarrel .
Welcome , my lord .
There's money for your pains .
I ' faith , I thank him .
Saw you anything ?
And golden Phoebus never be beheld Of eyes again so royal !
Filths savor but themselves .
He may win , And what is music then ?
Is he of God's making ?
He would make but a sport of it and torment the poor lady worse .
Breathe Merriman , the poor cur is embossed , And couple Clowder with the deep-mouthed brach .
Nay , but he prated And spoke such scurvy and provoking terms Against your honor That , with the little godliness I have , I did full hard forbear him .
I will show you such a necessity in his death that you shall think yourself bound to put it on him .
Even he that makes her queen .
Octavius , then take him to follow thee , That did the latest service to my master .
As easy mayst thou the intrenchant air With thy keen sword impress as make me bleed .
What judgment shall I dread , doing no wrong ?
He that knows better how to tame a shrew , Now let him speak ; 'tis charity to show .
Winter garments must be lined , So must slender Rosalind .
Heaven keep the monster from Othello's mind !
Dost thou not see my baby at my breast , That sucks the nurse asleep ?
I do beseech your Grace pardon me , Who , earnest in the service of my God , Deferred the visitation of my friends .
Heavens thank you for 't !
This purse of ducats I received from you , And Dromio my man did bring them me .
The queen your mother , in most great affliction of spirit , hath sent me to you .
Farewell , my lord .
All the world desires her .
Prithee , away .
Those are the raised father and his friends .
O Dardanius !
Thy mother's poisoned .
The next , our ship , Which , but three glasses since , we gave out split , Is tight and yare and bravely rigged as when We first put out to sea .
But by immortal providence , she's mine .
Go hence with diligence .
Perish the man whose mind is backward now !
Caesar is sad , and Lepidus , Since Pompey's feast , as Menas says , is troubled With the greensickness .
Caesar , I shall .
Brought you Caesar home ?
What proof shall I make of that ?
Twas a sweet marriage , and we prosper well in our return .
Your fortunes are alike .
His very opinion in the letter !
And how does your content Tender your own good fortune ?
I have had four quarrels , and like to have fought one .
Doth it therefore ensue that you should love his son dearly ?
Which dreams indeed are ambition , for the very substance of the ambitious is merely the shadow of a dream .
So are those crisped snaky golden locks Which maketh such wanton gambols with the wind , Upon supposed fairness , often known To be the dowry of a second head , The skull that bred them in the sepulcher .
I doubt some danger does approach you nearly .
O noble Caesar !
Ride you this afternoon ?
O , fear me not .
And I pray thee now tell me , for which of my bad parts didst thou first fall in love with me ?
My sword is drawn .
I must be laughed at If or for nothing or a little , I Should say myself offended , and with you Chiefly i' th' world ; more laughed at , that I should Once name you derogately , when to sound your name It not concerned me .
Do not bid me speak .
Yon ribaudred nag of Egypt , Whom leprosy o'ertake ! , i' th' midst o' th' fight , When vantage like a pair of twins appeared Both as the same , or rather ours the elder , The breeze upon her , like a cow in June , Hoists sails and flies .
What , is Antonio here ?
No , truly .
Madam , he's well .
But for the whole world ?
Hold you the watch tonight ?
Where is my love ?
By th ' mass , and 'tis like a camel indeed .
The goodness of the night upon you , friends !
Stayed it long ?
They are loves I bear to you .
You have , my lord .
Who keeps her company ?
See this dispatched with all the haste thou canst : Anon I'll give thee more instructions .
Nor ever heard , nor ever did suspect .
And , for thou wast a spirit too delicate To act her earthy and abhorred commands , Refusing her grand hests , she did confine thee , By help of her more potent ministers And in her most unmitigable rage , Into a cloven pine , within which rift Imprisoned thou didst painfully remain A dozen years ; within which space she died And left thee there , where thou didst vent thy groans As fast as mill wheels strike .
Tis a very excellent piece of work , madam lady .
Those that will follow Cassius , go with him , And public reasons shall be rendered Of Caesar's death .
What he will do with it Heaven knows , not I. I nothing but to please his fantasy .
Poor soul !
We will be witnesses .
If I do not put on a sober habit , Talk with respect and swear but now and then , Wear prayer books in my pocket , look demurely , Nay more .
Happily met , the happier for thy son .
He will not fight with me , Domitius ?
Well struck !
Well , I will forget the condition of my estate to rejoice in yours .
Rest you happy !
Hereafter , in a better world than this , I shall desire more love and knowledge of you .
If I can cross him any way , I bless myself every way .
Oh , I am spoiled , undone by villains !
Ay , he spoke Greek .
Signior Baptista , you are happily met. , Sir , this is the gentleman I told you of .
My heart is ten times lighter than my looks .
Pray you , away .
Call Claudio and some other of my men .
Dost fall ?
By providence divine .
My lord approaches .
Where yond pine does stand I shall discover all .
Yare , lower , lower !
And not a jot of "Tranio" in your mouth .
That would I , had I kingdoms to give with her .
An now tell me , how doth your cousin ?
Remember me." I have sworn 't .
I pray you , hear her speak .
Ay , my good lord .
Then there's hope a great man's memory may outlive his life half a year .
Soft stillness and the night Become the touches of sweet harmony .
Peace !
She hath betrayed me and shall die the death .
If it be so , It is a chance which does redeem all sorrows That ever I have felt .
Will you shog off ?
Octavia weeps To part from Rome .
I'll bring thee word Straight how 'tis like to go .
Say that I wish he never find more cause To change a master .
Ay , but , lady , That policy may either last so long , Or feed upon such nice and waterish diet , Or breed itself so out of circumstances , That , I being absent and my place supplied , My general will forget my love and service .
Lord , " quoth he ?
By this hand , I'll have that gown .
For I can give his humor the true bent , And I will bring him to the Capitol .
Speak , speak !
I am glad to see your highness .
From my house , if I had it , The sixth of July .
Off with that bauble , throw it underfoot .
But who comes here ?
You are welcome , sir , to Cyprus .
Thieves !
Turn thy complexion there , Patience , thou young and rose-lipped cherubin , , Ay , there , look grim as hell !
If ever thou wilt thrive , bury my body .
What should he be ?
He is in heaven , where thou shalt never come .
Some innocents 'scape not the thunderbolt .
Who then shall blame His pestered senses to recoil and start , When all that is within him does condemn Itself for being there ?
God be wi ' you , princes all .
He had a thousand noses , Horns whelked and waved like the enraged sea .
Those that "Hobgoblin" call you , and "sweet Puck , " You do their work , and they shall have good luck .
These are but wild and whirling words , my lord .
Am I a married man or a bachelor ?
Therefore I promise ye I fear you .
Hound or spaniel , brach or him , Bobtail tyke or trundle-tail , Tom will make them weep and wail .
You are welcome for his sake .
What might be toward , that this sweaty haste Doth make the night joint laborer with the day ?
Farewell .
For by the way I'll sort occasion , As index to the story we late talked of , To part the queen's proud kindred from the prince .
Mutton ?
He is not here .
Let him thank me , that holp to send him thither , For he was fitter for that place than earth .
Striving to better , oft we mar what's well .
Thou livest .
O Harry's wife , triumph not in my woes !
I will not trouble you As yet to question you about your fortunes. , Give us some music , and , good cousin , sing .
Why , but you are now well enough .
What news ?
O ill-dispersing wind of misery !
And buried , gentle Tyrrel ?
I thank God , I thank God !
See , my women , Against the blown rose may they stop their nose , That kneeled unto the buds. , Admit him , sir .
None .
Marry , patience , Or I shall say you are all in all in spleen , And nothing of a man .
Is not this buckled well ?
Lord , how it looks about !
Oh , excellent !
Put out the light , and then put out the light .
No more that thane of Cawdor shall deceive Our bosom interest : go pronounce his present death , And with his former title greet Macbeth .
Then , good my liege , mistake me not so much To think my poverty is treacherous .
Stay till I have read the letter .
Where he arrives he moves All hearts against us .
Marry , your manhood , mew !
Then is he more beholding to you than I .
The tyranny of the open night's too rough For nature to endure .

Our present business Is to general woe .
There are no faces truer than those that are so washed .
Yes , you are .
What's the matter ?
Mine eyes did sicken at the sight and could not Endure a further view .
Lo , where it comes again .
More will I do , Though all that I can do is nothing worth , Since that my penitence comes after all , Imploring pardon .
Say'st me so , friend ?
But what , is Catesby gone ?
Well , sir , get you in .
Question your Grace the late ambassadors With what great state he heard their embassy , How well supplied with noble counselors , How modest in exception , and withal How terrible in constant resolution , And you shall find his vanities forespent Were but the outside of the Roman Brutus , Covering discretion with a coat of folly , As gardeners do with ordure hide those roots That shall first spring and be most delicate .
Nothing ?
Go tread the path that thou shalt ne'er return .
I dreamt last night of the three weird sisters : To you they have showed some truth .
Sir , will you , with those infirmities she owes , Unfriended , new adopted to our hate , Dowered with our curse and strangered with our oath , Take her or leave her ?
How have I offended ?
My lord , I have considered in my mind The late request that you did sound me in .
Go , prepare for dinner .
Therefore , put money in thy purse .
Ready , my lord .
Here's Decius Brutus .
Lucius , who's that knocking ?
His father was called Philip of Macedon , as I take it .
If our eyes had authority , here they might take two thieves kissing .
How now ?
He that has a house to put 's head in has a good headpiece .
This would have seemed a period To such as love not sorrow , but another To amplify too much would make much more And top extremity .
One thing more rests , that thyself execute , to make one among these wooers .
Sir , you say well , and well you do conceive .
I'll attend her here And woo her with some spirit when she comes .
What's to be done ?
Not so , my lord .
Fare you well .
Let their beds Be made as soft as yours and let their palates Be seasoned with such viands" ?
I will .
Why , how now ?
Nay , but the devil take mocking .
Thou'ld'st have , great Glamis , That which cries , "Thus thou must do , " if thou have it , And that which rather thou dost fear to do , Than wishest should be undone .
Go back again and be new beaten home ?
Even for that our love of old , I prithee , Hold thou my sword hilts , whilst I run on it .
I pray you , give me leave .
One word more .
Their residence , both in reputation and profit , was better both ways .
If you do stir abroad , go armed .
Idle old man That still would manage those authorities That he hath given away !
Or else what follows ?
Nay , you were a fragment Of Gneius Pompey's , besides what hotter hours , Unregistered in vulgar fame , you have Luxuriously picked out .
Behind the arras I'll convey myself To hear the process .
Tell him I would speak with him .
Ay , but not enough .
God will revenge it , whom I will importune With earnest prayers , all to that effect .
I love you the better ; the hearers may cry "Amen." God match me with a good dancer !
Enobarbus , Antony Hath after thee sent all thy treasure , with His bounty overplus .
Nay then , let the devil wear black , for I'll have a suit of sables .
He dares not come there for the candle .
Let's alone , And do the murder first .
This morning , like the spirit of a youth That means to be of note , begins betimes .
I have a widow aunt , a dowager Of great revenue , and she hath no child .
Sit i ' th ' middle .
Nor in thine , lord .
Tongue , not a word .
Aye , sir .
She can not deny it .
How comes it ?
So I to her and so she yields to me , For I am rough and woo not like a babe .
Then patiently hear my impatience .
Tell thou the tale !
I do confess my fault , And do submit me to Your Highness ' mercy .
He dies !
Stop that , 'twill fly with the smoke out at the chimney .
What men have you lost , Fluellen ?
In Sicyon .
Sir , I never loved you much , but I ha' praised ye When you have well deserved ten times as much As I have said you did .
I must go seek some dewdrops here And hang a pearl in every cowslip's ear .
And since the quarrel Will bear no color for the thing he is , Fashion it thus : that what he is , augmented , Would run to these and these extremities .
What , did they never whisper ?
An't please your Majesty , 'tis the gage of one that I should fight withal , if he be alive .
And let him ply his music .
No boasting like a fool .
Good morrow , both .
Happy the parents of so fair a child .
How wilt thou do for a father ?
I'll tear her all to pieces !
I thank my noble lord .
But I with blowing the fire shall warm myself .
Upon my life , by some device or other The villain is o'erraught of all my money .
Swounds , show me what thou'lt do .
Off with his son George's head !
Then wherefore should I doubt ?
Ah , he is young , and his minority Is put unto the trust of Richard Gloucester , A man that loves not me nor none of you .
It is young Orlando , that tripped up the wrestler's heels and your heart both in an instant .
How doth the prince ?
It is so too .
We are bound to the like .
Then shall I swear to Kate , and you to me , And may our oaths well kept and prosp'rous be .
My lord ?
She stood and spake .
Indeed , he hath an excellent good name .
Repays he my deep service With such deep contempt ?
This is some minx's token , and I must take out the work ?
There , My music playing far off , I will betray Tawny-finned fishes .
Let the trumpet sound .
Before the eyes of both our armies here , Which should perceive nothing but love from us , Let us not wrangle .
Nay , faith , let me not play a woman .
When could they say till now , that talked of Rome , That her wide walks encompassed but one man ?
Look you for any other issue ?
Pardon me , dear Rosalind .
But , gentle heavens , Cut short all intermission .
Was not that Cassio parted from my wife ?
Do you not hear it ring ?
Saw you the king today , my lord of Derby ?
Hark !
Tis hot , it smokes .
Brutus shall lead , and we will grace his heels With the most boldest and best hearts of Rome .
Hadst thou done so , The kings that have revolted , and the soldier That has this morning left thee , would have still Followed thy heels .
Let the great gods That keep this dreadful pudder o'er our heads Find out their enemies now .
Enjoy thy plainness .
This was a venture , sir , that Jacob served for , A thing not in his power to bring to pass But swayed and fashioned by the hand of heaven .
Not altogether so , sir .
The world's a huge thing .
He's worth no more .
Good night , lieutenant , I must to the watch .
If ever he go alone again , I'll never wrestle for prize more .
Good my lord , bid him welcome .
The sun was not so true unto the day As he to me .
Did he ask for me ?
I grant you .
Stand fast together , lest some friend of Caesar's Should chance , Talk not of standing. , Publius , good cheer .
Then none have I offended .
Which is one ?
Though all things foul would wear the brows of grace , Yet grace must still look so .
Be quiet and depart .
No , I will not .
Leave you !
Give you good morrow .
Thou dost conspire against thy friend , Iago , If thou but think'st him wronged and mak'st his ear A stranger to thy thoughts .
Will you play upon this pipe ?
Call him hither to me , soldier .
I will not come .
I think he only loves the world for him .
I had forgot , three months .
I am but hurt .
Go , vanish into air , away !
Out upon it , old carrion !
There the grown serpent lies .
Dolabella !
Thou dost infect mine eyes .
He hath , my lord .
Then saw you not his face ?
If not , the Fates with traitors do contrive .
Forgot you !
He did receive his letters and is coming .
When Biondello comes , he waits on thee , But I will charm him first to keep his tongue .
Belike 'tis but a rumor .
Sir , he may live .
My resolution and my hands I'll trust , None about Caesar .
Marry , this is miching
Tis here .
I did not think you could have been so angry .
There !
More , more , I prithee , more .
Great Dunsinane he strongly fortifies .
If I quench thee , thou flaming minister , I can again thy former light restore Should I repent me .
How looked he ?
Thou shalt not back till I have borne this corse Into the marketplace .
I , not remembering how I cried out then , Will cry it o'er again .
Worthily spoken , Maecenas .
He is not lolling on a lewd love bed , But on his knees at meditation ; Not dallying with a brace of courtesans , But meditating with two deep divines ; Not sleeping , to engross his idle body , But praying , to enrich his watchful soul .
Sir , He is with Caesar .
At home , my lord .
Alas , the storm is come again !
This is the man .
The "why" is plain as way to parish church : He that a fool doth very wisely hit Doth very foolishly , although he smart , Not to seem senseless of the bob .
And they are gone .
And , sister , as the winds give benefit And convey is assistant , do not sleep , But let me hear from you .
He is , my lord , and safe in Leicester town , Whither , if it please you , we may now withdraw us .
Oh peace , Prince Dauphin !
Dear , they durst not , So dear the love my people bore me , nor set A mark so bloody on the business , but With colors fairer painted their foul ends .
But soft !
There attend my coming .
Fare you well .
The barbarous Scythian , Or he that makes his generation messes To gorge his appetite , shall to my bosom Be as well neighbored , pitied , and relieved As thou my sometime daughter .
Noble captain , come .
At once , good night .
To what effect ?
I have done .
O madam , my old heart is cracked , it's cracked .
Tis said , man , and farewell .
I have not 'scaped drowning to be afeard now of your four legs .
Besides , old Gremio is heark'ning still , And happily we might be interrupted .
Bear me forthwith unto his creditor , And , knowing how the debt grows , I will pay it. , Good Master Doctor , see him safe conveyed Home to my house .
Haste me to know 't , that I , with wings as swift As meditation or the thoughts of love , May sweep to my revenge .
Hast thou found my daughter ?
Come , Hamlet , come , and take this hand from me .
I have forgot your name , but sure that part Was aptly fitted and naturally performed .
Youngling , thou canst not love so dear as I. Graybeard , thy love doth freeze .
I'll end my exhortation after dinner .
What news with you , sir ?
Had she been true , If heaven would make me such another world Of one entire and perfect chrysolite , I'd not have sold her for it .
Royal Queen !
She had a prophesying fear Of what hath come to pass .
Triple-turned whore !
He is the only man of Italy , Always excepted my dear Claudio .
Lay on , Macduff , And damned be him that first cries , "Hold , enough ! " I would the friends we miss were safe arrived .
The earth sings when he touches it .
What , has his daughters brought him to this pass ? , Couldst thou save nothing ?
A spirit , a spirit .
And with my hand I seal my true heart's love .
Thou villain , what sayest thou ?
My good lords both , with all the heed I can .
Nor I , assure thee , Regan. , Edmund , I hear that you have shown your father A childlike office .
No , It is thyself , mine own self's better part , Mine eye's clear eye , my dear heart's dearer heart , My food , my fortune , and my sweet hope's aim , My sole earth's heaven , and my heaven's claim .
That death's unnatural that kills for loving .
And died so ?
My good knave Eros , now thy captain is Even such a body .
He sought my life , But lately , very late .
Catesby , o'erlook the walls .
To serve me well , you all should do me duty : Teach me to be your queen , and you my subjects .
So Fulvia told me .
What is the matter ?
Yet , if you be out , sir , I can mend you .
Have I caught thee ?
Very gladly .
Come , sir , what letters had you late from France ?
From Athens is her house remote seven leagues , And she respects me as her only son .
Up to the breach , you dogs !
Come , go with me .
There's a division betwixt the dukes .
Nor I , my lord , in faith .
I was not born to die on Brutus ' sword .
He hath .
Is 't lost ?
Let me work .
Not I .
Oh , on my soul , my cousin is belied !
The first interr'gatory That my Nerissa shall be sworn on is Whether till the next night she had rather stay , Or go to bed now , being two hours to day .
And must she die for this ?
I must be gone .
If he say so , may his pernicious soul Rot half a grain a day !
Shut doors after you .
I'll prove mine honor and mine honesty Against thee presently if thou dar'st stand .
Trust not Trebonius .
You shall have wine enough , my lord , anon .
I will hide me in the arbor .
Their battles are at hand .
And bid her come hither .
Let this be so .
So I will , my liege , as I live .
What drink'st thou oft , instead of homage sweet , But poisoned flattery ?
Oh , rarely base !
If there come truth from them , As upon thee , Macbeth , their speeches shine , Why , by the verities on thee made good , May they not be my oracles as well , And set me up in hope ?
I can not blame her .
If any , speak , for him have I offended .
If thou didst it , thou art the nonpareil .
The cause is in my will .
The duke be here tonight ?
I and my sword will earn our chronicle .
Let's hear him , for the things he speaks may concern Caesar .
I do beseech you To understand my purposes aright .
And you .
If your Majesties is remembered of it , the Welshmen did good service in a garden where leeks did grow , wearing leeks in their Monmouth caps , which , your Majesty know , to this hour is an honorable badge of the service .
Honest , my lord ?
Good morrow , noble sir .
Peace , peace , Iras .
Art thou the slave that with thy breath hast killed Mine innocent child ?
Some of them will fall tomorrow , I hope .
What private griefs they have , alas , I know not , That made them do it .
Tis pity that thou liv'st To walk where any honest men resort .
Nay , but I bar tonight .
For what is he they follow ?
If she had been blessed , she would never have loved the Moor .
Draw the curtains , so , so , so .
Fare ye well .
Signor Bassanio , hear me .
What is 't you say ?
You see how full of changes his age is .
Did you converse , sir , with this gentlewoman ?
Go not my horse the better , I must become a borrower of the night For a dark hour or twain .
Soft , sir !
Why ever wast thou lovely in my eyes ?
But give me your hand , Menas .
The queen , my lord , is dead .
Tis strange , my Theseus , that these lovers speak of .
His breeding , sir , hath been at my charge .
What do I fear ?
Whither wander you ?
Think of it .
Remember thee !
Will 't please you taste of what is here ?
My cousin means Signor Benedick of Padua .
Here's a spirit .
What's your name , friend ?
What dost thou think ?
You are welcome .
Captain Macmorris , I think , look you , under your correction , there is not many of your nation , Of my nation ?
Well , sir , I will .
All torment , trouble , wonder , and amazement Inhabits here .
Where it seems best unto your royal self .
In what , my dear lord ?
Therefore let every man now task his thought , That this fair action may on foot be brought .
But life itself , my wife , and all the world Are not with me esteemed above thy life .
Come , how wouldst thou praise me ?
Believe me , sir , It carries a brave form .
As from a bear a man would run for life , So fly I from her that would be my wife .
Here comes newer comfort .
Lorenzo and Salerio , welcome hither , If that the youth of my new interest here Have power to bid you welcome .
But , alas , Caesar must bleed for it .
Tis a fearful odds .
If thou hast slain Lysander in his sleep , Being o'er shoes in blood , plunge in the deep , And kill me too .
I will not do them wrong .
Not so , my lord .
I do attend here on the general And think it no addition , nor my wish , To have him see me womaned .
Why comest thou ?
I would thou couldst stammer , that thou might'st pour this concealed man out of thy mouth as wine comes out of a narrow-mouthed bottle , either too much at once , or none at all .
What's he that wishes so ?
What , did he marry me to famish me ?
I prithee , Remember I have done thee worthy service , Told thee no lies , made thee no mistakings , served Without or grudge or grumblings .
Of her society Be not afraid .
Nay , he rubs himself with civet .
Is it concluded that he shall be Protector ?
How far that little candle throws his beams !
I never may believe These antique fables nor these fairy toys .
Good day to both of you .
O , spare my guiltless wife and my poor children ! , Keeper , I prithee sit by me awhile .
I fear it , I promise you .
I'll tell thee , friend , I am almost mad myself .
Those uncles which you want were dangerous .
You know the law .
Be factious for redress of all these griefs , And I will set this foot of mine as far As who goes farthest .
March gently on to meet him .
By this scimitar That slew the Sophy and a Persian prince That won three fields of Sultan Solyman , I would o'erstare the sternest eyes that look , Outbrave the heart most daring on the earth , Pluck the young sucking cubs from the she-bear , Yea , mock the lion when he roars for prey , To win the lady .
Pray , set it down and rest you .
Will you dispatch us here under this tree , or shall we go with you to your chapel ?
Why , then he'll say we stabbed him sleeping .
What shall I do ?
What now , Lucillius ?
Why , then , 'tis none to you , for there is nothing either good or bad , but thinking makes it so .
I'll board him presently .
But it is no matter .
This 'greed upon To part with unhacked edges and bear back Our targes undinted .
Ay , madam .
I robbed his wound of it .
As you from crimes would pardoned be , Let your indulgence set me free .
I am maimed for ever .
I'll keep my oath Patiently to bear my wroth."
My heart is thirsty for that noble pledge .
I pray you , fail me not .
O God , Horatio , what a wounded name , Things standing thus unknown , shall live behind me !
I do not think it good .
Then to the wood will he tomorrow night Pursue her .
Mistress !
The tender prince Would fain have come with me to meet your Grace , But by his mother was perforce withheld .
Therefore I do advise you , take this note .
If not , to say to thee that I shall die is true , but for thy love , by the Lord , no .
I took no more pains for those thanks than you take pains to thank me .
My good friends , I'll leave you till night .
Would 'twere done .
Safe , Antony .
That now I will have , that's the humor of it .
We see yonder the beginning of the day , but I think we shall never see the end of it. , Who goes there ?
The king , sir , hath laid that in a dozen passes between yourself and him , he shall not exceed you three hits .
If the cat will after kind , So , be sure , will Rosalind .
Madam , I go with all convenient speed .
Well , you may fear too far .
Monster , I will kill this man .
By heaven , I do not , I do not , gentlemen. , O murderous coxcomb !
We shall know by this fellow .
Will they not say afterwards , if they should grow themselves to common players ( as it is most like if their means are no better ) , their writers do them wrong to make them exclaim against their own succession ?
What , not a word ?
Here comes Oberon .
What else ?
He hath a heart as sound as a bell , and his tongue is the clapper , for what his heart thinks , his tongue speaks .
The king has killed his heart .
And the rarest that e'er came there .
Give ear , sir , to my sister .
They shall be married tomorrow , and I will bid the duke to the nuptial .
Who could refrain , That had a heart to love , and in that heart Courage to make 's love known ?
I will do so .
Therefore no more but to the matter .
Most like a gentleman .
Come , Dolabella , see High order in this great solemnity .
My estate is very low .
Comes his army on ?
All may be well ; but if God sort it so , 'T is more than we deserve or I expect .
Then , if ever thou dar'st acknowledge it , I will make it my quarrel .
Rage , blow !
So they do nothing , 'tis a venial slip .
Why then , you are in love .
The villain Jew with outcries raised the Duke , Who went with him to search Bassanio's ship .
Thou art thy father's daughter .
But how should Prospero Be living and be here ?
O ye immortal gods !
Why , man , he doth bestride the narrow world Like a Colossus , and we petty men Walk under his huge legs and peep about To find ourselves dishonorable graves .
Think you I am no stronger than my sex , Being so fathered and so husbanded ?
You shall , my lord .
And when you do them , Cassius , be content .
Bid him Report the feature of Octavia : her years , Her inclination .
Call not your stocks for me .
Leave me , I say .
By no means" what ?
His absence , sir , Lays blame upon his promise .
Ay. , Fare you well , fair gentleman .
I your servant .
Write to me very shortly , And you shall understand from me her mind .
She is dead .
Look , where he comes .
Where is he gone ?
The man is innocent .
With who ?
So let him land , And solemnly see him set on to London .
A husband ?
And , dying so , death is to him advantage ; or not dying , the time was blessedly lost wherein such preparation was gained .
Heaven doth truly know it .
Bear me , good friends , where Cleopatra bides .
I do not bid thee call .
My resolution's placed , and I have nothing Of woman in me .
It is not meet you know how Caesar loved you .
Have you not spoken 'gainst the Duke of Cornwall aught ?
Out on thee , seeming !
Since he went from Egypt 'tis A space for farther travel .
Speak , speak .
Here , under leave of Brutus and the rest , For Brutus is an honorable man ; So are they all , all honorable men , Come I to speak in Caesar's funeral .
I pray you , go Along with me .
And those that leave their valiant bones in France , Dying like men though buried in your dunghills , They shall be famed ; for there the sun shall greet them And draw their honors reeking up to heaven , Leaving their earthly parts to choke your clime ,
Would ?
Well , more anon. , Comes the king forth , I pray you ?
My lord , we will not .
Not today , O Lord , Oh , not today , think not upon the fault My father made in compassing the crown .
To be once in doubt Is to be resolved .
For lead ?
Hark how our steeds for present service neigh .
He is a very proper man .
O all you host of heaven !
I had rather be a dog and bay the moon Than such a Roman .
What dost you mean by this ?
Follow , I pray you .
I pray you mar no more trees with writing love songs in their barks .
I must embrace thee .
You wrong me more , sir , in denying it .
I speak not this that you should bear a good opinion of my knowledge , insomuch I say I know you are .
With any strong or vehement importunity .
Or rather bottomless , that as fast as you pour affection in , it runs out .
But I have spoke With one that saw him die , who did report That very frankly he confessed his treasons , Implored your highness ' pardon , and set forth A deep repentance .
That he hath not .
Fair sir , I pity her And wish , for her sake more than for mine own , My fortunes were more able to relieve her .
I go , my lord .
Fast bind , fast find .
I'll then nor give nor hazard aught for lead .
Being done unknown , I should have found it afterwards well done , But must condemn it now .
Ay , every inch a king .
But lest my liking might too sudden seem , I would have salved it with a longer treatise .
I'll see no more .
If he were dead , what would betide on me ?
If that the Turkish fleet Be not ensheltered and embayed , they are drowned .
Ish a villain and a basterd and a knave and a rascal .
No , I warrant your Grace you shall not entreat him to a second , that have so mightily persuaded him from a first .
Upon the stroke of four .
What tidings can you tell me of my lord ?
Sir , fare you well .
Our Italy Shines o'er with civil swords .
Draw , you rascal !
No , none that thou hast wit enough to make .
Very well .
Let's stab ourselves .
To Ireland , I .
Quickly let me have it .
Even this repays me. , We sent our schoolmaster .
I will depart in quiet And , in despite of mirth , mean to be merry .
What , my old worshipful old master ?
Shall I say to Caesar What you require of him ?
Good Portia , go to bed .
I will have my revenge ere I depart his house .
You have me , have you not ?
Your brother the Bastard is fled from Messina .
No more be done .
Thou speak'st with all thy wit ; and yet , i ' faith , With wit enough for thee .
Make assay .
I know not which is which .
I pray you , sir , take patience .
Those that are married already , all but one , shall live .
Ay , but the feet were lame and could not bear themselves without the verse , and therefore stood lamely in the verse .
I never saw you in my life till now .
Say that the last I spoke was "Antony , " And word it , prithee , piteously .
Your constancy Hath left you unattended .
Some say the Earth Was feverous and did shake .
I can not speak of this .
He has brave utensils , for so he calls them , Which when he has a house , he'll deck withal .
I am thy father's spirit , Doomed for a certain term to walk the night And for the day confined to fast in fires , Till the foul crimes done in my days of nature Are burnt and purged away .
Quoth my master .
Nor what I have done by water .
I will compound this strife .
God grant we never may have need of you .
Go charge Agrippa Plant those that have revolted in the vant , That Antony may seem to spend his fury Upon himself .
My lord , I came to see your father's funeral .
A friend of Antony's .
Do you hear aught , sir , of a battle toward ?
Bid them come near .
O noble English , that could entertain With half their forces the full pride of France And let another half stand laughing by , All out of work and cold for action !
Good morrow , Caesar .
And if you wrong us , shall we not revenge ?
Are you now going to dispatch this thing ?
I come but in as others do , to try with him the strength of my youth .
I cry you mercy , uncle. , By your Grace's pardon .
If he could right himself with quarreling , Some of us would lie low .
The wonder is he hath endured so long .
My liege .
You .
Therefore confess thee freely of thy sin , For to deny each article with oath Can not remove nor choke the strong conception That I do groan withal .
For three months , well .
I am afraid , methinks , to hear you tell it .
Is ink and paper ready ?
Speak , is 't out o ' th ' way ?
Yea , my lord .
A proper man .
It would make a man mad as a buck to be so bought and sold .
Nay , an I tell you that , I'll ne'er look you i ' th ' face again .
Yond same black cloud , yond huge one , looks like a foul bombard that would shed his liquor .
O sir , fly this place .
Nay , let's follow him .
The very head and front of my offending Hath this extent , no more .
We have no friend But resolution , and the briefest end .
Where is my wife ?
There's Dolabella sent from Caesar .
This by Calphurnia's dream is signified .
It will be short .
Look , he stirs .
Now , by heaven , My blood begins my safer guides to rule , And passion , having my best judgment collied , Assays to lead the way .
This note doth tell me of ten thousand French That in the field lie slain .
Till he come home again , I would forbear .
Had I been any god of power , I would Have sunk the sea within the earth or ere It should the good ship so have swallowed and The fraughting souls within her .
Even since you left it .
What manner o' thing is your crocodile ?
Nor is he dead , for aught that I can tell .
Ay , so I think .
O proud death , What feast is toward in thine eternal cell , That thou so many princes at a shot So bloodily hast struck ?
What do I see on thee ?
What doth she say , my lord of Buckingham ?
They say this town is full of cozenage , As nimble jugglers that deceive the eye , Dark-working sorcerers that change the mind , Soul-killing witches that deform the body , Disguised cheaters , prating mountebanks , And many suchlike liberties of sin .
Dost thou think If I would stand against thee , would the reposal Of any trust , virtue , or worth in thee Make thy words faithed ?
Stand far off .
Deny to speak with me ?
But thou must needs be sure My spirits and my place have in their power To make this bitter to thee .
What says this leaden casket ?
Mad call I it , for , to define true madness , What is 't but to be nothing else but mad ?
He bears The third part of the world , man .
The general and his wife are talking of it , And she speaks for you stoutly .
Therefore I took your hands , but was indeed Swayed from the point by looking down on Caesar .
Would she were hearsed at my foot and the ducats in her coffin !
I prithee , shepherd , if that love or gold Can in this desert place buy entertainment , Bring us where we may rest ourselves and feed .
If we , with thrice such powers left at home , Can not defend our own doors from the dog , Let us be worried , and our nation lose The name of hardiness and policy .
Shalt see thy other daughter will use thee kindly .
Stay here .
Go to , I'll no more on 't .
Here comes Sir Oliver. , Sir Oliver Martext , you are well met .
Something have you heard Of Hamlet's "transformation" , so call it Since nor th ' exterior nor the inward man Resembles that it was .
Othello's occupation's gone .
How does my old acquaintance of this isle ? , Honey , you shall be well desired in Cyprus , I have found great love amongst them .
Beshrew me but I love her heartily .
Michael Cassio , Lieutenant to the warlike Moor Othello , Is come on shore .
Briefly , I dwell by the Capitol .
What though I be not so in grace as you , So hung upon with love , so fortunate , But miserable most , to love unloved ?
Sound , trumpet !
In nothing am I changed But in my garments .
Thy mother was a piece of virtue and She said thou wast my daughter .
Sir , she can turn , and turn , and yet go on , And turn again .
Y'are a baggage , the Slys are no rogues .
Swear your love .
If he break the peace , he ought to enter into a quarrel with fear and trembling .
No , Lepidus , let him speak .
Keep peace , upon your lives .
And what they may incense him to , being apt To have his ear abused , wisdom bids fear .
I , thus neglecting worldly ends , all dedicated To closeness and the bettering of my mind With that which , but by being so retired , O'erprized all popular rate , in my false brother Awaked an evil nature .
I have , when you have heard what I can say .
Nothing , unless you render her again .
Therefore , as I am bound , Receive it from me .
I will verify as much in his beard .
Nay , that he did not .
Ingratitude , thou marble-hearted fiend , More hideous when thou show'st thee in a child Than the sea monster .
I am so .
Have an eye to Cinna .
I have heard that Julius Caesar Grew fat with feasting there .
I will not fail you .
Oh , do but think You stand upon the rivage and behold A city on th ' inconstant billows dancing , For so appears this fleet majestical Holding due course to Harfleur .
Away , old man .
I shall serve you , sir , Truly , however else .
Yet Edmund was beloved .
Stop it , Marcellus .
My salad days , When I was green in judgment , cold in blood , To say as I said then .
I will assume thy part in some disguise And tell fair Hero I am Claudio , And in her bosom I'll unclasp my heart And take her hearing prisoner with the force And strong encounter of my amorous tale .
Good night , good Captain Blunt .
The town sounds a parley .
But , mistress , know yourself .
So I , being young , till now ripe not to reason .
It is very hot .
Come , "The croaking raven doth bellow for revenge , "
This fellow's of exceeding honesty And knows all quantities , with a learned spirit , Of human dealings .
My wayward husband hath a hundred times
I have been told so of many .
That would hang us , every mother's son .
Oh , lay me by my mistress ' side .
Come , Charmian .
Mad for thy love ?
Stars , my lord .
For this relief much thanks .
All men I hope live so .
I would not kill thy unprepared spirit .
But say , I prithee , is he coming home ?
Give me a living reason she's disloyal .
Who's there ?
I have a pain upon my forehead , here .
If 'twere no other , 'T is but so , I warrant .
Shall I do that which all the Parthian darts , Though enemy , lost aim and could not ?
In faith , my hand meant nothing to my sword .
My visor is Philemon's roof ; within the house is Jove .
Follow him , friends .
Welcome , dear madam .
What news ?
Would you praise Caesar , say "Caesar." Go no further .
He can not like her long .
Hold , for your lives !
Gloucester , 'tis true that we are in great danger .
Appear and pertly ! , No tongue .
Draw , you rogue , or I'll so carbonado your shanks .
Are they so followed ?
I'll follow you .
Horrible steep .
This is the door .
I am dumb .
Is 't possible ?
They bleed on both sides. , How is it , my lord ?
Answer my life my judgment , Thy youngest daughter does not love thee least , Nor are those empty-hearted whose low sound Reverbs no hollowness .
By my troth , my lord , I can not tell what to think of it , but that she loves him with an enraged affection , it is past the infinite of thought .
Do but look up .
Is 't possible ?
It shall be done , my lord .
Yes , that thou didst .
Believe me , sir , had I such venture forth , The better part of my affections would Be with my hopes abroad .
The business of the state does him offence , And he does chide with you .
So were you .
Husband , I'll dine above with you today , And shrive you of a thousand idle pranks .
In my mind's eye , Horatio .
O woeful day !
Beg another of thy daughters .
I will be mild and gentle in my words .
The one of them imports The death of Cassio to be undertook By Roderigo .
Let me go .
Is there any ships put forth tonight ?
I am ready now .
The passages of alleys , creeks , and narrow lands ; A hound that runs counter and yet draws dryfoot well , One that before the judgment carries poor souls to hell .
Let me not hinder , Cassius , your desires .
God save the foundation !
Therefore the Dukes of Berri and of Brittany , Of Brabant and of Orleans , shall make forth , And you , Prince Dauphin , with all swift dispatch , To line and new-repair our towns of war With men of courage and with means defendant .
An honest mind and plain , he must speak truth .
I am .
Thou must not take my former sharpness ill .
Royal Lear , Whom I have ever honored as my king , Loved as my father , as my master followed , As my great patron thought on in my prayers , The bow is bent and drawn .
Here is my bed .
The matter ?
It sounds no more , and sure , it waits upon Some god o ' th ' island .
Thou art a traitor , Off with his head .
For mine own part , I shall be glad to learn of noble men .
That thou dost love my daughter from thy soul .
Welcome , good Robin .
What says your Highness to my just request ?
The good years shall devour them , flesh and fell , Ere they shall make us weep .
Hark thee , Clitus .
Hark , hark !
Why grow the branches when the root is gone ?
Prithee , Emilia , Go know of Cassio where he supped tonight. ,
Thither will I invite the duke and all's contented followers .
Take you some company , and away to horse .
I know no touch of it , my lord .
Tis so .
My friend , thy husband , honest , honest Iago .
I am a tainted wether of the flock , Meetest for death .
Tell me at whose suit .
Am I not wise ?
Question enrages him .
Go then and muster men , but leave behind Your son George Stanley .
Ay , amen !
Sure , her offense Must be of such unnatural degree That monsters it ( or your fore-vouched affection Fall into taint ) , which to believe of her Must be a faith that reason without miracle Could never plant in me .
Nay , get thee gone .
Ay , I thank God , my father , and yourself .
Well thought on .
I pray you watch about Signior Leonato's door , for the wedding being there tomorrow , there is a great coil tonight .
Tomorrow , as he purposes .
Why , there then !
The French have reinforced their scattered men .
Tis even so , For let our finger ache and it endues Our other healthful members even to that sense Of pain .
This lion is a very fox , for his valor .
How now ?
There be fools alive , iwis , Silvered o'er , and so was this .
Draw together .
When the moon shone we did not see the candle .
Come to me , Tyrrel , soon at after-supper , When thou shalt tell the process of their death .
Tweaks me by the nose ?
I fly , Biondello .
The ship was under sail .
Marry , for my part , I think the duke hath lost never a man , but one that is like to be executed for robbing a church , one Bardolph , if your Majesty know the man .
That's not an office for a friend , my lord .
Teach it but how , And thou shalt see how apt it is to learn Any hard lesson that may do thee good .
But say , sir , is it dinnertime ?
There's husbandry in heaven ; Their candles are all out .
Hang there , my verse , in witness of my love .
Stand still .
You must away tonight .
And I am Brutus , Marcus Brutus , I !
Nay , that's true , that's very true .
Even now we housed him in the abbey here , And now he's there , past thought of human reason .
Good my friends , consider You are my guests .
Call forth my household servants .
And , as the jest did glance away from me , 'T is ten to one it maimed you two outright .
Phoebe , with all my heart .
Lovers , make moan .
Or , failing so , yet that I put the Moor At least into a jealousy so strong That judgment can not cure .
If then they chanced to slack you , We could control them .
When being not at your lodging to be found The Senate hath sent about three several guests To search you out .
I love your majesty According to my bond , no more nor less .
I did not .
He should , for that , commit your godfathers .
His captain's heart , Which in the scuffles of great fights hath burst The buckles on his breast , reneges all temper And is become the bellows and the fan To cool a gypsy's lust .
But he sleeps .
Where is Lucentio ?
Marry , well remembered .
Come on .
I will be hanged , if some eternal villain , Some busy and insinuating rogue , Some cogging , cozening slave , to get some office , Have not devised this slander .
This making Christians will raise the price of hogs .
Should be" , should buzz !
I pity thy complaining .
And how long is that , think you ?
Give him heedful note .
Not poppy nor mandragora Nor all the drowsy syrups of the world , Shall ever medicine thee to that sweet sleep Which thou owedst yesterday .
What dost thou with thy best apparel on ?
Were 't my fitness To let these hands obey my blood , They are apt enough to dislocate and tear Thy flesh and bones .
Rogue , thou hast lived too long .
For as thou urgest justice , be assured Thou shalt have justice more than thou desirest .
O my son , what theme ?
Her name , that was as fresh As Dian's visage , is now begrimed and black As mine own face .
You'll "never trust his word after." Come , 'tis a foolish saying .
Be wary , then .
Come hither , sirrah .
I have great comfort from this fellow .
Keep your word , Phoebe , that you'll marry me Or else , refusing me , to wed this shepherd .
Is not this Stephano , my drunken butler ?
She's a most triumphant lady , if report be square to her .
Shall I be frighted when a madman stares ?
O sweet bully Bottom !
Leave you your power to draw , And I shall have no power to follow you .
Le chien est retourne a son propre vomissement , et la truie lavee au bourbier." Thou mak'st use of anything .
Very good !
These things to hear Would Desdemona seriously incline .
Well , sir , I'll bring you to our master Lear And leave you to attend him .
Marry , sir , with needle and thread .
The gods do this in shame of cowardice .
Heavens make our presence and our practices Pleasant and helpful to him !
Let it be a quarrel between us , if you live .
Ay , he was porn at Monmouth , Captain Gower .
And for my sister and her princely sons , Be satisfied , dear God , with our true blood , Which , as thou know'st , unjustly must be spilt .
We'll ha 't tomorrow night .
Oh , damn her , damn her !
But canst thou guess that he doth aim at it ?
Thou liest .
Rise , and lend thine ear .
No , pray thee , good Meg , I'll wear this .
Let me be married to three kings in a forenoon and widow them all .
I am young , but something You may deserve of him through me , and wisdom To offer up a weak , poor , innocent lamb T ' appease an angry god .
Two thousand ducats by the year of land !
Niece , will you look to those things I told you of ?
Madam ?
Is she shrill-tongued or low ?
If I be waspish , best beware my sting .
Content , in faith .
No , Cassius , no .
How is it , general ?
Stand , ho !
I dare say you love him not so ill to wish him here alone , howsoever you speak this to feel other men's minds .
Tucket Once more I come to know of thee , King Harry , If for thy ransom thou wilt now compound , Before thy most assured overthrow .
Look in upon me then and speak with me , Or , naked as I am , I will assault thee .
You must to Parthia .
You do mistake your business .
Believe me for mine honor , and have respect to mine honor that you may believe .
We will not fail .
Here , here , sir !
The gain I seek is quiet in the match .
And I , my lord .
You rub the sore When you should bring the plaster .
Why , what a monstrous fellow art thou , thus to rail on one that is neither known of thee nor knows thee !
I remember the story .
It droppeth as the gentle rain from heaven Upon the place beneath .
What villain touched his body , that did stab , And not for justice ?
Tomorrow is the joyful day , Audrey .
Who is here so base that would be a bondman ?
Nor no one here , for curses never pass The lips of those that breathe them in the air .
And did they bid you tell her of it , madam ?
For she his hairy temples then had rounded With a coronet of fresh and fragrant flowers , And that same dew , which sometime on the buds Was wont to swell like round and orient pearls , Stood now within the pretty flowerets ' eyes Like tears that did their own disgrace bewail .
Marry , my uncle Clarence ' angry ghost .
This blue-eyed hag was hither brought with child And here was left by th ' sailors .
Let it not , Brutus .
I'll have no halves .
Madam , in Rome .
I am sure the duke Will never grant this forfeiture to hold .
I can not go no further .
The French is gone off , look you , and there is gallant and most prave passages .
How now , my love ?
Twas this flesh begot Those pelican daughters .
Though it be honest , it is never good To bring bad news .
Indeed , upon my sword , indeed .
You take pleasure then in the message ?
My lord , I do not know that I did cry .
Mistress , what cheer ?
To plainness honor's bound When majesty falls to folly .
Thy master is a wise and valiant Roman .
You have too courtly a wit for me .
Therefore use thy discretion .
O lady , speak again !
The gods best know , Oh never was there queen So mightily betrayed !
I do consent , Prick him down , Antony .
How now ?
It is the quality o ' th ' climate .
Well met , Corporal Nym .
When I came back , For this was brief , I found them close together At blow and thrust , even as again they were When you yourself did part them .
Your gentleness shall force More than your force move us to gentleness .
Captain , I thee beseech to do me favors .
Go , Eros , send his treasure after .
Ay , too gentle .
That's all one .
No , faith , die by attorney .
I have forsworn his bed and company .
Therefore speak .
How fares our cousin Hamlet ?
For the best turn i' th' bed .
Sink Rome !
Come on .
Dost thou mock me ?
Ay me , it is my husband .
Certain , men should be what they seem .
The more pity that fools may not speak wisely what wise men do foolishly .
Tis not to make me jealous To say my wife is fair , feeds well , loves company , Is free of speech , sings , plays , and dances .
Gertrude , do not drink .
Thou shalt be whipped with wire and stewed in brine , Smarting in ling'ring pickle !
Therefore , hear me , Hermia .
Die and be damned , and It is well .
In his own grace he doth exalt himself More than in your addition .
Sweets to the sweet .
Are all thy conquests , glories , triumphs , spoils , Shrunk to this little measure ?
Good Lord , how bright and goodly shines the moon !
Why , then Othello and Desdemona return again to Venice .
Make me to see 't , or at the least so prove it That the probation bear no hinge nor loop To hang a doubt on , or woe upon thy life !
Ah , thou spell !
Doth not the day break here ?
If she be false , heaven mocked itself .
Oh , my daughter !
His horse is slain , and all on foot he fights , Seeking for Richmond in the throat of death .
I wonder what it bodes .
Tell him I'll knock his leek about his pate Upon Saint Davy's day .
I have heard it said so .
Who's there ?
You're sad , Signior Balthasar .
I am here already , sir .
He is already named and gone to Scone To be invested .
Shall I be tempted of the devil thus ?
Let your epilogue alone .
But , alas the while !
You peasant swain !
Who am I , sir ?
Thou know'st not gold's effect .
Yet I have not seen So likely an ambassador of love .
Neglected , rather , And then when poisoned hours had bound me up From mine own knowledge .
What is the course and drift of your compact ?
We have cause to be glad that matters are so well digested .
Sir ?
Hear me with patience .
What is 't you seek ?
I am ashamed I did yield to them .
Dost thou hear , my honest friend ?
It touches you , my lord , as much as me .
I will not sleep , Hortensio , till I see her , And therefore let me be thus bold with you To give you over at this first encounter , Unless you will accompany me thither .
But next day I told him of myself , which was as much As to have asked him pardon .
What raiment will your Honor wear today ?
Not yet , my cousin .
I am for it , lieutenant , and I'll do you justice .
I will survey th ' inscriptions back again .
The I thank you .
They are about the court , And , as I think , they have already order This night to play before him .
What he hath uttered I have writ my sister .
Along with them They brought one Pinch , a hungry , lean-faced villain , A mere anatomy , a mountebank , A threadbare juggler , and a fortune-teller , A needy , hollow-eyed , sharp-looking wretch , A living dead man .
Will you , I pray , demand that demi-devil Why he hath thus ensnared my soul and body ?
God and the rope-maker bear me witness That I was sent for nothing but a rope .
Oh , is this he ?
They mean this night in Sardis to be quartered .
You are unkind , Demetrius .
Who alone suffers , suffers most i ' th ' mind , Leaving free things and happy shows behind .
To do what , Signior ?
You may light on a husband that hath no beard .
So you walk softly , and look sweetly , and say nothing , I am yours for the walk , and especially when I walk away .
To tell you where he lodges is to tell you where I lie .
Sweet , say on .
I may not , madam .
A sailor's wife had chestnuts in her lap , And munched , and munched , and munched .
What is Thisbe ?
But , sir , here comes your boy .
What complexion is she of ?
And when goes hence ?
Thy Edward he is dead , that killed my Edward , Thy other Edward dead , to quit my Edward ; Young York , he is but boot , because both they Matched not the high perfection of my loss .
And she goes down at twelve .
Have the pioneers given o'er ?
Drones hive not with me .
Behold the ordnance on their carriages , With fatal mouths gaping on girded Harfleur .
Oh , banish me , my lord , but kill me not !
He has almost supped .
Give me leave , Caesar .
O wonderful , wonderful , and most wonderful wonderful , and yet again wonderful , and after that , out of all whooping !
The duke my father loved his father dearly .

Good morrow , sweet Hero .

Are you crept hither to see the wrestling ?
The god of Jupiter .
Meet me by and by at the citadel .

Little" again ?
Fulvia is dead .
Shall I strike now ?
Therefore then , thou gaudy gold , Hard food for Midas , I will none of thee .
I did very well note him .
How is 't with me when every noise appals me ?
He lies not like the living .
I now repent I told the pursuivant , As too triumphing , how mine enemies Today at Pomfret bloodily were butchered , And I myself secure in grace and favor .
I heard him say , Brutus and Cassius Are rid like madmen through the gates of Rome .
How does my wife ?
Gentlemen , you are welcome to Elsinore .
For love of God , forbear him .
Be comforted , good madam .
I must needs tell thee all .
Sir , she is mortal .
Within this three mile may you see it coming ; I say , a moving grove .
Is Banquo gone from court ?
I will tell you .
How parted he with thee ?
Come , my spade .
I'll rather kill myself .
I will go on the slightest errand now to the Antipodes that you can devise to send me on .
When Nature hath made a fair creature , may she not by Fortune fall into the fire ?
Well , to our work alive .
These both put off , a poor petitioner , A care-crazed mother to a many sons , A beauty-waning and distressed widow , Even in the afternoon of her best days , Made prize and purchase of his wanton eye , Seduced the pitch and height of his degree To base declension and loathed bigamy .
If it be mine , Keep it not from me .
Dear my lord , Make me acquainted with your cause of grief .
By 'r lady , I think it be so .
Look how our partner's rapt .
Mistress and master , you have oft inquired After the shepherd that complained of love , Who you saw sitting by me on the turf , Praising the proud disdainful shepherdess That was his mistress .
Now shall you see the other .
Here comes the Emperor .
Tis true , my brother's daughter's Queen of Tunis , So is she heir of Naples , 'twixt which regions There is some space .
You have among you killed a sweet and innocent lady .
Tis mine and I will have it .
Give me your hand first .
Well , well , We shall thrive now. , Seest thou , my good fellow ?
If consequence do but approve my dream My boat sails freely , both with wind and stream .
I will not be long from you .
Will you have her ?
No !
Get thee to bed .
Most veritable , therefore look to 't well .
Shall I go fetch your nightgown ?
Who , Hero ?
A man may see how this world goes with no eyes .
But near him thy angel Becomes afeard , as being o'erpowered .
Sir , are not you my father ?
You are passing welcome , And so I pray you all to think yourselves .
All that is spoke is marred .
Gentlemen , rise .
And I , my royal sovereign .
Well , go to , I will .
My learned lord , we pray you to proceed And justly and religiously unfold Why the law Salic that they have in France Or should or should not bar us in our claim .
Canst thou hold up thy heavy eyes awhile , And touch thy instrument a strain or two ?
But I am constant as the northern star , Of whose true-fixed and resting quality There is no fellow in the firmament .
Good faith , and when I met this holy man , The men you talk of came into my mind .
What is he , Biondello ?
I never hated thee .
Where is thy instrument ?
Fear me not. , She and the duke her husband !
Their shadows seem A canopy most fatal , under which Our army lies , ready to give up the ghost .
Had we done so at first , we had droven them home With clouts about their heads .
Who ?
He says his name's Poor Tom .
But now , my lord .
But did you not request to have it cut ?
Call it my fear That keeps you in the house , and not your own .
If then that friend demand why Brutus rose against Caesar , this is my answer : not that I loved Caesar less , but that I loved Rome more .
I am called Dercetus .
Whither is he going ?
This feather stirs .
He did comply , sir , with his dug before he sucked it .
Very like a whale .
For my Lord Lackbeard there , he and I shall meet , and till then peace be with him .
Write to him , I will subscribe , gentle adieus and greetings .
I tell thee , I , that thou hast marred her gown .
I , sir ?
Ah , Desdemona , away , away , away !
Her worth being mounted on the wind , Through all the world bears Rosalind .
Be of good cheer .
That's my office .
That will I , should I die the hour after .
I will piece out the comfort with what addition I can .
I saw Bassanio and Antonio part .
Thou dost talk nothing to me .
It is too heavy for your Grace to wear .
Are you there , wife ?
For my dinner .
The king enacts more wonders than a man , Daring an opposite to every danger .
I'll claim that promise at your Grace's hands .
Do as I bid you .
From the four corners of the earth they come To kiss this shrine , this mortal breathing saint .
What many men desire" , that "many" may be meant By the fool multitude that choose by show , Not learning more than the fond eye doth teach ; Which pries not to th ' interior , but like the martlet Builds in the weather on the outward wall , Even in the force and road of casualty .
He leads himself .
Fie upon thee !
Farewell .
Mark Antony In Egypt sits at dinner , and will make No wars without doors .
My father watches .
Sweet marjoram .
It can not be .
For she is wise , if I can judge of her .
Are you a man ?
Would the night were come !
I , sir , am Dromio .
I would thou hadst been son to some man else .
Fathers that wear rags Do make their children blind .
Whither indeed , before thy here-approach , Old Siward , with ten thousand warlike men , Already at a point , was setting forth .
Madam , I heard her speak .
Before you hazard , for in choosing wrong I lose your company .
Methoughts that I had broken from the Tower And was embarked to cross to Burgundy , And in my company my brother Gloucester , Who from my cabin tempted me to walk Upon the hatches .
Sit , worthy friends .
By day and night he wrongs me .
Whom should I knock ?
I can tell your Majesty , the duke is a prave man .
Let's away And get our jewels and our wealth together , Devise the fittest time and safest way To hide us from pursuit that will be made After my flight .
Rather your eyes must with his judgment look .
Go to thy cold bed and warm thee .
Abhorred villain !
Once more , what news ?
Didst thou not hear somebody ?
You have put him down , lady , you have put him down .
I stay too long .
Oh !
Give me thy hand .
I'll halt after .
She's dead too , our sovereign .
Fie , what a question's that If thou wert near a lewd interpreter !
Go to the pulpit , Brutus .
Hath not a Jew eyes ?
I heard him swear his affection .
Make forth .
I will not say you shall see a masque , but if you do then it was not for nothing that my nose fell a-bleeding on Black Monday last at six o'clock i ' th ' morning falling out that year on Ash Wednesday was four year in th ' afternoon .
So is the fame .
Had you not been their father , these white flakes Did challenge pity of them .
O hell-kite !
Thou art a cobbler , art thou ?
A sweeter and a Lovellier gentleman , Framed in the prodigality of nature , Young , valiant , wise , and , no doubt , right royal , The spacious world can not again afford .
Brother , my lord the duke , Stand to and do as we .
Is it new and old too ?
E'en so , my lord .
Darkness and devils !
We should have met you By sea and land , supplying every stage With an augmented greeting .
What , art thou waking ?
O coz , coz , coz , my pretty little coz , that thou didst know how many fathom deep I am in love .
A second Daniel ! , A Daniel , Jew !
He hath lost his fellows And strays about to find 'em .
What , Pindarus !
I'll follow thee and make a heaven of hell , To die upon the hand I love so well .
Nay then , come on , and take the chance of anger .
What art thou that keep'st me out from the house I owe ?
Before my God , I might not this believe Without the sensible and true avouch Of mine own eyes .
What , and stake down ?
What wouldst thou ?
What a pretty thing man is when he goes in his doublet and hose and leaves off his wit !
Your eyes drop millstones , when fools ' eyes drop tears .
What news , what news in this our tott'ring state ?
Why ?
There was a noise , That's verily .
Farewell , everyone .
But yet I feel I fear .
He is in earnest .
My charge was but to fetch you from the mart Home to your house , the Phoenix , sir , to dinner .
Good grandam , tell us , is our father dead ?
I found him under a tree like a dropped acorn .
Good .
We are such stuff As dreams are made on , and our little life Is rounded with a sleep .
Gallus , go you along .
But fare you well .
Nor I , my lord .
There is but one hope in it that can do you any good , and that is but a kind of bastard hope neither .
Then I know My answer must be made .
Where will the old duke live ?
I set him there , sir , but his own disorders Deserved much less advancement .
And since you know you can not see yourself So well as by reflection , I , your glass , Will modestly discover to yourself That of yourself which you yet know not of .
A goodly one , in which there are many confines , wards , and dungeons , Denmark being one o ' th ' worst .
The lieutenant tonight watches on the court of guard .
The sky doth frown and lour upon our army .
I know him well .
Good day and happiness , dear Rosalind .
Some o' their plants are ill-rooted already .
What's this to my Lysander ?
Did I , Charmian , Ever love Caesar so ?
You English princes all , I do salute you .
The venom clamors of a jealous woman Poisons more deadly than a mad dog's tooth .
Where are they ?
And there is a forerunner come from a fifth , the Prince of Morocco , who brings word the prince his master will be here tonight .
Why , all these should be in the lanthorn , for all these are in the moon. , But silence !
What does he say of Brutus ?
Go to , charm your tongue .
This is not altogether fool , my lord .
That were a kind of bastard hope indeed .
Mobled queen" is good .
Ay , my lord .
Alexander , God knows and you know , in his rages and his furies and his wraths and his cholers and his moods and his displeasures and his indignations , and also being a little intoxicates in his prains , did , in his ales and his angers , look you , kill his best friend , Cleitus .
Master , mean you so ?
Say what you will , sir , but I know what I know .
Here comes Kent .
Sirrah , naked fellow , Poor Tom's a-cold .
Ask her forgiveness ?
The Hyrcanian deserts and the vasty wilds Of wide Arabia are as thoroughfares now For princes to come view fair Portia .
None but friends .
Quail , crush , conclude , and quell !
Now , my dearest Queen , Pray you , stand farther from me .
Where is your servant Caius ?
Get your apparel together , good strings to your beards , new ribbons to your pumps .
For my part , the sea can not drown me .
Oh , that brave Caesar !
What is 't ?
Poor man !
You shall try but one fall .
Let me go with you .
But though we think it so , it is no matter .
Nay , I have offered all , I have no more , And she can have no more than all I have .
I will deal in poison with thee , or in bastinado , or in steel .
What , you mean my face ?
And my help .
And what art thou that dar'st Appear thus to us ?
Let us withdraw .
Why will you mew her up , Signior Baptista , for this fiend of hell And make her bear the penance of her tongue ?
Scorn and defiance , slight regard , contempt , And anything that may not misbecome The mighty sender , doth he prize you at .
The phrase would be more germane to the matter if we could carry cannon by our sides .
This the Dauphin speaks .
No matter whither , so you come not here .
Shall I strike at it with my partisan ?
Who intercepts my expedition ?
Let go his arm .
Sblood , an arrant traitor as any 's in the universal world , or in France , or in England !
I'll do 't , but it dislikes me .
But there is , sir , an eyrie of children , little eyases , that cry out on the top of question and are most tyrannically clapped for 't .
Count Claudio ?
So Chrish save me , I will cut off your head .
It is a paltry cap , A custard-coffin , a bauble , a silken pie .
You durst not so have tempted him .
Here comes Baptista .
Cure her of that .
She can not endure to hear tell of a husband .
Doth thy other mouth call me ?
What kind of help ?
But why should honor outlive honesty ?
For these fellows of infinite tongue , that can rhyme themselves into ladies ' favors , they do always reason themselves out again .
For you must understand he goes but to see a noise that he heard , and is to come again .
I never looked for better at his hands After he once fell in with Mistress Shore .
Why , friends , you go to do you know not what .
I find here that Don Pedro hath bestowed much honor on a young Florentine called Claudio .
Heaven truly knows that thou art false as hell .
Good time of day unto my gracious lord .
Mass , and my elbow itched , I thought there would a scab follow .
Fie , now you run this humor out of breath .
She is a royal princess .
I must tell you then .
Some men there are love not a gaping pig , Some that are mad if they behold a cat , And others , when the bagpipe sings i ' th ' nose , Can not contain their urine .
Our bodies are our gardens , to the which our wills are gardeners .
I find you passing gentle .
No .
How dost thou , Benedick , the married man ?
That's more to me than my wetting .
Come , your answer in broken music , for thy voice is music and thy English broken .
So , so , so .
Pluck but his name out of his heart and turn him going .
The foul fiend follows me !
True .
Run , run , O , run !
The mobled queen" ?
Tis true , most worthy signior .
The rarer action is In virtue than in vengeance .
How shall I know thee again ?
Have by some surgeon , Shylock , on your charge , To stop his wounds lest he do bleed to death .
Do so , and after two days I will discharge thee .
She doth stray about By holy crosses , where she kneels and prays For happy wedlock hours .
Where should Othello go ? , Now , how dost thou look now ?
Methought the billows spoke and told me of it , The winds did sing it to me , and the thunder , That deep and dreadful organ pipe , pronounced The name of Prosper .
Would it not grieve a woman to be overmastered with a piece of valiant dust ?
I can not blame thee now to weep , For such an injury would vex a very saint , Much more a shrew of thy impatient humor .
Are you not well ?
Shall I tell you why ?
Coraggio , bully-monster , If these be true spies which I wear in my head , here's a goodly sight .
That which I gave you .
Such a mad marriage never was before .
If thou read this , O Caesar , thou mayst live .
But here comes Antony .
But who comes here ?
For his bounty , There was no winter in 't , an autumn 'twas That grew the more by reaping .
To vail the title , as her mother doth .
No , no , no , no !
Even he , sir .
Serve God , love me , and mend .
With Cassio , mistress .
From me , whose love was of that dignity That it went hand in hand even with the vow I made to her in marriage , and to decline Upon a wretch whose natural gifts were poor To those of mine .
Welcome .
Is 't come to this ?
And as I wooed for thee to obtain her , I will join with thee to disgrace her .
Alas , I am the mother of these griefs .
You're fall'n into a princely hand .
Oh , couldst thou speak , That I might hear thee call great Caesar ass Unpolicied !
The mariners all under hatches stowed , Who , with a charm joined to their suffered labor , I have left asleep .
But for your private satisfaction , Because I love you , I will let you know .
Who ambles time withal ?
Nor must not then be yielded to in this .
Now , infidel , I have you on the hip .
She should have died hereafter .
Murder ?
His daughters seek his death .
I charge you , get you home .
Will not the mayor then and his brethren come ?
I follow him to serve my turn upon him .
If you like upon report The soil , the profit , and this kind of life , I will your very faithful feeder be And buy it with your gold right suddenly .
If you tickle us , do we not laugh ?
O Tranio , till I found it to be true , I never thought it possible or likely .
O wise and upright judge !
Shall 't be tonight at supper ?
I rather choose To wrong the dead , to wrong myself and you , Than I will wrong such honorable men .
Tie up my love's tongue .
O , then by day Where wilt thou find a cavern dark enough To mask thy monstrous visage ?
Do it , England , For like the hectic in my blood he rages , And thou must cure me .
Say not so , Agrippa .
Tis as arrant a piece of knavery , mark you now , as can be offert , in your conscience now , is it not ?
I pray you tell your brother how well I counterfeited .
Yet I have known those which have walked in their sleep who have died holily in their beds .
Strumpet , I come .
All may be well enough .
Let them play it .
Tis much he dares , And to that dauntless temper of his mind He hath a wisdom that doth guide his valor To act in safety .
Give me my armor .
If we do lose this battle , then is this The very last time we shall speak together .
Think upon Vaughan , and with guilty fear Let fall thy lance .
The prince my brother hath outgrown me far .
When shall we come to th ' top of that same hill ?
Return to her , and fifty men dismissed ?
Let that suffice you .
Get thee a wife , get thee a wife .
As the time , the place , and the condition of this country stands , I could heartily wish this had not befallen .
And whatsoever else shall hap tonight , Give it an understanding , but no tongue .
At a word , I am not .
He knows not what he says , and vain it is That we present us to him .
A simple countryman that brought her figs .
Carthage ?
Methinks it is like a weasel .
Speak to him .
The Lord Grandpre .
Thy eyes are almost set in thy head .
If it be love indeed , tell me how much .
What a thrice-double ass Was I , to take this drunkard for a god And worship this dull fool !
It is a man's office , but not yours .
And indeed it takes From our achievements , though performed at height , The pith and marrow of our attribute .
Call my guard , I prithee .
But it was , as I received it , and others , whose judgments in such matters cried in the top of mine , an excellent play , well digested in the scenes , set down with as much modesty as cunning .
There's a strong fellow , Menas .
Yet he hath ever but slenderly known himself .
You dare easier be friends with me than fight with mine enemy .
O perjured woman , thou dost stone my heart , And mak'st me call what I intend to do A murder , which I thought a sacrifice !
And what will you do now ?
I was the man i ' the moon when time was .
Swear by her foot , that she may tread out the oath .
True is it that we have seen better days And have with holy bell been knolled to church , And sat at good men's feasts and wiped our eyes Of drops that sacred pity hath engendered .
Ay , if a woman live to be a man .
He is most in the company of the right noble Claudio .
Come on , sir .
I'll tell you in your ear .
Then we are rid of Litio .
The people knows it , and have now received His accusations .
Wit shall not go unrewarded while I am king of this country .
Here .
Thus with imagined wing our swift scene flies In motion of no less celerity Than that of thought .
Do thou for him stand .
Well , your imprisonment shall not be long .
Ye gods , it doth amaze me A man of such a feeble temper should So get the start of the majestic world And bear the palm alone .
If any man doubt that , let him put me to my purgation .
Now know you , Casca , I have moved already Some certain of the noblest-minded Romans To undergo with me an enterprise Of honorable-dangerous consequence .
Dost thou affect her , Claudio ?
That's my noble master !
I fear you have sold your own lands to see other men's .
About a hoop of gold , a paltry ring That she did give me , whose posy was For all the world like cutler's poetry Upon a knife , "Love me and leave me not." What talk you of the posy or the value ?
I had rather break mine own .
What is the matter ?
I thank your Honor .
I think he will carry this island home in his pocket and give it his son for an apple .
I'll not answer that But say it is my humour .
The king hath note of all that they intend , By interception which they dream not of .
The watchdogs bark .
This letter from Bellario doth commend A young and learned doctor to our court .
If thou art she , tell me where is that son That floated with thee on the fatal raft ?
Stand back .
He waxes desperate with imagination .
So should a murderer look , so dead , so grim .
We'll see 'em starve first .
Else the Puck a liar call .
There's magic in the web of it .
And false .
Speak low if you speak love .
She dies for 't. , Eros , ho !
I will die bravely , like a smug bridegroom .
We shall further think on 't .
I do not find that thou deal'st justly with me .
Hie therefore , Robin , overcast the night .
Good sister , let us dine and never fret .
It is the prince of palfreys .
Nay , that you shall not .
My father's spirit in arms .
Tis mightiest in the mightiest .
Kent , father , sisters !
Thou hadst , and more , Miranda .
Would I were assured Of my condition .
When are you married , madam ?
Lo you , here she comes .
And I , delivering you , am satisfied , And therein do account myself well paid .
Which is the villain ?
Mistress , Wilt thou still talk ?
He that stirs next to carve for his own rage Holds his soul light , he dies upon his motion .
Shall they hoist me up And show me to the shouting varletry Of censuring Rome ?
What is he that you ask for , niece ?
O , that thou wert not , poor distressed soul !
Why , thy horn is a foot , and so long am I , at the least .
Now heaven help him !
Yea , leave that labor to great Hercules , And let it be more than Alcides ' twelve .
Come , gentlemen , let's go .
A pound of man's flesh taken from a man Is not so estimable , profitable neither , As flesh of muttons , beefs , or goats .
Age , thou art shamed !
Since he hath got the jewel that I loved , And that which you did swear to keep for me , I will become as liberal as you .
Murder !
Up , up , and see The great doom's image !
Was it not yesterday we spoke together ?
Who can control his fate ?
Use me but as your spaniel , spurn me , strike me , Neglect me , lose me .
My lord , I have remembrances of yours That I have longed long to redeliver .
My soul is heavy , and I fain would sleep .
We first address towards you , who with this king Hath rivaled for our daughter .
Heart , once be stronger than thy continent .
Then be 't so , my good lord. , How does the king ?
I am sorry I beat thee .
This is not yet an Alexandrian feast .
Never hung poison on a fouler toad .
My lord , your nobles , jealous of your absence , Seek through your camp to find you .
I hold your dainties cheap , sir , and your welcome dear .
Speak the speech , I pray you , as I pronounced it to you , trippingly on the tongue .
Am I Dromio ?
At thy request , monster , I will do reason , any reason. , Come on , Trinculo , let us sing .
I am glad on 't .
Let good Antonio look he keep his day , Or he shall pay for this .
My lord , I shall reply amazedly , Half sleep , half waking .
Do you put tricks upon 's with savages and men of Ind , ha ?
Tis dangerous to be spoken .
Dissemble not your hatred .
I found it in my chamber , And he himself confessed but even now That there he dropped it for a special purpose Which wrought to his desire .
Were I my father , coz , would I do this ?
Tis not a time for private stomaching .
Sit , sir .
When I spoke that , I was ill-tempered too .
That she was false to wedlock ?
Cassio knows you not .
Art thou of Cornish crew ?
Mean you to enjoy him then ?
How now ?
It shall be so .
Ay , my good lord .
They will steal anything and call it purchase .
Art thou so hasty ?
There is no more but so .
I say I will make him eat some part of my leek , or I will peat his pate four days. , Bite , I pray you .
Well , sir ?
Beshrew me , if I would do such a wrong For the whole world .
Why , now , blow wind , swell billow , and swim bark !
And for his dreams , I wonder he's so simple To trust the mock'ry of unquiet slumbers .
If I could bid the fifth welcome with so good a heart as I can bid the other four farewell , I should be glad of his approach .
So doth the greater glory dim the less .
Now all labor Mars what it does .
Be ruled .
A very handsome man .
My lord .
Claudio !
It is twice blessed : It blesseth him that gives and him that takes .
Good morrow , Brutus .
Give him this letter .
No man that's born of woman Shall e'er have power upon thee." Then fly , false thanes , And mingle with the English epicures .
I only speak right on .
Patience unmoved !
Is it a custom ?
Well , my good lord , I have informed them so .
His daughter is to be brought by you to the supper .
If you have poison for me , I will drink it .
Get thee to a nunnery .
But here comes Antony. , Welcome , Mark Antony .
Name the day of marriage , and God give thee joy .
Your loves , as mine to you .
We will go together .
O heavens , that such companions thou'dst unfold , And put in every honest hand a whip To lash the rascals naked through the world Even from the east to th ' west !
Not a drop before .
Rescue , fair lord , or else the day is lost !
Is it so brave a lass ?
I should ev'n die with pity To see another thus .
Be quiet , people .
But he that will believe all that they say shall never be saved by half that they do .
Can you smell him out by that ?
Am I in earth , in heaven , or in hell ?
Show me which way .
Hear a little further And then I'll bring thee to the present business Which now 's upon 's , without the which this story Were most impertinent .
What say you to a piece of beef and mustard ?
This a good block .
Kind Tyrrel , am I happy in thy news ?
Where is my gracious lord of Canterbury ?
But I do think it is their husbands ' faults If wives do fall .
And will you rent our ancient love asunder To join with men in scorning your poor friend ?
But that my Lady Beatrice should know me , and not know me !
Hamlet , thou art slain .
Are you content to stay ?
My father's death , Thy life hath it dishonored .
Shall we sound him ?
Yet do I not use my horse for my mistress , or any such proverb so little kin to the purpose .
Foolish wench , To th ' most of men this is a Caliban And they to him are angels .
He says for Brutus ' sake He finds himself beholding to us all .
There's my key .
What trade , thou knave ?
Fare thee well .
Who comes with him ?
It ripens towards it .
Your Grace is too costly to wear every day .
She was of Carthage , not of Tunis .
What , wouldst thou have a serpent sting thee twice ?
Where had he wine ?
As long as heaven and nature lengthens it .
Give me some light , away !
Yet this I will not do , do how I can .
But , my good lord , your Graces ' words shall serve As well as I had seen and heard him speak ; And do not doubt , right noble princes both , But I'll acquaint our duteous citizens With all your just proceedings in this case .
Approach thou like the rugged Russian bear , The armed rhinoceros , or th ' Hyrcan tiger ; Take any shape but that , and my firm nerves Shall never tremble .
Your servants tend .
Oh , the more angel she , And you the blacker devil !
I pray you tell Benedick of it and hear what he will say .
And yet no matter .
There were none fine but Adam , Rafe , and Gregory .
Amen .
Canidius and the rest That fell away have entertainment but No honorable trust .
Why did he so ?
Demand .
That's mercy , but too much security .
Cry mercy , lords and watchful gentlemen , That you have ta'en a tardy sluggard here .
Answer me directly .
Why should he follow ?
Go in , and weep not .
Surely I do believe your fair cousin is wronged .
Had I as many mouths as Hydra , such an answer would stop them all .
And Launcelot , soon at supper shalt thou see Lorenzo , who is thy new master's guest .
How now , Lord Stanley , what's the news ?
We are two lions littered in one day , And I the elder and more terrible .
How poor are they that have not patience !
You sulfurous and thought-executing fires , Vaunt-couriers of oak-cleaving thunderbolts , Singe my white head !
How fares your grace ?
Then your hose should be ungartered , your bonnet unbanded , your sleeve unbuttoned , your shoe untied , and everything about you demonstrating a careless desolation .
Nay , you were better speak first , and when you were graveled for lack of matter , you might take occasion to kiss .
Mere prattle without practice Is all his soldiership .
Prison , my lord ?
Why then , your ambition makes it one .
Sound , music ! , Come , my queen , take hands with me , And rock the ground whereon these sleepers be .
These couchings and these lowly courtesies Might fire the blood of ordinary men And turn preordinance and first decree Into the law of children .
I think it doth .
Ready , so please your grace .
Hard , hard. , O filthy traitor !
How "wear the garland" ?
No .
But dead they are , and devilish slave , by thee .
Shall I do such a deed ?
My sister may receive it much more worse To have her gentleman abused , assaulted For following her affairs. , Put in his legs .
Come , good Athenian .
I am not treacherous .
But the rarity of it is , which is indeed almost beyond credit , As many vouched rarities are .
I did hear him groan , Ay , and that tongue of his that bade the Romans Mark him and write his speeches in their books , "Alas , " it cried , "give me some drink , Titinius , " As a sick girl .
The sister to my wife , this gentlewoman , Thy son by this hath married .

Now counterfeit to swoon , why , now fall down ; Or if thou canst not , Oh , for shame , for shame , Lie not , to say mine eyes are murderers .
Sir , sir , that can not be .
Tell us what hath chanced today That Caesar looks so sad .
How can that be , when you have the voice of the king himself for your succession in Denmark ?

She can not love Nor take no shape nor project of affection She is so self-endeared .
I am called .
Now , beshrew my father's ambition !

What ?
That "fair" again unsay .
Tis a match .

A credulous father , and a brother noble , Whose nature is so far from doing harms That he suspects none , on whose foolish honesty My practices ride easy .

We know what belongs to a watch .
O Caesar !

This will I also wear in my cap .

Now Edmund , where's the villain ?
Prepare the body then , and follow us .
Come .
Ay , indeed !
Therein our letters do not well agree .
Come now , what masques , what dances shall we have To wear away this long age of three hours Between our after-supper and bedtime ?
My noble brother !
Let them set on at once , for I perceive But cold demeanor in Octavius ' wing , And sudden push gives them the overthrow .
I would she had bestowed this dotage on me .
Look , sir , I bleed .
My falcon now is sharp and passing empty , And , till she stoop , she must not be full-gorged , For then she never looks upon her lure .

And you , good sir .
Ay , sir , I thank God .
I have brought you from Venice .
Oh , my heart bleeds To think o ' th ' teen that I have turned you to , Which is from my remembrance !
Mark me .
Hie you to horse .
Wilt thou , Silvius ?
Not that I love you not .
From helmet to the spur , all blood he was .
Most shallow man .
Why then , the mustard without the beef .
If thou dost find him tractable to us , Encourage him and show him all our reasons .
More of this matter can not I report .
Bear thee well in it and leave us alone .

Seek him , Titinius , whilst I go to meet The noble Brutus , thrusting this report Into his ears .
Will you two help to hasten them ?
I do beseech your Grace to pardon me , and withal Forbear your conference with the noble duke .

Did not her kitchen maid rail , taunt , and scorn me ?
A beast , no more .
Dissolve , thick cloud , and rain , that I may say The gods themselves do weep !

Go get it ready .
Return with her ?
He is the brooch indeed And gem of all the nation .
Let me not burst in ignorance , but tell Why thy canonized bones , hearsed in death , Have burst their cerements ; why the sepulcher ,
Away , away , be gone .
So please you , What says the fellow there ?
The one I'll stay , the other stayeth me .
It provokes the desire , but it takes away the performance .
No wonder , sir , But certainly a maid .
What wouldst thou do , old man ?
Poor Tom's a-cold .
Well , do it , and be brief .
What dogs are these !
Fine , i ' faith !
Shall we give o'er and drown ?
Open your gates .
Come , Friar Francis , be brief , only to the plain form of marriage , and you shall recount their particular duties afterwards .

And you by land .
He hath been out nine years , and away he shall again .
What , of death too , That rids our dogs of languish ?
And speak parrot ?
Hero thinks surely she will die , for she says she will die if he love her not , and she will die ere she make her love known , and she will die if he woo her rather than she will bate one breath of her accustomed crossness .
Come , instance .
Their great guilt , Like poison given to work a great time after , Now 'gins to bite the spirits .
Which do not be entreated to , but weigh What it is worth embraced .
In the same figure like the king that's dead .
Thy garments are not spotted with our blood , Nor thou within the compass of my curse .
I do not understand .
Where is the fellow ?
Let it go all .
When he stands where I am and sees you there .
Hear me , recreant !
We can not call her winds and waters sighs and tears .
If you say , I hope you will not kill me .
And so , my lord , adieu .
Good morrow , masters .
True .
So quick bright things come to confusion .
Richard !
Think , my lord ? " Alas , thou echo'st me As if there were some monster in thy thought Too hideous to be shown .
At Sardis once , And this last night here in Philippi fields .
Let me stay the growth of his beard , if thou delay me not the knowledge of his chin .
You shall have leave .
O , 'tis a parlous boy , Bold , quick , ingenious , forward , capable .
You love me not .
Tell us where 'tis , that we may take it thence And bear it to the chapel .
Friends am I with you all and love you all Upon this hope : that you shall give me reasons Why and wherein Caesar was dangerous .
A fox when one has caught her And such a daughter Should sure to the slaughter , If my cap would buy a halter .
This is the very ecstasy of love , Whose violent property fordoes itself And leads the will to desperate undertakings As oft as any passion under heaven That does afflict our natures .
Indeed , they are disproportioned .
Yea , and the best person too .
I pause for a reply .
And I another .
May she give that ?
That's a perilous shot out of an elder gun , that a poor and private displeasure can do against a monarch .
Give me your hand .
Come , come , we know your meaning , brother Gloucester .
My very hairs do mutiny , for the white Reprove the brown for rashness , and they them For fear and doting .
Bring him before us .
But , sirrah , you shall buy this sport as dear As all the metal in your shop will answer .
You are a merry man , sir .
As thick as tale Can post with post , and every one did bear Thy praises in his kingdom's great defense , And poured them down before him .
I am poisoned .
And so , with no money at all and a little more wit , return again to Venice .
The Count Claudio shall marry the daughter of Leonato .
How now , sir ?
Avaunt !
Faith , her privates we .
Come , sirs .
Save you , friend Cassio !
If sanctimony and a frail vow betwixt an erring barbarian and supersubtle Venetian be not too hard for my wits and all the tribe of hell , thou shalt enjoy her .
My dearest love , Duncan comes here tonight .
Nor I neither , by this heavenly light .
No , madam .
I would not change this hue Except to steal your thoughts , my gentle queen .
At first And last , the hearty welcome .
It may well be called Jove's tree when it drops forth such fruit .
Good Ursula , wake my cousin Beatrice and desire her to rise .
Give me leave. , I am a gentleman of Verona , sir , That hearing of her beauty and her wit , Her affability and bashful modesty , Her wondrous qualities and mild behavior , Am bold to show myself a forward guest Within your house , to make mine eye the witness Of that report which I so oft have heard .
I have perceived a most faint neglect of late , which I have rather blamed as mine own jealous curiosity than as a very pretense and purpose of unkindness .
Had not that been as proper ?
Nay , I am sure it is , Volumnius .
Yond island carrions , desperate of their bones , Ill-favoredly become the morning field .
It is no matter .
How fondly dost thou reason !
But she perforce withholds the loved boy , Crowns him with flowers , and makes him all her joy .
Here's his dry hand up and down .
Here , my lord .
Oh , is that all ?
Some haste , my lord !
Jailer , look to him .
How know you he loves her ?
Now I feed myself With most delicious poison .
Well , Syracusian , say in brief the cause Why thou dep-artedst from thy native home And for what cause thou camest to Ephesus .
That did I , my lord , and was accounted a good actor .
There will we rehearse , for if we meet in the city we shall be dogged with company , and our devices known .
When they are gone , then must I count my gains .
O my dear lord , Nay , do not think I flatter .
But where's my fool ?
Better it were they all came by his father , Or by the father there were none at all , For emulation who shall now be nearest Will touch us all too near if God prevent not .
Therefore the moon , the governess of floods , Pale in her anger , washes all the air , That rheumatic diseases do abound .
Come , wait upon him .
Farewell .
Sweet now , silence .
Villain , thou know'st not law of God nor man .
Heigh-ho .
Thrice within this hour I saw him down , thrice up again and fighting .
And , good boy , good night .
Would I were satisfied !
Thou wilt write to Antony ?
Neither to you nor any one , having no witness to confirm my speech .
Even so .
For what had he to do to chide at me ?
Help , ho !
I speak not to disprove what Brutus spoke , But here I am to speak what I do know .
What's your will ?
Why should not we Be there in person ?
Oh , that my prayers could such affection move !
What man was he talked with you yesternight Out at your window betwixt twelve and one ?
And all the faith , the virtue of my heart , The object and the pleasure of mine eye , Is only Helena .
Yet it was said It should not stand in thy posterity , But that myself should be the root and father Of many kings .
The like is on her arm .
Cleopatra , catching but the least noise of this , dies instantly .
Because that , like a jack , thou keep'st the stroke Betwixt thy begging and my meditation .
If he do fear God , he must necessarily keep peace .
Oh that I knew this husband , which , you say , must charge his horns with garlands !
The duke must grant me that .
My lady charged my duty in this business .
Use them after your own honor and dignity .
Hold you , there is a groat to heal your pate .
Peace , ho !
A good man's fortune may grow out at heels .
Go , good partner , go , get you to Francis Seacole .
Signior Leonato , let the friar advise you .
She is damned for it .
Come hither , Catesby .
Sure , I shall never marry like my sisters , To love my father all .
Well , sir , I thank you .
But goes thy heart with this ?
Nay , it is .
They are winged .
O my good master !
You slave , you cur !
I am content , so the maiden cities you talk of may wait on her .
Where's the Master ?
What men daily do , not knowing what they do !
You are very well met .
Thy currish spirit Governed a wolf who , hanged for human slaughter , Even from the gallows did his fell soul fleet , And whilst thou layest in thy unhallowed dam Infused itself in thee , for thy desires Are wolvish , bloody , starved , and ravenous .
Good sir , this ring was given me by my wife .
I will o'ertake thee , Cleopatra , and Weep for my pardon .
Not i ' th ' stocks , fool .
I wear it for a memorable honor , For I am Welsh , you know , good countryman .
Let it appear so .
Cousins , I hope the days are near at hand That chambers will be safe .
I know you .
One of them rates All that is won and lost .
Your vessels and your spells provide , Your charms and everything beside .
If you shall send them word you will not come , Their minds may change .
What , have you writ that letter to my sister ?
So dear I loved the man that I must weep .
Lie , With her ?
I'll read the writing .
Or like a whale .
Good morrow , worthy Caesar .
I'll not budge an inch , boy .
He is returned .
A stone-cutter or painter could not have made him so ill though they had been but two years o ' th ' trade .
We will have no telling .
I do but stay till your marriage be consummate , and then go I toward Aragon .
Brief let me be .
Wrong I mine enemies ?
But I pray you , who is his companion ?
Shylock , albeit I neither lend nor borrow By taking nor by giving of excess , Yet to supply the ripe wants of my friend , I'll break a custom .
Are you he ?
We'll speak with thee at sea .
What is the time o ' th ' day ?
I have so often blushed to acknowledge him that now I am brazed to it .
To thee I do commend my watchful soul , Ere I let fall the windows of mine eyes .
Go seek him out , speak fair , and bring the body Into the chapel .
And , good lieutenant , I think you think I love you .
And so farewell. , Katherina , you may stay , For I have more to commune with Bianca .
We'll answer .
Tis so .
You hear the suit .
Small cheer and great welcome makes a merry feast .
They'll kill us .
What sayest thou ?
Oh , by whom ?
Do as I bid thee .
Why then , alas , Do I put up that womanly defense , To say I have done no harm ?
We will ourselves provide .
Or neither ?
What , sir , not yet at rest ?
This is an aspic's trail , and these fig leaves Have slime upon them , such as th' aspic leaves Upon the caves of Nile .
If thou takest more Or less than a just pound , be it but so much As makes it light or heavy in the substance Or the division of the twentieth part Of one poor scruple , nay , if the scale do turn But in the estimation of a hair , Thou diest and all thy goods are confiscate .
Feel you your legs ?
No jutty , frieze , Buttress , nor coign of vantage , but this bird Hath made his pendant bed and procreant cradle .
Tis true indeed , so your daughter says .
Neither , my lord .
Was he not here ?
Is it not Hero ?
Come , Menas .
What does this mean , my lord ?
What men may do !
And have you mercy too !
Tis much. , Servants , leave me and her alone .
Repair thy wit , good youth , or it will fall To cureless ruin .
One from the Lord Stanley .
I will be angry .
I will be correspondent to command And do my spiriting gently .
Nay , I beseech you , sir , be not out with me .
Come , Grey .
Pardon , master .
No , no , the bell .
Thou hast forspoke my being in these wars And sayst it is not fit .
Why , look you how you storm !
Marry , sir , they have committed false report ; moreover , they have spoken untruths ; secondarily , they are slanders ; sixth and lastly , they have belied a lady ; thirdly , they have verified unjust things ; and , to conclude , they are lying knaves .
Nor I neither .
Sinful Macduff , They were all struck for thee !
Everyone hears that That can distinguish sound .
What did thy song bode , lady ?
Is it within reason and compass ?
And , in conclusion , she shall watch all night , And if she chance to nod I'll rail and brawl , And with the clamor keep her still awake .
Well , daughter , and you gentlewomen all , Withdraw into a chamber by yourselves , And when I send for you , come hither masked .
I am glad to see you mad .
What say you , Hermia ?
All is not well .
We'll burn the house of Brutus .
After her , after her .
I will , my lord .
What's that to thee ?
Know you before whom , sir ?
The violet smells to him as it doth to me .
He shall spurn fate , scorn death , and bear His hopes 'bove wisdom , grace , and fear .
Room !
Draw , you rogue , for though it be night yet the moon shines .
For me , with sorrow I embrace my fortune .
An unauthorized kiss !
I pray you , give me leave to go from hence .
He hath refused it in the open court .
Tonight I'll mourn with Hero .
I can not hope Caesar and Antony shall well greet together .
Did this in Caesar seem ambitious ?
Regan , I have good hope Thou didst not know on 't. , Who comes here ?
Dear sir , forbear !
And , as thou badest me , In troops I have dispersed them 'bout the isle .
I deny it not .
That done , repair to Pompey's theatre .
I beseech your pardon .
What's the boy Malcolm ?
You will have Gremio to keep you fair .
Ha , ha , heard in Genoa .
He's in Arthur's bosom , if ever man went to Arthur's bosom .
No slander .
Your reason ?
My noble girls !
Why ,
Trail'st thou the puissant pike ?
Is that the naked fellow ?
Let's meet as little as we can .
Tis done by me , and ends in "Margaret." Thus have you breathed your curse against yourself .
It shall not need .
Right well , dear madam .
Count the clock .
Good love , call him back .
Thence we looked toward England And cited up a thousand fearful times , During the wars of York and Lancaster That had befall'n us .
Oh , ay , as summer flies are in the shambles , That quicken even with blowing .
What , and my old Venetian friend Salerio ?
I am tied to th ' stake , and I must stand the course .
Only this commendation I can afford her , that were she other than she is , she were unhandsome , and being no other but as she is , I do not like her .
I loved you ever .
What , is he dead ?
Confined together In the same fashion as you gave in charge , Just as you left them , all prisoners , sir , In the line grove which weather-fends your cell .
Aroint thee , witch ! " the rump-fed runnion cries .
But did'st thou see them dead ?
Art thou there , Diomed ?
I have sent for these strawberries .
Well , I conceive .
As wit and fortune will .
In the most high and palmy state of Rome , A little ere the mightiest Julius fell , The graves stood tenantless and the sheeted dead Did squeak and gibber in the Roman streets As stars with trains of fire and dews of blood , Disasters in the sun , and the moist star Upon whose influence Neptune's empire stands Was sick almost to doomsday with eclipse .
What's the matter ?
Because , look you , you do not love it , nor your affections and your appetites and your digestions does not agree with it , I would desire you to eat it .
Who stays it still withal ?
What a life is this That your poor friends must woo your company ?
She hath spied him already with those sweet eyes .
God be wi ' you , sir .
In pity of the challenger's youth , I would fain dissuade him , but he will not be entreated .
How now , general ?
Let us see .
Ere I would say I would drown myself for the love of a guinea hen , I would change my humanity with a baboon .
I know not what you mean by that , but I am sure Caesar fell down .
Nor doth this wood lack worlds of company , For you in my respect are all the world .
Is not this man jealous ?
O , if thou be'st the same Egeon , speak , And speak unto the same Emilia .
Thus high , by thy advice And thy assistance is King Richard seated .
Ratcliffe , my lord , 'tis I .
But when we in our viciousness grow hard , Oh , misery on 't ! , the wise gods seel our eyes , In our own filth drop our clear judgments , make us Adore our errors , laugh at 's while we strut To our confusion .
Hark , come hither , Tyrrel .
Ay , sir .
Well contented .
Yet would not so have been , Durst I have done my will .
I shall entreat him To answer like himself .
Do not talk to me , Emilia .
The more my prayer , the lesser is my grace .
Now attest That those whom you called fathers did beget you .
Thy loving father , Hamlet .
Hark !
Could beauty , my lord , have better commerce than with honesty ?
I have done my work ill , friends .
The town is beseeched , and the trumpet call us to the breach , and we talk and , be Chrish , do nothing , 'tis shame for us all .
Of a snail ?
There's a bargain made .
Peace !
He doth entreat your Grace , my noble lord , To visit him tomorrow or next day .
Verona , for a while I take my leave , To see my friends in Padua , but of all My best beloved and approved friend , Hortensio .
Nay , but this dotage of our general's O'erflows the measure .
Which be the malefactors ?
I am his brother , and I love him well .
No , faith , my coz , wish not a man from England .
Have you that holy feeling in your souls To counsel me to make my peace with God , And art you yet to your own souls so blind That thou will war with God by murd'ring me ?
Spake you of Caesar ?
I wish , forbear .
Sister , you'll go with us ?
I am hers .
But were I not the better part made mercy , I should not seek an absent argument Of my revenge , thou present .
We judge no less. , Uncle of Exeter , Enlarge the man committed yesterday That railed against our person .
How now ?
When the wind is southerly , I know a hawk from a handsaw .
This found I on my tent this morning .
I alone will go .
Do not , Phoebe .
That's most certain , and with you .
It was about to speak when the cock crew .
Who builds his hopes in air of your good looks Lives like a drunken sailor on a mast , Ready with every nod to tumble down Into the fatal bowels of the deep .
And thence from Athens turn away our eyes To seek new friends and stranger companies .
But , sith I am entered in this cause so far , Pricked to 't by foolish honesty and love , I will go on .
Do Poor Tom some charity , whom the foul fiend vexes .
Stir with the lark tomorrow , gentle Norfolk .
Carry him gently to my fairest chamber And hang it round with all my wanton pictures .
I do so , I confess it .
Welcome .
Blessed pudding !
He is not doubted. , A word , Lucillius .
I long to hear him call the drunkard "husband , " And how my men will stay themselves from laughter When they do homage to this simple peasant .
Then , in the name of God and all these rights , Advance your standards .
Truly , young gentlemen , though there was no great matter in the ditty , yet the note was very untunable .
Cool it with a baboon's blood , Then the charm is firm and good .
What was he that you followed with your sword ?
We had like to have had our two noses snapped off with two old men without teeth .
Reputation , reputation , reputation !
I will do so .
I have done my duty .
Your friends at Pomfret , they do need the priest ; Your Honor hath no shriving work in hand .
Let me question more in particular .
Thou shalt serve me .
The hour of death is expiate .
Do you know him ?
When was it she last walked ?
Seek thine own ease .
What is amiss ?
O villainy !
I would my daughter were dead at my foot and the jewels in her ear !
Bear with my weakness .
I shall desire you of more acquaintance , good Master Cobweb .
Look in my face .
Alas , good gentleman !
But as all is mortal in nature , so is all nature in love mortal in folly .
Stand you both forth now : stroke your chins and swear by your beards that I am a knave .
I prithee , good Grumio , tell me , how goes the world ?
I can suck melancholy out of a song as a weasel sucks eggs .
His company must do his minions grace , Whilst I at home starve for a merry look .
Wert thou not banished on pain of death ?
But if it were , doubt not her care should be To comb your noddle with a three-legged stool And paint your face and use you like a fool .
It's suppertime , my lord .
Thou didst usurp my place , and dost thou not Usurp the just proportion of my sorrow ?
Take each man's censure but reserve thy judgment .
The reason that I gather he is mad , Besides this present instance of his rage , Is a mad tale he told today at dinner Of his own doors being shut against his entrance .
I prithee , put them off .
Then there is the County Palatine .
Lead the way .
Yea , marry , that's the eftest way. , Let the watch come forth .
I hope so .
You should ask me what time o ' day .
Octavia is of a holy , cold , and still conversation .
The mayor is here at hand .
We doubt not of a fair and lucky war , Since God so graciously hath brought to light This dangerous treason lurking in our way To hinder our beginnings .
Therefore our everlasting farewell take .
But you are no such man .
To both their deaths shalt thou be accessory .
I'll have grounds More relative than this .
And there the snake throws her enameled skin , Weed wide enough to wrap a fairy in .
Now , Signior , what news ?
I feel this pinprick .
We being strangers here , how dar'st thou trust So great a charge from thine own custody ?
Well then , if ever I thank any man , I'll thank you .
What's Antony ?
He that has the two fair daughters , is 't he you mean ?
Why do you cross me in this exigent ?
Plucks off my beard and blows it in my face ?
Is it come to this ?
The king is not to answer it .
Is my lord angry ?
Go seek the traitor Gloucester .
What was thy cause ?
Signor Benedick !
Our expectation hath this day an end .
How is 't ?
We defy augury .
There be some such , no question .
If it be not for some purpose of import , Give 't me again .
My lord is dead .
He would not take the crown .
That I did for him .
Five shillings to one on 't , with any man that knows the statutes , he may stay him , marry , not without the Prince be willing , for indeed the watch ought to offend no man , and it is an offense to stay a man against his will .
The heavens forbid But that our loves and comforts should increase , Even as our days do grow .
Come , will you go with me ?
Then , God grant me too Thou mayst be damned for that wicked deed .
No , my lord , unless I might have another for working days .
Why didst thou send me forth , brave Cassius ?
Full oft 'tis seen , Our means secure us and our mere defects Prove our commodities .
God bless your Grace with health and happy days .
I know into what straits of fortune she is driven , and it is not impossible to me , if it appear not inconvenient to you , to set her before your eyes tomorrow , human as she is , and without any danger .
I will follow .
Why ?
You may do then in time .
Do you not remember , lady , in your father's time a Venetian , a scholar and a soldier , that came hither in company of the Marquess of Montferrat ?
Go .
Come your ways .
I would have sworn it had , my lord , especially against Benedick .
She's the worse for all this .
But yet I'll make assurance double sure , And take a bond of fate .
He will to his Egyptian dish again .
A thousand , sir , Early though 't be , have on their riveted trim And at the port expect you .
Nay , we will slink away in supper time , Disguise us at my lodging , and return , All in an hour .
And even for that do I love you the more .
For me , the gold of France did not seduce , Although I did admit it as a motive The sooner to effect what I intended ; But God be thanked for prevention , Which I in sufferance heartily will rejoice , Beseeching God and you to pardon me .
That way the noise is .
Go and tell them so .
I have no way , and therefore want no eyes .
Goodly Lord , what a wit-snapper are you !
Yes , madam , he was of that consort .
Sir , in my heart there was a kind of fighting That would not let me sleep .
Who's there ?
I was told that by one that knows him better than you .
So was I when your Highness banished him .
Ha , ha , ha !
There is no other way , Unless thou couldst put on some other shape And not be Richard , that hath done all this .
Art rich ?
I have heard of your paintings too , well enough .
No , my fair cousin .
I am your neighbor , and was suitor first .
Come , come .
Good night , but go not to mine uncle's bed .
Know you not he has ?
And when she weeps , weeps every little flower , Lamenting some enforced chastity .
Fiery" ?
By Dromio ?
Talk not , Signior Gremio .
Give me thy hand , Messala .
I take my leave of you .
I am glad to see your Honor .
I would my father looked but with my eyes .
Poor prattler , how thou talk'st !
Why , madam , if I were your father's dog , You should not use me so .
But I will wed thee in another key , With pomp , with triumph , and with reveling .
Le Roy ?
For besides these beneficial news , it is the celebration of his nuptial .
As the ox hath his bow , sir , the horse his curb , and the falcon her bells , so man hath his desires ; and as pigeons bill , so wedlock would be nibbling .
Look to her , Moor , if thou hast eyes to see .
Do you think I meant country matters ?
Here's neither bush nor shrub to bear off any weather at all .
Why , there's no remedy .
Were you made the messenger ?
I know the boy will well usurp the grace , Voice , gait , and action of a gentlewoman .
I eat the air , promise-crammed .
Where's thy drum ?
God keep your Lordship in that gracious mind .
I will not sup tonight .
I pray you , father , being weak , seem so .
Swear by my sword .
Dead , then ?
I think it be .
Follow his chariot , like the greatest spot Of all thy sex .
How say you by this change ?
Abate the edge of traitors , gracious Lord , That would reduce these bloody days again , And make poor England weep in streams of blood !
Kiss him for that , good widow .
And I do hope good days and long to see .
May one be pardoned and retain th ' offense ?
Old I do wax , and from my weary limbs Honor is cudgeled .
I have brought him a present .
I'll send my prayers with him .
Stephano is my name , and I bring word My mistress will before the break of day Be here at Belmont .
Yet I'll not shed her blood , Nor scar that whiter skin of hers than snow And smooth as monumental alabaster .
Go to .
Tranio hits you now .
Besides , our hands are hard .
Beware the ides of March .
A whole one , I .
Why , go to bed , and sleep .
A crow without feather ?
We must to the watch .
And all my children ?
We came crying hither .
Zounds , hold your peace .
Contemning Rome , he has done all this and more In Alexandria .
I serve you , madam .
But is all this for your father ?
Hear me , Beatrice , Talk with a man out at a window !
Why , then let's home again .
In which regard ,
I prithee , pretty youth , let me be better acquainted with thee .
Nothing but songs of death .
Oh , sweet England !
A tailor make a man ?
How ?
You mean , to bear me , not to bear with me. , Uncle , my brother mocks both you and me .
Have you any further trade with us ?
No , indeed , my lord .
I'll back to the duke of Gloucester and tell him so .
Why so ? , Ay , that way goes the game .
You pay him then .
No greater heart in thee ?
He saves my labor by his own approach .
Hear me , you wrangling pirates , that fall out In sharing that which you have pilled from me !
Gentle madam , no .
You have no stomach , Signior .
You can not , if my heart were in your hand , Nor shall not , whilst 'tis in my custody .
Therefore I say with noble Buckingham That it is meet so few should fetch the prince .
Hoppedance cries in Tom's belly for two white herring .
We will have more of this tomorrow .
What's your pleasure , sir ?
I will not leave him now till Cassio Be called to him. , How is 't with you , my lord ?
But what praise couldst thou bestow on a deserving woman indeed , one that in the authority of her merit did justly put on the vouch of very malice itself ?
That island of England breeds very valiant creatures .
Now let thy friendly hand Put strength enough to 't .
Take your time .
Then shall we be news-crammed .
Fulvia thy wife first came into the field .
In this time of the night ?
Let's follow it , and after do our work .
No , truly , for the truest poetry is the most feigning , and lovers are given to poetry , and what they swear in poetry may be said as lovers they do feign .
I will forget my nature .
What woman , then ?
She rendered life , Thy name so buried in her .
Shall I be plain ?
Why , do not your courtier's hands sweat ?
How came you thus recovered ?
There remain And fortify it strongly 'gainst the French .
I am sick in displeasure to him , and whatsoever comes athwart his affection ranges evenly with mine .
But truly , for mine own part , if I were as tedious as a king , I could find it in my heart to bestow it all of your worship .
If you pardon , we will mend .
Here in the tent .
I will make myself known to Desdemona .
Alas , poor hurt fowl , now will he creep into sedges .
Ay , you would beg , Were you in my distress .
Not for Cadwallader and all his goats .
No more , I pray thee .
Lady , shall I lie in your lap ?
Now sir , be judge yourself , Whether I in any just term am affined To love the Moor .
Most like .
Ay , that Petruchio came .
Cunning .
Never , Iago .
Did Michael Cassio , when you wooed my lady , Know of your love ?
For this pains Caesar hath hanged him .
Much will be seen in that .
A sibyl , that had numbered in the world The sun to course two hundred compasses , In her prophetic fury sewed the work .
The revelers are entering , brother .
No , to my cabin .
They call it Agincourt .
He brings you figs .
I would I were invisible , to catch the strong fellow by the leg .
Tomorrow then I will expect your coming .
If that same demon that hath gulled thee thus Should with his lion gait walk the whole world , He might return to vasty Tartar back And tell the legions "I can never win A soul so easy as that Englishman's." Oh , how hast thou with jealousy infected The sweetness of affiance !
This prophecy Merlin shall make , for I live before his time .
Stay , gentle Helena .
Away , go !
O , wilt thou darkling leave me ?
From both , my lord .
He is my dear friend , an please you .
Oh , temperance , lady !
Go to , farewell .
See what a rent the envious Casca made .
O , touch me not .
Your children shall be kings .
Say she be mute and will not speak a word ; Then I'll commend her volubility , And say she uttereth piercing eloquence .
Are you sure That we are awake ?
Not for thy fairy kingdom. , Fairies , away !
With an eye of green in 't .
Thus I conceive by him .
Then does he say he lent me Some shipping , unrestored .
I'll have my bond .
I thank you most for him .
I do remember me , Henry the Sixth Did prophesy that Richmond should be king , When Richmond was a little peevish boy .
Some of my shame , if you will know of me What man I am , and how , and why , and where This handkercher was stained .
It is here , Hamlet .
Fare thee well awhile .
Am I not stayed for , Cinna ?
And then the moon , like to a silver bow New bent in heaven , shall behold the night Of our solemnities .
These Moors are changeable in their wills , fill thy purse with money .
Not so , not so .
To cabin , silence !
I pray you , sir , hold your hand .
Royal wench !
Awake , awake !
By Hercules , I think I am i' th' right .
I'll go find a shadow and sigh till he come .
Good hay , sweet hay , hath no fellow .
Remember our reward when the deed's done .
O , gentlemen , see , see dead Henry's wounds Open their congealed mouths and bleed afresh ! , Blush , blush , thou lump of foul deformity , For 'tis thy presence that exhales this blood From cold and empty veins where no blood dwells .
Well too .
Marked you not How that the guilty kindred of the queen Looked pale when they did hear of Clarence ' death ?
That's certain .
I'll bring you thither , my lord , if you'll vouchsafe me .
See where she comes and brings your froward wives As prisoners to her womanly persuasion. , Katherine , that cap of yours becomes you not .
And , honest company , I thank you all , That have beheld me give away myself To this most patient , sweet and virtuous wife .
Poisoned , then .
Is that the chain you promised me today ?
Madam , so thrive I in my enterprise And dangerous success of bloody wars As I intend more good to you and yours Than ever you or yours were by me harmed !
Even a toy in hand here , sir .
There , my lord .
Pray , what do you think is his name ?
The trick of that voice I do well remember .
A charge we bear i' th' war , And as the president of my kingdom will Appear there for a man .
Ha !
This is the day which , in King Edward's time , I wished might fall on me when I was found False to his children and his wife's allies .
Or sleep I now and think I hear all this ?
Out of doubt he is transported .
The king is not bound to answer the particular endings of his soldiers , the father of his son , nor the master of his servant , for they purpose not their death , when they purpose their services .
Not we .
By this kind of chase I should hate him , for my father hated his father dearly .
Go , good Tubal .
Thou hast hit it .
Lady , you know no rules of charity , Which renders good for bad , blessings for curses .
Where we lay , Our chimneys were blown down and , as they say , Lamentings heard i ' th ' air , strange screams of death , And prophesying with accents terrible Of dire combustion and confused events New hatched to the woeful time .
Am I your man ?
Wilt thou know Th ' effect of what I wrote ?
I have not art to reckon my groans , but that I love thee best , oh , most best , believe it .
Go to , go to .
A heavy summons lies like lead upon me , And yet I would not sleep .
Hear you the news abroad ?
She told her , while she kept it 'Twould make her amiable and subdue my father Entirely to her love , but if she lost it Or made gift of it , my father's eye Should hold her loathed and his spirits should hunt After new fancies .
You understand me ?
Your worship speaks like a most thankful and reverent youth , and I praise God for you .
Kind sister , thanks .
I know thy quality .
Well , bawd I'll turn , And something lean to cutpurse of quick hand .
For we will fetters put upon this fear , Which now goes too free-footed .
Ay , madam , it is common .
Make all the money thou canst .
He's gone , but his wife's killed .
Let me love him for that , and do you love him because I do .
Well .
They would have me as familiar with men's pockets as their gloves or their handkerchers , which makes much against my manhood , if I should take from another's pocket to put into mine , for it is plain pocketing up of wrongs .
An if your wife be not a madwoman , And know how well I have deserved the ring , She would not hold out enemy forever For giving it to me .
The enemy , marching along by them , By them shall make a fuller number up , Come on refreshed , new-added , and encouraged , From which advantage shall we cut him off If at Philippi we do face him there , These people at our back .
To the seaside straightway !
Francis Flute , the bellows-mender ?
Why , the end is he hath lost a ship .
My name is Edgar , and thy father's son .
Shall we to th ' court ?
Nine or ten times I had thought t ' have yerked him here under the ribs .
Why , I pray you , is not "pig" great ?
Why came not the slave back to me when I called him .
I charge thee , hence , and do not haunt me thus .
Good !
Alas , my lord , Your wisdom is consumed in confidence .
Hearts , tongues , figures , scribes , bards , poets , can not Think , speak , cast , write , sing , number , hoo ! , His love to Antony .
The son is fled .
And to that place the sharp Athenian law Can not pursue us .
At my lodging .
Octavius , I have seen more days than you .
Too well , too well .
When shall we three meet again ?
Thou wast provoked by thy bloody mind , That never dream'st on aught but butcheries .
Richard yet lives , hell's black intelligencer , Only reserved their factor to buy souls And send them thither .
So please my lord the duke and all the court , To quit the fine for one half of his goods I am content , so he will let me have The other half in use to render it Upon his death unto the gentleman That lately stole his daughter .
I shall find time , Cassius , I shall find time .
They say he parted well and paid his score .
You keep by land The legions and the horse whole , do you not ?
Tis a wild night .
Tell me .
O , thou didst prophesy the time would come That I should wish for thee to help me curse That bottled spider , that foul bunch-backed toad !
Yet I hate not Orlando .
Kill !
No , but the barber's man hath been seen with him , and the old ornament of his cheek hath already stuffed tennis balls .
But let that go .
You shall be more beloving than beloved .
And may , through all the world !
But few of any sort , and none of name .
Two or three groan .
Here , take away this dish .
Signior Hortensio , 'twixt such friends as we Few words suffice .
I must needs report the truth .
Godden to your Worship , good Captain James .
Judge me , you gods !
Assuredly the thing is to be sold .
You have loved him well .
Even for the blood That then I lost for thee , now grant me justice .
By my troth , I am sick .
O masters , if I were disposed to stir Your hearts and minds to mutiny and rage , I should do Brutus wrong , and Cassius wrong , Who , you all know , are honorable men .
I can not bid you bid my daughter live , That were impossible , but , I pray you both , Possess the people in Messina here How innocent she died .
Bring me word how tall she is .
Do you not hear me speak ?
Peace , ho !
Basting .
Say "a day" without the "ever." No , no , Orlando , men are April when they woo , December when they wed. Maids are May when they are maids , but the sky changes when they are wives .
This pernicious slave , Forsooth , took on him as a conjurer , And , gazing in mine eyes , feeling my pulse ,
I greet thy love Not with vain thanks but with acceptance bounteous , And will upon the instant put thee to 't .
World , world , O world !
Bring him with triumph home unto his house !
When last I was at Exeter , The mayor in courtesy showed me the castle And called it Rougemont , at which name I started , Because a bard of Ireland told me once I should not live long after I saw Richmond .
This is nothing , Fool .
Stands Scotland where it did ?
The door is open , sir .
You are deceived .
I know not at whose suit he is arrested well , But he's in a suit of buff which 'rested him ; that can I tell .
Here , sirrah Grumio .
I hourly learn A doctrine of obedience , and would gladly Look him i' th' face .
Tis three o'clock , and , Romans , yet ere night We shall try fortune in a second fight .
You always end with a jade's trick .
He speaks to me. , I am your master , Dromio .
Tempt him not so too far .
In thee there is not half an hour of life .
Indeed ?
Then be thou jocund .
Twas yet some comfort When misery could beguile the tyrant's rage And frustrate his proud will .
No cock of mine .
But do not stain The even virtue of our enterprise , Nor th ' insuppressive mettle of our spirits , To think that or our cause or our performance Did need an oath , when every drop of blood That every Roman bears , and nobly bears , Is guilty of a several bastardy If he do break the smallest particle Of any promise that hath passed from him .
The concernancy , sir ?
I see thy age and dangers make thee dote .
Stand from the hearse .
Give him no breath , but now Make boot of his distraction .
You come not Like Caesar's sister .
Tomorrow I intend to hunt again .
A daughter ?
Thou art as wise as thou art beautiful .
Learn it , learn it , marquess .
I think our father will hence tonight .
By heaven , that should be my handkerchief !
And that distilled by magic sleights Shall raise such artificial sprites As by the strength of their illusion Shall draw him on to his confusion .
Welcome .
It would become me As well as it does you , and I should do it With much more ease , for my good will is to it And yours it is against .
Is this the noble Moor whom our full senate Call all in all sufficient ?
I humbly thank you for't .
I think so too .
And here's another , Writ in my cousin's hand , stol'n from her pocket , Containing her affection unto Benedick .
One side will mock another , th ' other too .
There are more things in heaven and earth , Horatio , Than are dreamt of in your philosophy .
As I !
I should first tell thee how the Prince , Claudio and my master , planted and placed and possessed by my master Don John , saw afar off in the orchard this amiable encounter .
Awake !
Then I salute you with this royal title : Long live Richard , England's worthy king !
How have you known the miseries of your father ?
Peace !
Why , he that cuts off twenty years of life Cuts off so many years of fearing death .
Adieu , noble Agrippa .
I do beseech you , Chiefly that I might set it in my prayers , What is your name ?
His word is more than the miraculous harp .
Unbutton here .
Then , world , thou hast a pair of chaps , no more , And throw between them all the food thou hast , They'll grind the one the other .
There lock yourself and send him word you are dead .
This is Trebonius .
God keep you from them , and from such false friends .
Nothing certainer .
Is he not here ?
With all my heart , good youth .
Surely , a princely testimony , a goodly count , Count Comfect , a sweet gallant , surely !
Here is my journey's end , here is my butt , And very sea-mark of my utmost sail .
Right , I mean you .
So , so , so , so !
This , Decius Brutus .
And time is at his period .
Bless thee , Bottom , bless thee .
Indeed , I am no mourner for that news , Because they have been still my adversaries .
I would he knew that I had saved his brother .
Here lie I down and measure out my grave .
Leave all the rest to me .
He forbids it , Being free from vainness and self-glorious pride , Giving full trophy , signal , and ostent Quite from himself , to God .
And for Cassio , let me be his undertaker .
Ay , ay .
Good morrow to my sovereign king and queen , And , princely peers , a happy time of day .
I do not think 't .
That I love her , I feel .
I know not how to pray your patience , Yet I must speak .
Go a little before .
In every good thing .
Some such squire he was That turned your wit the seamy side without And made you to suspect me with the Moor .
He is the general challenger .
If I find a hole in his coat , I will tell him my mind .
I see you do not mean to part with her , Or else you like not of my company .
Be it as you shall privately determine , Either for her stay or going .
Then shall the sighs of Octavia blow the fire up in Caesar , and , as I said before , that which is the strength of their amity shall prove the immediate author of their variance .
Rescue , my lord of Norfolk , rescue , rescue !
Now , gods , stand up for bastards !
I partly feel thee .
How is it else the "man i ' th ' moon" ?
Why , sweet Othello , I have not deserved this .
I know not , sir .
They are beaten , sir , and our advantage serves For a fair victory .
Which they will make an obedient father .
Only foul words , and thereupon I will kiss thee .
Poor bird !
My husband !
Here comes the Prince and Claudio hastily .
The day is yours .
I am afraid He will chastise me .
Pray thee , corporal , stay .
Give me thy hand .
Why , we are still handling our ewes , and their fells , you know , are greasy .
Our purposes God justly hath discovered , And I repent my fault more than my death , Which I beseech Your Highness to forgive , Although my body pay the price of it .
The king is coming .
Sirrah , your father's dead .
Nature wants stuff To vie strange forms with fancy , yet t' imagine An Antony were nature's piece 'gainst fancy , Condemning shadows quite .
I will hear Brutus speak .
Tis time to look about .
No , no , by God's good grace , his son shall reign .
But , as he was ambitious , I slew him .
Worthy prince , I know 't .
How hast thou offended ?
The rest will comfort , for thy counsel's sound .
What , from myself ?
What , are there masques ?
We pray you for your own sake to embrace your own safety and give over this attempt .
I am now from home , and out of that provision Which shall be needful for your entertainment .
Give him tending .
Where is the Master , Boatswain ?
For Antony , I have no ears to his request .
In spite of your heart , I think .
Thou dar'st as well be hanged .
Away with it !
Had he his hurts before ?
Marry , that he had received a thousand ducats of Don John for accusing the Lady Hero wrongfully .
Ay , my lord .
For , my good liege , she is so idly kinged , Her scepter so fantastically borne By a vain , giddy , shallow , humorous youth , That fear attends her not .
I do love nothing in the world so well as you .
You must think this , look you , that the worm will do his kind .
Run one before And let the Queen know of our gests .
So did you me , my liege .
Oh , fie upon them !
The British powers are marching hitherward .
He hath given his empire Up to a whore ; who now are levying The kings o' th' earth for war .
Is there a murderer here ?
Safe in a ditch he bides , With twenty trenched gashes on his head , The least a death to nature .
Come , Desdemona , I have but an hour Of love , of worldly matter and direction , To spend with thee .
All that follow their noses are led by their eyes but blind men , and there's not a nose among twenty but can smell him that's stinking .
Stand there !
I myself could make A chough of as deep chat .
I have seen her die twenty times upon far poorer moment .
Tis time that I were gone .
Oh , thou didst then ne'er love so heartily .
A pleasing cordial , princely Buckingham , Is this thy vow unto my sickly heart .
Ha , ha , ha !
For any good That I myself have done unto myself ?
Who meets us here ?
A very pleasing night to honest men .
He is very busy about it .
The gown is made Just as my master had direction .
I kiss his dirty shoe , and from heartstring I love the lovely bully .
Your voice shall be as strong as any man's In the disposing of new dignities .
But did you think the Prince would have served you thus ?
She mocks all her wooers out of suit .
Fare you well , my liege .
Make her amends , she weeps .
Did your letters pierce the queen to any demonstration of grief ?
I dare , and do defy thee for a villain .
Come , brother ; away !
Marry , that should you if I were your mistress , or I should think my honesty ranker than my wit .
By my life , I do .
He goes forth gallantly .
Why then , your other senses grow imperfect By your eyes ' anguish .
We will haste us .
I have two nights watched with you but can perceive no truth in your report .
The enemy increaseth every day .
Let us be jocund .
Oh , 'tish ill done , 'tish ill done , by my hand , 'tish ill done .
More pity that the eagle should be mewed While kites and buzzards prey at liberty .
Suffolk first died , and York , all haggled over , Comes to him where in gore he lay insteeped And takes him by the beard , kisses the gashes That bloodily did yawn upon his face .
If thou doubt it , thou mayst slide from my shoulder to my heel with no greater a run but my head and my neck .
This is a stem Of that victorious stock , and let us fear The native mightiness and fate of him .
No , that same wicked bastard of Venus that was begot of thought , conceived of spleen , and born of madness , that blind rascally boy that abuses everyone's eyes because his own are out , let him be judge how deep I am in love .
And one Deformed is one of them .
I pray thee , moralize them .
Rumble thy bellyful !
When we shall meet at compt This look of thine will hurl my soul from heaven And fiends will snatch at it .
These ducats pawn I for my father here .
I'll not believe 't .
I know a lady in Venice would have walked barefoot to Palestine for a touch of his nether lip .
He was but a fool that brought My answer back .
If she will stir hither , I shall seem to notify unto her .
Why , you speak truth .
Tide life , tide death , I come without delay .
Let us quit all And give our vineyards to a barbarous people .
Would that he were gone !
This I wonder at , That he , unknown to me , should be in debt .
Macduff is missing , and your noble son .
Robin Starveling , you must play Thisbe's mother. , Tom Snout , the tinker ?
Why then , let fall Your horrible pleasure .
Why , that the Moor first gave to Desdemona , That which so often you did bid me steal .
Our worser thoughts heavens mend .
In respect that it is solitary , I like it very well ; but in respect that it is private , it is a very vile life .
He , when he hears of her , can not refrain From the excess of laughter .
What's the matter ?
I wonder if the lion be to speak .
Why , by making him uncapable of Othello's place : knocking out his brains .
Ay , my lord .
I have a letter guessingly set down , Which came from one that's of a neutral heart , And not from one opposed .
We have consented to all terms of reason .
I hope he is much grown since last I saw him .
More , I prithee , more .
Fare you well .
But now I see our lances are but straws , Our strength as weak , our weakness past compare , That seeming to be most which we indeed least are .
My hearty friends , You take me in too dolorous a sense , For I spake to you for your comfort , did desire you To burn this night with torches .
Use Desdemona well .
What's your will ?
You may think I love you not .
Tranio , let's go .
Declare thine office .
Good my lord , enter .
Not here in presence .
Brutus , bait not me .
How now , Shylock ?
Tis something , nothing : 'T was mine , 'tis his , and has been slave to thousands .
I am sure he is in the fleet .
A hundred then .
Nay , I hope .
Will you hear the letter ?
We must bear all .
Think what thou wilt , I am thy lover's grace .
Let me see his eyes , That , when I note another man like him , I may avoid him .
Come , let me wipe thy face .
I have it not about me .
Thou strik'st not me , 'tis Caesar thou defeat'st .
Lie with her ?
It is .
That's my fear .
I have lived long enough .
For us , we will resign During the life of this old majesty To him our absolute power .
Look I so pale , Lord Dorset , as the rest ?
You'll bear me a bang for that , I fear .
Things base and vile , holding no quantity , Love can transpose to form and dignity .
When they shall see The face of Caesar , they are vanished .
Will you have some more sauce to your leek ?
Come , sir , will you aboard ?
Therefore your Grace may well say I have lost it .
Nothing .
The Queen Of audience nor desire shall fail , so she From Egypt drive her all-disgraced friend Or take his life there .
Farewell .
Not a whit .
It is not for your health thus to commit Your weak condition to the raw , cold morning .
Thou stickest a dagger in me .
Thou liest , thou shag-haired villain !
So , with two seeming bodies but one heart , Two of the first , like coats in heraldry , Due but to one and crowned with one crest .
If thou more murmur'st , I will rend an oak And peg thee in his knotty entrails till Thou hast howled away twelve winters .
No , heavens forfend , I would not kill thy soul !
Good friend , be gone .
What had he done to make him fly the land ?
Added to these , Of knights , esquires , and gallant gentlemen , Eight thousand and four hundred , of the which , Five hundred were but yesterday dubbed knights .
Pleaseth your Grace To appoint some of your council presently To sit with us once more with better heed To resurvey them , we will suddenly Pass our accept and peremptory answer .
The old priest at Saint Luke's Church is at your command at all hours .
Alas , good Kate , I will not burden thee , For knowing thee to be but young and light , Too light for such a swain as you to catch , And yet as heavy as my weight should be .
Therefore great France My mourning and importuned tears hath pitied .
Therefore thou sleep'st so sound .
Oh , noble weakness !
It is gone .
Send Thy token of reprieve .
Hear me , my lord .
To make society The sweeter welcome , we will keep ourself Till suppertime alone .
Amen .
Tear him , tear him !
Why , because he was mad .
Bespeak him a fortnight before. , I will have the heart of him if he forfeit , for were he out of Venice I can make what merchandise I will. , Go , go , Tubal , and meet me at our synagogue .
But speak you on .
But art not thou thyself giddy with the fashion too , that thou hast shifted out of thy tale into telling me of the fashion ?
You may gather more .
Abide within .
Know'st thou Fluellen ?
Why , good sir ?
A Roman .
Use it for my love some other way than swearing by it .
A hundred marks , my Kate does put her down .
Unreal mockery , hence !
The king ?
With no sauce that can be devised to it .
Oh , let us yet be merciful .
My language !
She will taste as like this as a crab does to a crab .
Friends to this ground .
Hark , how these instruments summon to supper .
At least two glasses .
So you may put a man in your belly .
Since I have your good leave to go away , I will make haste .
Who must hang them ?
There's little of the melancholy element in her , my lord .
How now , worthy soldier ?
Talkers are no good doers .
You shall not find , Though you be therein curious , the least cause For what you seem to fear .
Good my complexion , dost thou think though I am caparisoned like a man , I have a doublet and hose in my disposition ?
All this done Upon the gad ? , Edmund , how now ?
Your case is better .
And while thou liv'st , dear Kate , take a fellow of plain and uncoined constancy , for he perforce must do thee right because he hath not the gift to woo in other places .
O , grief hath changed me since you saw me last , And careful hours with time's deformed hand Have written strange defeatures in my face .
O God !
Farewell till then .
False face must hide what the false heart doth know .
Thriftless ambition , that will raven up Thine own lives ' means !
That Petruchio came ?
A beggar , brother ?
Here in these confines slyly have I lurked To watch the waning of mine enemies .
Who dead ?
Do but go after And mark how he continues .
This foul Egyptian hath betrayed me .
A play there is , my lord , some ten words long , Which is as brief as I have known a play .
You have killed a sweet lady , and her death shall fall heavy on you .
I do beseech you That are of suppler joints , follow them swiftly And hinder them from what this ecstasy May now provoke them to .
Do you consent we shall acquaint him with it , As needful in our loves , fitting our duty ?
Smile heaven upon this fair conjunction , That long have frowned upon their enmity .
Malcolm and Donalbain , the king's two sons , Are stol'n away and fled , which puts upon them Suspicion of the deed .
You have prevailed .
Rome , thou hast lost the breed of noble bloods !
My lord of Gloucester hath conveyed him hence .
You say you are a better soldier .
Signor , you are very near my brother in his love .
Your sister is the better soldier .
Then brook abridgment , and your eyes advance After your thoughts , straight back again to France .
One is too poor , too weak for my revenge .
Good Enobarbus , make yourself my guest Whilst you abide here .
These late eclipses in the sun and moon portend no good to us .
They are , my lord .
I'd have thee live , For in my sense 'tis happiness to die .
Do not so .
He does .
Thy evil spirit , Brutus .
The meat was well , if you were so contented .
No .
Why , fare thee well , King .
What , a prisoner ?
Good night , good night .
I will , my lord .
Would they had stayed .
In saying so , you shall but say the truth .
It is impossible .
I would it might be hangers till then .
Your grandfather of famous memory , an't please your Majesty , and your great-uncle Edward the Plack Prince of Wales , as I have read in the chronicles , fought a most prave pattle here in France .
I did not think he had been acquainted with her .
Dispatch .
Under the earth .
I did enact Julius Caesar .
What is the matter , my lord ?
Why would you be so fond to overcome The bonny prizer of the humorous duke ?
I can not tell , except they are busied about a counterfeit assurance .
Well then , it now appears you need my help .
We would not die in that man's company That fears his fellowship to die with us .
Tis his own blame .
Go thy ways to a nunnery .
No , my lord .
Then plainly to her tell my loving tale .
Until I know this sure uncertainty I'll entertain the offered fallacy .
What name , fair lady ?
There could I have him now , and there , and there again , and there .
O villain , villain !
May 't please your Majesty to give us leave Freely to render what we have in charge , Or shall we sparingly show you far off The Dauphin's meaning and our embassy ?
I will make fast the doors and gild myself With some more ducats , and be with you straight .
Lysander , speak again !
Then weigh what loss your honor may sustain If with too credent ear you list his songs , Or lose your heart , or your chaste treasure open To his unmastered importunity .
The cry is still "They come ! " Our castle's strength Will laugh a siege to scorn .
You shall be a woodmonger and buy nothing of me but cudgels .
Can you remember any of the principal evils that he laid to the charge of women ?
Roundly replied .
Tis very much .
If I gave them all my living , I'd keep my coxcombs myself .
You are the lord of duty .
I prithee let me hear it .
Hark , Tranio !
Oh , yes , I heard them all , and more too , for some of them had in them more feet than the verses would bear .
Hence , prating peasant !
Where is he , in his bed ?
I tell you , Captain , if you look in the maps of the 'orld , I warrant you shall find , in the comparisons between Macedon and Monmouth , that the situations , look you , is both alike .
If you did wed my sister for her wealth , Then for her wealth's sake use her with more kindness .
Where lies he ?
That's as much as to say they are fools that marry .
Alas , what ignorant sin have I committed ?
But if I give my wife a handkerchief , What then ?
Here it is .
Here comes one o ' the parings .
What players are they ?
I would rather have one of your father's getting .
O brave monster !
But he , poor man , by your first order died , And that a winged Mercury did bear .
Caesar , I shall .
They were suborned .
Go , one of you , find out the forester .
But little .
Master , is this Mistress Satan ?
All with me's meet that I can fashion fit .
I speak not as in absolute fear of you .
My affections Are then most humble .
Oh , that we then could come by Caesar's spirit And not dismember Caesar !
Are they "informed" of this ?
How is the man esteemed here in the city ?
Hold !
I did send To you for gold to pay my legions , Which you denied me .
My lord !
I had rather be any kind o ' thing than a fool .
But you , my honorable lords , may name the time , And in the duke's behalf I'll give my voice , Which I presume he'll take in gentle part .
All's but naught .
You have an excellent armor , but let my horse have his due .
O most pernicious woman !
She had a song of "Willow , " An old thing 'twas , but it expressed her fortune And she died singing it .
My lord , the first time that I ever saw him Methought he was a brother to your daughter .
Fill , Lucius , till the wine o'erswell the cup .
No , I will weep no more .
You have too much respect upon the world .
Sblood , but you'll not hear me !
Please you , sir , Do not omit the heavy offer of it .
Yes , that you did , sir , and forswore it too .
What news ?
Villains , you did not so when your vile daggers Hacked one another in the sides of Caesar .
I saw them not .
Thanks to your Highness .
Canst thou bring me to th ' party ?
Killing swine .
Tis false .
Tut , I am in their bosoms , and I know Wherefore they do it .
Tonight I take my leave .
How now , Lorenzo ?
My noble lord , What dost thou say , Iago ?
I will be hanged else !
God made him and therefore let him pass for a man .
My brother Gloucester's voice. , Ay , I know thy errand .
Shall I deny you ?
Come forth .
He calls me "boy" and chides as he had power To beat me out of Egypt .
That a woman conceived me , I thank her .
I was of late as petty to his ends As is the morn-dew on the myrtle leaf To his grand sea .
Doth this news hold of good King Edward's death ?
There was blow for blow .
He's fat , and scant of breath. , Here , Hamlet , take my napkin , rub thy brows .
Of that there's none , or little .
Ill spirit , I would hold more talk with thee .
Come , come .
Consider how it stands upon my credit .
Most heathenish and most gross !
I choose her for myself .
Alas , too soon We came aboard .
But , sir , be you ruled by me .
I mean , my head upon your lap ?
Alas , alas !
I am but mad north-north-west .
By God's sonties , 'twill be a hard way to hit .
O wonderful son that can so 'stonish a mother !
And that were much he should , for he is given To sports , to wildness and much company .
Wo , ha , ho !
If we walk not in the trodden paths our very petticoats will catch them .
True !
What is my name ?
Sunday comes apace .
Well , I am glad that all things sort so well .
Oh , my lord , wisdom and blood combating in so tender a body , we have ten proofs to one that blood hath the victory .
Why , sir , give the gods a thankful sacrifice .
If the ill spirit have so fair a house , Good things will strive to dwell with 't .
Spirit , We must prepare to meet with Caliban .
What news ?
Which way hast thou been ?
I loved you not .
No , nor more fearful .
God's peace , I would not lose so great an honor As one man more , methinks , would share from me , For the best hope I have .
Here .
Speak .
Prince Dauphin , you shall stay with us in Rouen .
By Jacob's staff , I swear , I have no mind of feasting forth tonight .
Why , at her father's .
The duke of York commends him to your Majesty .
Thou art sensible in nothing but blows , and so is an ass .
I know it by their pale and deadly looks .
My bones would rest , That have but labored to attain this hour .
Be of good cheer , youth .
Will she go now to bed ?
O bosom black as death !
And be not jealous on me , gentle Brutus .
You see me , Lord Bassanio , where I stand Such as I am .
Of lusty earls : Grandpre and Roussi , Faulconbridge and Foix , Beaumont and Marle , Vaudemont and Lestrale .
Madam , with all my heart .
Oh , no , good Kate .
Do that good mischief which may make this island Thine own for ever , and I , thy Caliban , For aye thy foot-licker .
For England his approaches makes as fierce As waters to the sucking of a gulf .
Is not tomorrow , boy , the ides of March ?
What , keep a week away ?
Come hither , fellow .
I humbly thank you , sir .
Sir , the Queen .
Why , she hath a face of her own .
Now , where's my wife ?
What , art thou come ? , On , gentlemen , away !
Time , thou anticipat'st my dread exploits .
Know you not , master , to some kind of men Their graces serve them but as enemies ?
Come on , Nerissa , I have work in hand That you yet know not of .
If she live long , And in the end meet the old course of death , Women will all turn monsters .
I say thy husband .
Only he hath not yet subscribed this : Where your Majesty demands that the king of France , having any occasion to write for matter of grant , shall name your Highness in this form and with this addition , in French : Nor this I have not , brother , so denied But your request shall make me let it pass .
It hath made me mad .
I am gone , though I am here .
I'll venture so much of my hawk or hound , But twenty times so much upon my wife .
As a friend .
Yet you have all the vantage of her wrong .
What , are they children ?
My way is now to hie home to his house And tell his wife that , being lunatic , He rushed into my house and took perforce My ring away .
Myself have to mine own turned enemy .
I'll tell thee more of this another time .
The sky , it seems , would pour down stinking pitch , But that the sea , mounting to th ' welkin's cheek , Dashes the fire out .
Hence , saucy eunuch !
They are weary ?
Now the fleeting moon No planet is of mine .
Therefore , my lords , omit no happy hour That may give furth'rance to our expedition ; For we have now no thought in us but France , Save those to God , that run before our business .
Cassio's my worthy friend , My lord , I see you're moved .
Yes , Captain , but with this acknowledgement : That God fought for us .
Say that they slack their duties
Now I change my mind , And partly credit things that do presage .
It makes us , or it mars us .
Sola , sola !
I remember You did supplant your brother Prospero .
His neigh is like the bidding of a monarch , and his countenance enforces homage .
The foul fiend haunts Poor Tom in the voice of a nightingale .
So that , as clear as is the summer's sun , King Pepin's title and Hugh Capet's claim , King Lewis his satisfaction , all appear To hold in right and title of the female .
And let those that play your clowns speak no more than is set down for them , for there be of them that will themselves laugh to set on some quantity of barren spectators to laugh too , though in the meantime some necessary question of the play be then to be considered .
How have you slept , my lord ?
I partly guess , for I have loved ere now .
When he is best he is a little worse than a man , and when he is worst he is little better than a beast .
How now , what's the matter ?
He is all the mother's , from the top to toe .
I am now in great haste , as it may appear unto you .
Give me thy hand .
I hope he be in love .
Then thus : Baptista is safe , talking with the deceiving father of a deceitful son .
Hear his speech but say thou nought .
My lord , I warrant you we will play our part As he shall think by our true diligence He is no less than what we say he is .
Rather a ditch in Egypt Be gentle grave unto me .
Is 't possible ?
Get you therefore hence , Poor miserable wretches , to your death , The taste whereof God of His mercy give You patience to endure , and true repentance Of all your dear offences. , Bear them hence .
This is the sergeant Who like a good and hardy soldier fought 'Gainst my captivity .
A good wench , give it me .
Done .
I would cure you if you would but call me Rosalind and come every day to my cote and woo me .
In both my eyes he doubly sees himself , In each eye , one .
Double , double toil and trouble , Fire burn and cauldron bubble .
You know me well .
Anon , anon !
I'll torture him .
She's but the sign and semblance of her honor .
Within a month , Ere yet the salt of most unrighteous tears Had left the flushing in her galled eyes , She married .
Tis brief , my lord .
I'll not expostulate with her , lest her body and beauty unprovide my mind again , This night , Iago !
Farewell , father .
None that I more love than myself .
I have made it for you .
Do it carefully. , And the noble and true-hearted Kent banished , his offense honesty !
I have promised to make all this matter even .
Dighton and Forrest , whom I did suborn To do this piece of ruthless butchery , Albeit they were fleshed villains , bloody dogs , Melted with tenderness and mild compassion , Wept like two children in their deaths ' sad story .
Ay , widow Dido .
Oh , withered is the garland of the war .
The taper burneth in your closet , sir .
And therefore , I pray thee , news .
How is 't , my noble lord ?
He was not sad , for he would shine on those That make their looks by his .
I'll go with you .
Away , slight man !
Not know me yet ?
If I should say , I saw such islanders , For , certes , these are people of the island , Who , though they are of monstrous shape , yet note , Their manners are more gentle-kind than of Our human generation you shall find Many , nay , almost any .
Your Grace does me as great honors as can be desired in the hearts of his subjects .
Is it no more but this , a tardiness in nature Which often leaves the history unspoke That it intends to do ? , My lord of Burgundy , What say you to the lady ?
You are very sensible , and yet you miss my sense : I mean , Hortensio is afeard of you .
Madam !
That sir which serves and seeks for gain , And follows but for form , Will pack when it begins to rain And leave thee in the storm .
Thou wouldst make a good fool .
I will go before , sir. , Mistress , look out at window , for all this .
I am content you shall entreat me stay , But yet not stay , entreat me how you can .
Bear them from hence .
Wherefore ?
Prince John is this morning secretly stolen away .
My lord , he's going to his mother's closet .
What , bear her in hand until they come to take hands and then , with public accusation , uncovered slander , unmitigated rancor , O God , that I were a man !
Uncle !
Ay , by heaven , my lord .
By and by .
Ay , and for that thou diest .
Here come two noble beasts in , a man and a lion .
There's none else by .
The noise they make Will cause Demetrius to awake .
His passport shall be made , And crowns for convoy put into his purse .
Stand thee close , then , under this penthouse , for it drizzles rain , and I will , like a true drunkard , utter all to thee .
If the English had any apprehension , they would run away .
What is she ?
What , says the married woman you may go ?
Chid I for that at frugal Nature's frame ?
A fire , good Curtis .
But Oh , how bitter a thing it is to look into happiness through another man's eyes .
Fore heaven , an excellent song .
Woe to the land that's governed by a child .
Well , I will thither .
Do I speak you fair ?
With lawyers in the vacation , for they sleep between term and term , and then they perceive not how time moves .
Time calls upon 's .
Good morrow to you both .
Cassio did top her , ask thy husband else .
We'll overreach the graybeard , Gremio , The narrow-prying father , Minola , The quaint musician , amorous Litio , All for my master's sake , Lucentio .
Speak you so gently ?
Illo , ho , ho , my lord !
If you had known the virtue of the ring , Or half her worthiness that gave the ring , Or your own honor to contain the ring , You would not then have parted with the ring .
Some officers take them away .
O mercy , God !
O true , good Catesby .
Ha , let me see .
Madam , withdraw : the Prince , the Count , Signor Benedick , Don John , and all the gallants of the town are come to fetch you to church .
Let's ha ' 't , good Grumio .
And of the heat of the ginger .
Sweet Hero , now thy image doth appear In the rare semblance that I loved it first .
A howling monster , a drunken monster .
Your lady , sir , your lady .
The taming school ?
Yet , when we can entreat an hour to serve , We would spend it in some words upon that business , If you would grant the time .
Now , out of doubt Antipholus is mad ; Else would he never so demean himself .
A good and virtuous nature may recoil In an imperial charge .

Marry , on Hero , the daughter and heir of Leonato .
These tidings will well comfort Cassius .
He'll make your Paris Louvre shake for it , Were it the mistress court of mighty Europe .
I hope they will not come upon us now .
If I speak like myself in this , let him be whipped that first finds it so .
Farewell .
If he come not , then the play is marred .
What , To kiss in private ?
I'll make a sop o ' th ' moonshine of you .
You are a royal one , and we obey you .
No , indeed are they not .
An honest man he is , and hates the slime That sticks on filthy deeds .
He therefore sends you , meeter for your spirit , This tun of treasure , and , in lieu of this , Desires you let the dukedoms that you claim Hear no more of you .
So , thanks to all at once and to each one , Whom we invite to see us crowned at Scone .
Would that fault were mine !
My brave spirit !
Masters , the duke is coming from the temple , and there is two or three lords and ladies more married .
Every inordinate cup is unblessed and the ingredient is a devil .
So perhaps did yours .
Myself am Naples , Who with mine eyes , never since at ebb , beheld The king my father wracked .
Thou didst prevent me .
Are they good ?
These are portents , but yet I hope , I hope They do not point on me .
Call up the right Master Constable .
He , that Caliban Whom now I keep in service .
I believe drink gave thee the lie last night .
Your worth is very dear in my regard .
If the enemy is an ass and a fool and a prating coxcomb , is it meet , think you , that we should also , look you , be an ass and a fool and a prating coxcomb , in your own conscience , now ?
Or is the adder better than the eel Because his painted skin contents the eye ?
Thou hast wronged Caius Ligarius .
O , she that might have intercepted thee , By strangling thee in her accursed womb , From all the slaughters , wretch , that thou hast done .
Go .
Oh ho , oh ho !

Thy father !
First resolve me that .
Yet Benedick was such another , and now is he become a man .

Robin Starveling , the tailor ?
A brave vessel Who had , no doubt , some noble creature in her Dashed all to pieces .
Her only fault , and that is faults enough , Is that she is intolerable curst , And shrewd and froward , so beyond all measure That , were my state far worser than it is , I would not wed her for a mine of gold .
All the pictures fairest lined Are but black to Rosalind .
Speak it again and , even with the word , This hand , which for thy love did kill thy love , Shall for thy love kill a far truer love .
But who is with him ?
Hear you , my lords , We have some haste , Leonato .
His name's Cinna .
Now , my friendly knave , I thank thee .
If more thou dost perceive , let me know more .
Why , thou silly gentleman !
By my troth , I speak my thought .
The blow thou hadst Shall make thy peace for moving me to rage , And I will boot thee with what gift beside Thy modesty can beg .
Make it no wonder .
What is here ?
One knocks .
Well , sir .
Flat burglary as ever was committed .
The best news is that we have safely found Our king and company .
What , are you mad ?
I shall remember .
And you are come in very happy time To bear my greeting to the senators And tell them that I will not come today .
That's as much as to say , the sweet youth's in love .
I have a reasonable good ear in music .
Speak , I charge you .
Is 't possible ?
But hollow men , like horses hot at hand , Make gallant show and promise of their mettle .
And that were enough to hang us all .
Never excuse , for when the players are all dead , there needs none to be blamed .
I am sorry for her , as I have just cause , being her uncle and her guardian .
On my knees I beg That you'll vouchsafe me raiment , bed , and food." Good sir , no more .

A privilege never to see me more .
Sir , in fine , Seeing how loathly opposite I stood To his unnatural purpose , in fell motion , With his prepared sword he charges home My unprovided body , latched mine arm .
The generals would have some words .
You must say "paragon." A "paramour" is , God bless us , a thing of naught .
Tedious" and "brief" ?
I do begin to have bloody thoughts .
Pray you , go with us .
No hope that way is Another way so high a hope that even Ambition can not pierce a wink beyond , But doubt discovery there .
Right , as snow in harvest .
Come hither , Proculeius .
Let us die .
Where is this sight ?

It curvets unseasonably .

That I beheld .
Nothing , but this is so .
Zounds , I'll entreat no more .
Why , that's spoken like an honest drover ; so they sell bullocks .

What is she ?
This would drink deep .

Where died she ?
If that you were the good Sir Rowland's son , As you have whispered faithfully you were , And as mine eye doth his effigies witness Most truly limned and living in your face , Be truly welcome hither .
Friends , Romans , countrymen , lend me your ears .
This contents .
Why , Fool ?
Under what captain serve you ?
A king , perhaps , My lord , How chance the prophet could not at that time Have told me , I being by , that I should kill him ?
Ay , my good lord .
Come , come , you froward and unable worms !
Because that I familiarly sometimes Do use you for my fool and chat with you , Your sauciness will jest upon my love And make a common of my serious hours .
It nothing ill becomes thee. , Aboard my galley I invite you all .
Or stole it , rather .
For certain she is dead , and by strange manner .
Where is he ?
How heavy weighs my lord !
I hear their drum .
I should be angry with you if the time were convenient .
What , all so soon asleep ?
Poor painted queen , vain flourish of my fortune , Why strew'st thou sugar on that bottled spider , Whose deadly web ensnareth thee about ?
This green plot shall be our stage , this hawthorn-brake our tiring-house , and we will do it in action as we will do it before the duke .
Howe'er thou art a fiend , A woman's shape doth shield thee .
Say from whence You owe this strange intelligence , or why Upon this blasted heath you stop our way With such prophetic greeting .
Take me up .
To th ' church take the priest , clerk , and some sufficient honest witnesses .
I will , sir .
If thou rememb'rest not the slightest folly That ever love did make thee run into , Thou hast not loved .
O thou invisible spirit of wine , if thou hast no name to be known by , let us call thee devil !
Dismiss me ?
Here's packing , with a witness , to deceive us all !
Fly not .
Most true .
Tell him I have moved my lord on his behalf , and hope all will be well .
Again !
True , my lord .
Ah , good Demetrius , wilt thou give him me ?
Slay !
I must remove Some thousands of these logs and pile them up , Upon a sore injunction .
It well appears .
Well , be it so .

I will not hear thee speak .
I will not have to do with you .
None in the world , nor do I know the man .
I thought that all things had been savage here , And therefore put I on the countenance Of stern commandment .
What , my good lord ?
Speak , my fair , and fairly , I pray thee .
Hath not else his eye Stray'd his affection in unlawful love , A sin prevailing much in youthful men Who give their eyes the liberty of gazing ?
Charmian !
I pray you mar no more of my verses with reading them ill- favoredly .
Ha ?
Letters , my lord , from Hamlet .
No , thou proud dream , That play'st so subtly with a king's repose .
Macbeth .
Young Edward lives ; think now what I would speak .
Here is a wonder , if you talk of a wonder .
No , Caesar , we will answer on their charge .
But of that tomorrow , When therewithal we shall have cause of state Craving us jointly .
Ay , let her rot and perish and be damned tonight , for she shall not live .
No , uncle , I'll none .
What's that ?
I ' faith , sir , you shall never need to fear .
We'll give them present audience .
If thy speech be sooth , I care not if thou dost for me as much .
Be silent .
How now , my lord !
The consequence is , then , thy jealous fits Have scared thy husband from the use of wits .

No , truly , unless thou wert hard-favored , for honesty coupled to beauty is to have honey a sauce to sugar .
Which is he that killed the deer ?
Marry , that can Hero !
A golden mind stoops not to shows of dross .
Who's gone this morning ?
My lord .
So be it .
She's full of most blessed condition .
Is 't so , indeed .
But those that understood him smiled at one another and shook their heads .
Methinks I have a great desire to a bottle of hay .
You are pictures out of door , bells in your parlors , wild-cats in your kitchens , saints in your injuries , devils being offended , players in your housewifery , and housewives in your beds .
You laugh when boys or women tell their dreams .
Good my lord , tell it .
Fly further off , my lord , fly further off .
But I pray you , tell me , is my boy , God rest his soul , alive or dead ?
He gives you upon his knees a thousand thanks , and he esteems himself happy that he hath fall'n into the hands of one , as he thinks , the most brave , valorous , and thrice- worthy seigneur of England .
Be it so , Lysander .
Twas he informed against him , And quit the house on purpose that their punishment Might have the freer course .
Who offered him the crown ?
Had you rather Caesar were living and die all slaves , than that Caesar were dead , to live all free men ?
There thou shouldst be ; By this great clatter , one of the greatest note Seems bruited .
Marry , it is your brother's right hand .
I never heard So musical a discord , such sweet thunder .
The spring , the head , the fountain of your blood Is stopped ; the very source of it is stopped .
He shall have merely justice and his bond .
God's my life , where's the Sexton ?
Follow me .
Tomorrow will we be married .
What is it ?
We must die , Messala .
In cunning I must draw my sword upon you .
Where be thy tenants and thy followers ?
I fear me you'll be in till then .
Will you go with me ?
O , that once more you knew but what you are !
Yes , certainly , and out of doubt and out of question , too , and ambiguities .
Most happy !
When I wore it at your daughter's marriage ?

What is it that you would impart to me ?
Let me see .
On Tuesday noon , or night , or Wednesday morn .
Pray God it be , sir .
Now he tells how she plucked him to my chamber .
I have too grieved a heart To take a tedious leave .
Take up the sword again , or take up me .
Send out more horses .
Make peace with God , for you must die , my lord .
I'll rest .
How now , you secret , black , and midnight hags ?
O , my fair cousin , I must not say so .
These things , come thus to light , Smother her spirits up .
Let us not break with him , For he will never follow anything That other men begin .
Believe not so .
I guess at it .
Ah , how much might the man deserve of me that would right her !
Thus have I , Wall , my part discharged so .
At land , thou know'st How much we do o'ercount thee .
Oh , how he loves Caesar !
Will you sup there ?
Not Caesar's valor hath o'erthrown Antony , But Antony's hath triumphed on itself .
Would you , the supervisor , grossly gape on , Behold her topped ?
I see , sir , you have found the goldsmith now .
Affection is not rated from the heart .
Some tardy cripple bear the countermand , That came too lag to see him buried .
But what talk I of this ?
Ay , my good lord .
Speak , Count , 'tis your cue .
It follows , then , the cat must stay at home .
Stay , you imperfect speakers , tell me more .
That is the very defect of the matter , sir .
O this learning , what a thing it is !
Murder , murder !
Adultery ?
One cried , "God bless us ! " and "Amen" the other , As they had seen me with these hangman's hands .

What wood is this before us ?
Wilt come ?
How fares our cousin , noble Lord of York ?
This if she perform , She shall not sue unheard .
Good sir , draw near to me .
Great happiness !
A foolish heart , that I leave here behind .
What's the matter ?
Hence !
How fares my gracious sir ?
All's hushed as midnight yet .
Five summers have I spent in farthest Greece , Roaming clean through the bounds of Asia , And , coasting homeward , came to Ephesus , Hopeless to find , yet loath to leave unsought Or that or any place that harbors men .
I'll tell you who time ambles withal , who time trots withal , who time gallops withal , and who he stands still withal .
What's your grace's will ?
Faith , the priest was good enough , for all the old gentleman's saying .
Here the street is narrow .
Be ruled by me ; depart in patience , And let us to the Tiger all to dinner , And about evening come yourself alone To know the reason of this strange restraint .
Tie up the libertine in a field of feasts , Keep his brain fuming .
Oh , this is it that makes your servants droop !
Run away , I pray you !
My sovereign lord , I do beseech your Highness To take our brother Clarence to your grace .
Where is my lady ?
Who , I , my lord ?
This Caesar was a tyrant .
None , Brutus , none .
Say , how grows it due ?
Till then , my noble friend , chew upon this : Brutus had rather be a villager Than to repute himself a son of Rome Under these hard conditions as this time Is like to lay upon us .
How if he will not stand ?
I am content .
Here is everything advantageous to life .
Call them again .
If I could win a lady at leapfrog or by vaulting into my saddle with my armor on my back , under the correction of bragging be it spoken , I should quickly leap into a wife .

Is it for him you do envy me so ?

Good madam , do .
Confess and love" Had been the very sum of my confession .
Where should they be set else ?
This is a sleepy tune .
Wherefore , bold peasant , Darest thou support a published traitor ?
What , is he dead ?
Was he not companion with the riotous knights That tend upon my father ?
Lorenzo , and thy love .
What , shall we toward the Tower ?
I do not , sir .
She that herself will sliver and disbranch From her material sap perforce must wither And come to deadly use .
Three thousand ducats , well .
Cassio , my lord ?
So thou , that hast no unkind mate to grieve thee , With urging helpless patience would relieve me ; But , if thou live to see like right bereft , This fool-begged patience in thee will be left .
When I have plucked thy rose I can not give it vital growth again , It must needs wither .
What do they in the north When they should serve their sovereign in the west ?
Young budding virgin , fair and fresh and sweet , Whither away , or where is thy abode ?
In such a night To shut me out !
Who knows not he is dead !
I am doubtful that you have been conjunct And bosomed with her as far as we call hers .
A pair of stocks , you rogue !
No , nor I neither , but most wonderful that she should so dote on Signor Benedick , whom she hath in all outward behaviors seemed ever to abhor .
Cupid is a knavish lad Thus to make poor females mad .
He is a dreamer .
But what of Cicero ?
What , my dear Lady Disdain !
I had myself notice of my brother's purpose herein and have by underhand means labored to dissuade him from it ; but he is resolute .
Nay , take my life and all .
Mark me .
Hence .
They are natural." For I believe they are portentous things Unto the climate that they point upon .
Dead , dead ?
I think I did , sir .
How I have thought of this and of these times I shall recount hereafter .
This is mere madness .
It is , and wants but nomination .
Let's follow , Gertrude .
Would you buy her , that you enquire after her ?
Therefore thou must be hanged at the state's charge .
But 'tis all one ; 'tis alike as my fingers is to my fingers , and there is salmons in both .
The point envenomed too ! , Then , venom , to thy work .
Madam my interpreter , what says she ?
It can not be .
Madam , here comes my lord .
Do you think I'll be forsworn ?
I have within my mind A thousand raw tricks of these bragging jacks Which I will practice .
He did not call , he's busy in the paper .
I will but spend a word here in the house And go with you .
Gentlemen all , I do suspect this trash To be a party in this injury. , Patience awhile , good Cassio. , Come , come , Lend me a light .
Come , shall we fall to work ?
I have a daughter , sir , called Katherina .
Best of comfort , And ever welcome to us .
Sure he hath killed his wife .
Thou shalt not die .

Nay , yet there's more in this .
Farewell , kind Charmian .
Pray thee , go seek him , and bring him to my tent .
When I told you My state was nothing , I should then have told you That I was worse than nothing , for indeed I have engaged myself to a dear friend , Engaged my friend to his mere enemy To feed my means .
They say he cried out of sack .
Then shall I bleed to death .
The lady is dead upon mine and my master's false accusation .
Tis truly so .
Tis fittest .
The valiant never taste of death but once .
I tell thee , Kate , 'twas burnt and dried away .
Why , tell me , is not this my Cambio ?
She wished she had not heard it , yet she wished That heaven had made her such a man .
Behold , there stand the caskets , noble Prince .
But yet methinks it is very sultry and hot for my complexion .
You are now within a foot Of th ' extreme verge .
Such as I am , I come from Antony .
Stephano !
Here thought they to have done Some wanton charm upon this man and maid , Whose vows are that no bed-right shall be paid Till Hymen's torch be lighted , but in vain .
Cold , cold , my girl , Even like thy chastity .
How goes the world with thee ?
Of what color ?
Indeed , he is so .
Lesser than Macbeth and greater .
Our reasons are so full of good regard That were you , Antony , the son of Caesar , You should be satisfied .
But it is no English treason to cut French crowns , and tomorrow the king himself will be a clipper .
Help !
Say then my peace is made .
God be wi ' you .
Or to be naked with her friend in bed An hour or more , not meaning any harm ?
Then both , or one , or anything thou wilt .
Master , master , look about you .
And so it is .
Why , here begins his morning story right ; These two Antipholuses , these two so like , And these two Dromios , one in semblance , Besides her urging of her wreck at sea , These are the parents to these children , Which accidentally are met together .
Is this true ?
O , belike his majesty hath some intent That you shall be new christened in the Tower .
We are blest that Rome is rid of him .
He's safe for these three hours .
Let me hear Agrippa further speak .
Art thou indeed ?
Murder , murder !
You have heard much .
Why , this was molded on a porringer !
What's to say ?
Upon them !
What shall be our sport , then ?
Scant not my cups , and make as much of me As when mine empire was your fellow too , And suffered my command .
And so falls it out With Rivers , Vaughan , Grey ; and so 'twill do With some men else that think themselves as safe As thou and I , who , as thou know'st , are dear To princely Richard and to Buckingham .
What is your will that I shall do with this ?
Alas , you know not .
How green !
You may relish him more in the soldier than in the scholar .
I can not tell wat is dat .
Right joyous are we to behold your face , Most worthy brother England .
I warrant it is to knight you , Captain .
But , by 'r Lady , he must build churches then , or else shall he suffer not thinking on , with the hobby-horse , whose epitaph is "For , oh , for , oh , the hobby-horse is forgot." What means this , my lord ?
Your name , I pray you , friend ?
Sir , I am vexed .
Now , by my hood , a gentle and no Jew .
I'll fight till from my bones my flesh be hacked .
Revenges burn in them , for their dear causes Would to the bleeding and the grim alarm Excite the mortified man .
Honest , ay , honest .
Pray you , hasten Your generals after .
My mind was never yet more mercenary .
But , sirrah , mark , we use To say the dead are well .
But such officers do the king best service in the end .
Thieves !
I would I were at home .
But , room , fairy !
Then burst his mighty heart , And , in his mantle muffling up his face , Even at the base of Pompey's statue , Which all the while ran blood , great Caesar fell .
Come , let's all take hands Till that the conquering wine hath steeped our sense In soft and delicate Lethe .
How many months Do you desire ?
And I have reason for it .
God make your Majesty joyful , as you have been .
Trust me , I am glad on 't .
Beware the thane of Fife .
I would my horse had the speed of your tongue and so good a continuer .
I pray you , master , tell me ?
Hang out our banners on the outward walls .
Oh , ominous !
Aunchient Pistol , I do partly understand your meaning .
God , God forgive us all !
Remorseless , treacherous , lecherous , kindless villain !
Descend .
Was it so late , friend , ere you went to bed , That you do lie so late ?
I serve the king , On whose employment I was sent to you .
Mistress , we have .
You lie out on 't , sir , and therefore it is not yours .
How shall we find the concord of this discord ?
Go you down that way towards the Capitol .
Well , I will hie , And so bestow these papers as you bade me .
Mark well Metellus Cimber .
What's the wager ?
Lucius ! , Fast asleep ?
Fare thee well !
This castle hath a pleasant seat .
Now are we well prepared to know the pleasure Of our fair cousin Dauphin , for we hear Your greeting is from him , not from the king .
What , dost thou scorn me for my gentle counsel , And soothe the devil that I warn thee from ?
Hail to thee , thane of Glamis !
I see the ruin of my house .
With all my heart .
Villainous whore !
How does my royal lord ?
And then came Pyramus .
I pray thee , sing , and let me woo no more .
Mend the instance , shepherd .
True , " said she , "a fine little one." "No , " said I , "a great wit." "Right , " says she , "a great gross one." "Nay , " said I , "a good wit." "Just , " said she , "it hurts nobody." "Nay , " said I , "the gentleman is wise." "Certain , " said she , "a wise gentleman." "Nay , " said I , "he hath the tongues." "That I believe , " said she , "for he swore a thing to me on Monday night , which he forswore on Tuesday morning ; there's a double tongue , there's two tongues." Thus did she an hour together transshape thy particular virtues .
Cicero one ?
I am the very man , I'll see that straight .
Ay , my lord .
My lord , my lord , I'll prove it on his body if he dare , Despite his nice fence and his active practice , His May of youth and bloom of lustihood .
Go show your slaves how choleric you are And make your bondmen tremble .
How should that be ?
Call the slave again .
I have laid those sheets you bade me on the bed .
tis not so now .
Indeed , he plied them both with excellent praises .
Ourself will mingle with society And play the humble host .
Take your place .
In what part of her body stands Ireland ?
Master Fer .
Double , double toil and trouble , Fire burn and cauldron bubble .
A good persuasion .
Thou art too like the spirit of Banquo .
Alack , my lord , that fault is none of yours .
Do you not know me , Father ?
Most royal sir , Fleance is 'scaped .
I'll do 't .
Yet at the first I saw the treasons planted .
And you , sir , for this chain arrested me .
He was the wretched'st thing when he was young , So long a-growing and so leisurely , That if this rule were true , he should be gracious .
So young , my lord , and true .
I pray thee , overname them .
Give me some ink and paper .
It is shaped , sir , like itself , and it is as broad as it hath breadth .
Not on thy sole , but on thy soul , harsh Jew , Thou makest thy knife keen .
Now , fellows , you are welcome .
But 'tis not so .
And what's he then that says I play the villain ?
Is he arrayed ?
Ay , so I thought .
Foul words is but foul wind , and foul wind is but foul breath , and foul breath is noisome .
They , for their truth , might better wear their heads Than some that have accused them wear their hats .
Brutus , my lord .
Well , I will do it , though I take thee in the king's company .
Truly , sir , all that I live by is with the awl .
thee aloud "England is thine , Ireland is thine , France is thine , and Harry Plantagenet is thine , " who , though I speak it before his face , if he be not fellow with the best king , thou shalt find the best king of good fellows .
O heavens !
Cassius , Be not deceived .
There it goes , Silver !
Ay , on my life , and hopes to find you forward Upon his party for the gain thereof ; And thereupon he sends you this good news , That this same very day your enemies , The kindred of the queen , must die at Pomfret .
I know they are in Rome together Looking for Antony .
I'll mark the play .
Well , I will undertake it .
Was not Charles , the duke's wrestler , here to speak with me ?
There is more sense in that than in reputation .
No , sir , I say his horse comes , with him on his back .
But fear not yet To take upon you what is yours .
How now , my dear Othello ?
I have no will to wander forth of doors , Yet something leads me forth .
Here , master .
Let us hear him .
Bring him silently .
Oh , ho , monster , we know what belongs to a frippery. , Put off that gown , Trinculo .
These are gracious drops .
No , by no means .
You shall advise me in all for Cleopatra .
Now , forward with your tale. , Prithee , stand farther off .
I thank thee for that jest .
And so have I addressed me .
Well , tell me now what lady is the same To whom you swore a secret pilgrimage , That you today promised to tell me of ?
My countryman , but yet I know him not .
They know By th' height , the lowness , or the mean , if dearth Or foison follow .
For divers unknown reasons , I beseech you , Grant me this boon .
Fore heaven , they have given me a rouse already .
Why will My lord do so ?
Trust me , I could do much , Prithee , no more .
Yes , the fashion is the fashion .
To what end did I bid thee hie thee home ?
What , art mad ?
Then , tell me , Who's the next heir of Naples ?
For there was never yet fair woman but she made mouths in a glass .
Alack the day , I know you not , young gentleman .
For his valor can not carry his discretion , and the fox carries the goose .
I do , and surely It is a sleepy language , and thou speak'st Out of thy sleep .
I am more proud to be Sir Rowland's son , His youngest son , and would not change that calling To be adopted heir to Frederick .
Demetrius , I will keep my word with thee .
Write from us to him .
Perhaps I will return immediately .
Nay , weep not , gentle Eros .
How then , sick ?
I fear he will .
Is not that strange ?
To Brutus ' , to Cassius ' , burn all .
And in good time here the lieutenant comes. , Master Lieutenant , pray you , by your leave , How doth the prince and my young son of York ?
And twenty of these puny lies I'll tell , That men shall swear I have discontinued school Above a twelvemonth .
I have them ready .
I beseech you , sir , pardon me .
Pray God , sir , your wife send you not a worse .
Belike for want of rain , which I could well Beteem them from the tempest of my eyes .
Name what part I am for and proceed .
Vouchsafe , divine perfection of a woman , Of these supposed crimes to give me leave By circumstance but to acquit myself .
What news ?
Since the torch is out , Lie down and stray no farther .
Since I came hither , Which I can call but now , I have heard strange news .
Let it be so .
Tis very like .
He hath done good service , lady , in these wars .
I'll see thee hanged on Sunday first .
Now fare you well , good sir .
Ceres , most bounteous lady , thy rich leas Of wheat , rye , barley , vetches , oats , and peas ; Thy turfy mountains , where live nibbling sheep , And flat meads thatched with stover , them to keep ; Thy banks with pioned and twilled brims ,
Down , and swear .
A witty mother !
And this same progeny of evils comes From our debate , from our dissension .
Let me deal in this .
Woo't fast ?
As a friend or an enemy ?
Confess ! , Handkerchief ! , Oh , devil ! , Work on , My medicine , work !
Let's withdraw , my lord .
Our preparation stands In expectation of them .
And therefore , good Grumio , the news .
Oh , that I were a fool !
If so , be patient , sister .
Upon what bargain do you give it me ?
Have I not reason , beldams as you are ?
Oh , now you weep , and , I perceive , you feel The dint of pity .
Now , by this hand , I swear , I scorn the term , Nor shall my Nell keep lodgers .
If either of you know any inward impediment why you should not be conjoined , charge you on your souls to utter it .
This disturbed sky Is not to walk in .
The interim's mine .
Hold , ho !
More company !
Excellent , i ' faith , of the chameleon's dish .
The higher Nilus swells The more it promises .
For I am he am born to tame you , Kate , And bring you from a wild Kate to a Kate Conformable as other household Kates .
I can not be a man with wishing , therefore I will die a woman with grieving .
How comes that ?
No , nor mine now .
How now , Cassio !
Good gentlemen , let me have leave to speak .
Not till God make men of some other metal than earth .
Here , at thy hand .
O Cassio , whence came this ?
He lies to th ' heart .
Your Majesty came not like yourself .
Come , go with me apart .
You will be whipped .
I have almost forgot the taste of fears .
See , see , here comes the man we went to seek .
Most royal majesty , I crave no more than hath your highness offered .
Sweet soul , let's in , and there expect their coming .
But thou wouldst not think how ill all's here about my heart .
A kind good night to all !
This day I breathed first .
You are as well provided of both as any prince in the world .
Then know that from my soul I love thy daughter .
Who's there ?
I know this , and thus I challenge it .
How fearful And dizzy 'tis to cast one's eyes so low !
Tarry , Jew .
Away !
The day will come that thou shalt wish for me To help thee curse that poisonous bunch-backed toad .
Dost thou not suspect my years ?
Helena , adieu .
Reproach and everlasting shame Sits mocking in our plumes .
Nay , I pray you let me go .
Come , hang them on this line .
Thou art a soul in bliss , but I am bound Upon a wheel of fire , that mine own tears Do scald like molten lead .
You kill me to deny it .
Our hour Is fully out .
I will not till I please .
Never make denial .
O dear discretion , how his words are suited !
Not a jot , not a jot .
And so he goes to heaven .
My ever-gentle cousin , welcome hither .
Hold , worthy lady , hold !
No , though thou call'st thyself a hotter name Than any is in hell .
Let's not consort with them .
For when mine hours Were nice and lucky , men did ransom lives Of me for jests ; but now I'll set my teeth And send to darkness all that stop me .
I have not seen him this two days .
Thus have I politicly begun my reign , And 'tis my hope to end successfully .
Are we all met ?
He is not yet arrived .
But while thou livest , keep a good tongue in thy head .
Why , he's a devil , a devil , a very fiend .
And mine shall .
How tartly that gentleman looks !
If you dare fight today , come to the field .
Sawst thou the melancholy Lord Northumberland ?
I shall be there before thee .
What trumpet is that same ?
My pretty cousins , you mistake me both .
Then must thou needs find out new heaven , new earth .
It may be , these apparent prodigies , The unaccustomed terror of this night , And the persuasion of his augurers May hold him from the Capitol today .
Let's stay and hear the will .
Thou hast .
Rebellious dead , rise never till the wood Of Birnam rise , and our high-placed Macbeth Shall live the lease of nature , pay his breath To time and mortal custom .
I tell you , 'twill sound harshly in her ears .
O my follies !
So is Lysander .
Princes and counties !
Stones have been known to move , and trees to speak .
Wast born i ' th ' forest here ?

It must be so , for miracles are ceased , And therefore we must needs admit the means How things are perfected .
You know not why we came to visit you , Thus out of season , threading dark-eyed night .
My lord !
Note this before my notes : There's not a note of mine that's worth the noting .
Oh , wretched villain !

Away , I do beseech you , both away .

Thy adversary's wife doth pray for thee .
Why , gentle sweet , you shall see no such thing .

Why , very well then .
How far'st thou , soldier ?
Are you a married man or a bachelor ?
Know'st thou the youth that spoke to me erewhile ?
Please , let me stay .
Show me briefly how .

Fellow Grumio !
He had a kind of taste. , Well , my conscience says , "Launcelot , budge not." "Budge ! " says the fiend .
These growing feathers plucked from Caesar's wing Will make him fly an ordinary pitch , Who else would soar above the view of men And keep us all in servile fearfulness .
I commend my duty to your lordship .
What have I kept back ?
Caesar sits down in Alexandria , where I will oppose his fate .
Face not me .
You know me well , and herein spend but time To wind about my love with circumstance .
And now who knows But you , Lorenzo , whether I am yours ?
O coward conscience , how dost thou afflict me !
If you deny it , let the danger light Upon your charter and your city's freedom .
So indeed he did .
What says the silver with her virgin hue ?
I do remember in this shepherd boy Some lively touches of my daughter's favor .
A very weak monster .
I will say nothing .
Thy false uncle , Dost thou attend me ?
Then there is no true lover in the forest , else sighing every minute and groaning every hour would detect the lazy foot of time as well as a clock .

My liege , here is a villain and a traitor , that , look your Grace , has struck the glove which your Majesty is take out of the helmet of Alencon .
So every bondman in his own hand bears The power to cancel his captivity .
But Antonio is certainly undone .
We'll burn his body in the holy place , And with the brands fire the traitors ' houses .
My mistress with a monster is in love .
Well , heaven's above all , and there be souls must be saved , and there be souls must not be saved .
Run , master , run .
What Conrade !
I am sorry that your leisure serves you not. , Antonio , gratify this gentleman , For in my mind you are much bound to him .
Tis fit we understand them .
Or wilt thou hunt ?
By running fast .
There is none of my uncle's marks upon you .
Less in your knowledge and your grace you show not Than our earth's wonder , more than earth divine .
Shine out , fair sun , till I have bought a glass , That I may see my shadow as I pass .
E'en at hand , alighted by this .
I found them on a tree .
You are my true and honorable wife , As dear to me as are the ruddy drops That visit my sad heart .

Nor I .
Sirrah , go see what trumpet 'tis that sounds .
Alack , sir , you can not see your way .
Give the word through .
Give me thy hand .
I'll tarry no longer with you .
Worthy Macbeth , we stay upon your leisure .
I have a suit to you .
A lover is more condoling .
Bids the winds blow the earth into the sea Or swell the curled water 'bove the main , That things might change or cease .
All for our vantage .
These are the forgeries of jealousy .
And I for no woman .
So please you , we will stand and watch your pleasure .
Pray you , avoid it .
A trusty villain , sir , that very oft , When I am dull with care and melancholy , Lightens my humor with his merry jests .

Ten masts at each make not the altitude Which thou hast perpendicularly fell .
Tis strange .
Thou hast obtained thy suit .
What is his strength by land ?
Nor stony tower , nor walls of beaten brass , Nor airless dungeon , nor strong links of iron Can be retentive to the strength of spirit .
If I know this , know all the world besides , That part of tyranny that I do bear I can shake off at pleasure .

Princes have but their titles for their glories , An outward honor for an inward toil ,
That's twice .
Most heartily I do beseech the court To give the judgment .

Worthy gentleman !

A good swift simile , but something currish .

Oh , do-de , do-de , do-de .
Now she holds me not .
Good e'en , good e'en .
Farewell , sweet playfellow .
No , forbear .
Thy luster thickens When he shines by .
And you by land .
Let's see .
Go to , go to .
If you'll sit down , I'll bear your logs the while .
Come , come away .

What , I will be jovial .
There thou mightst behold the great image of authority : a dog's obeyed in office .

I know you could not lack , I am certain on 't , Very necessity of this thought , that I , Your partner in the cause 'gainst which he fought , Could not with graceful eyes attend those wars Which fronted mine own peace .
Hark !
You spurn me hence , and he will spurn me hither .
Fortune is an excellent moral .
But , look you , Cassius , The angry spot doth glow on Caesar's brow , And all the rest look like a chidden train .
Speak once again .

He is now as valiant as Hercules that only tells a lie and swears it .
O bloody Richard !
What , household stuff ?
My lord ?
Let's see once more this saying graved in gold , "Who chooseth me shall gain what many men desire." Why , that's the lady .
Soon may I hear and see him .
I tell thee , man , 'tis better with me now Than when thou met'st me last where now we meet .
Fetch Desdemona hither .
For that you must But say I could not help it .
I hear his trumpet .
How foolish do your fears seem now , Calphurnia !
Why , see you not ?
That , sir , which I will not report after her .
Indeed , my lord , it followed hard upon .
Forbear to sleep the nights , and fast the days ; Compare dead happiness with living woe ; Think that thy babes were sweeter than they were , And he that slew them fouler than he is .
I know his heart .
Why , thou say'st true .
When thou dost ask me blessing , I'll kneel down And ask of thee forgiveness .
I could do more to do Antonius good , But 'twould offend him , and in his offense Should my performance perish .
I have been worth the whistle .
Make us thy ministers of chastisement , That we may praise thee in the victory !
Mend" me , thou saucy fellow ?
Once more unto the breach , dear friends , once more , Or close the wall up with our English dead !
Touching our person , seek we no revenge , But we our kingdom's safety must so tender , Whose ruin you have sought , that to her laws We do deliver you .
Heavens keep him from these beasts !
That will I do .
When came this to you ?
Most constantly .
Death of thy soul !
Whip him , fellows , Till like a boy , you see him cringe his face And whine aloud for mercy .
Who comes here ?
The other half Comes to the privy coffer of the state , And the offender's life lies in the mercy Of the Duke only 'gainst all other voice .
I am a very foolish fond old man , Fourscore and upward , not an hour more nor less .
Ay , Desdemona .
Pray , do not mock me .
My creditors grow cruel .
Let no such man be trusted .
Tis spoken well .
Nay , certainly , I have heard the Ptolemies' pyramises are very goodly things .
If ever thou come to me and say , after tomorrow , "This is my glove , " by this hand I will take thee a box on the ear .
I do desire it with all my heart , and I hope it is no dishonest desire to desire to be a woman of the world .
Meantime God grants that we have need of you .
Time shall unfold what plighted cunning hides , Who covers faults at last with shame derides .
If you would conjure in her , you must make a circle ; if conjure up Love in her in his true likeness , he must appear naked and blind .
What cheer , my love ? , Demetrius and Egeus , go along .
I had forgot the reward .
Do not break off so , For we may pity though not pardon thee .
Forever and a day .
Fare you well .
A Cornish name .
Oh , he has given example for our flight Most grossly by his own !
Orlando ?
At such a time I'll loose my daughter to him .

With duty and desire we follow you .
Oh , behold , The riches of the ship is come on shore !

He can report , As seemeth by his plight , of the revolt The newest state .
Realms and islands were As plates dropped from his pocket .

For first was he contract to Lady Lucy , Your mother lives a witness to that vow , And afterward by substitute betrothed To Bona , sister to the king of France .
Take it , brave York .
How say you by the French lord , Monsieur le Bon ?
Meantime we thank you for your well-took labor .
Therefore speak no more .
Then bid adieu to me , and say the tears Belong to Egypt .
To fright you thus methinks I am too savage ; To do worse to you were fell cruelty , Which is too nigh your person .
If we do meet again , we'll smile indeed .
What noise ?
And , Kate , when France is mine and I am yours , then yours is France and you are mine .
Your daughter here the princes left for dead .
Well , I say no .

He shall taste of my bottle .
I shifted him away And laid good 'scuses upon your ecstasy ,
She confesses it .
And out of doubt you do me now more wrong In making question of my uttermost Than if you had made waste of all I have .

The ground indeed is tawny .
I repent me much That so I harried him .
Bid them move away .

Tigers , not daughters , what have you performed ?
Why , or for what , the nobles were committed Is all unknown to me , my gracious lord .
That's one of them .
You are a fool. , You , niece , provide yourself .
The spirit of my father grows strong in me , and I will no longer endure it .
We will meet , and there we may rehearse most obscenely and courageously .
Such and so finely bolted didst thou seem .
Till I shall see you in your soldiers' dress , Which will become you both , farewell .
At our synagogue , Tubal .
And when he saw my best alarumed spirits , Bold in the quarrel's right , roused to the encounter , Or whether ghasted by the noise I made , Full suddenly he fled .
Either thou , Macbeth , Or else my sword with an unbattered edge I sheathe again undeeded .
Why , what make you here ?
Do you not hear him ?
I am an ass ; else it could never be But I should know her as well as she knows me .
I'll tell the news .
Are you not good ?
That I have , lady .
My reputation , Iago , my reputation !
Be certain , nothing truer .
Angels are bright still , though the brightest fell .
An if they live , I hope I need not fear .
But no metal can , No , not the hangman's axe , bear half the keenness Of thy sharp envy .
I shall , King Harry .
Sblood , do you think I am easier to be played on than a pipe ?
Here I kneel : If e'er my will did trespass 'gainst his love , Either in discourse of thought or actual deed , Or that mine eyes , mine ears , or any sense , Delighted them , or any other form , Or that I do not yet , and ever did ,
The castle's gently rendered .
You have done well by water .
But in my terms of honor I stand aloof , and will no reconcilement Till by some elder masters , of known honor , I have a voice and precedent of peace To keep my name ungored .
Hang him instantly .
Richard of York , how fares our loving brother ?
Tis a subject for a sovereign to reason on , and for a sovereign's sovereign to ride on , and for the world , familiar to us and unknown , to lay apart their particular functions and wonder at him .
But as 'tis , We can not miss him .
A heavy sight !
She was , good Curtis , before this frost .
I might ask you for your commission , but I do take thee , Orlando , for my husband .

Was ever man so 'rayed ?
Let him come when he will , I will deny thee nothing .
To thee , that hast nor honesty nor grace .
No cause , no cause .
Ne'er a fantastical knave of them all shall flout me out of my calling .
She ate no meat today , nor none shall eat .
I will speak to this fellow. , Whose grave's this , sirrah ?
No blown ambition doth our arms incite , But love , dear love ! , and our aged father's right .
In such a night as this !
Send the deed after me , And I will sign it .
Farewell .
Help , ho !
Show me the place .
Good madam , patience .
Lord Mayor , the reason we have sent , Look back !
O Iras , Charmian !
Therefore wast thou Deservedly confined into this rock , Who hadst deserved more than a prison .
And , Demetrius , The more you beat me , I will fawn on you .
For my brother , I think he holds you well , and in dearness of heart hath holp to effect your ensuing marriage , surely suit ill spent and labor ill bestowed .
The time is free .
Marry , here's grace and a codpiece , that's a wise man and a fool .
Go in with me , and I will tell you my drift .
Hark .
A good direction , warlike sovereign .
Am I myself ?
So we grew together , Like to a double cherry , seeming parted But yet an union in partition , Two lovely berries molded on one stem ;
But I do see you're moved .
I did not , gentle husband , lock thee forth .
Strike , I say !
Amen , amen to that fair prayer , say I .
Will you yield and this avoid Or , guilty in defense , be thus destroyed ?
That you shall surely find him , Lead to the Sagittary the raised search , And there will I be with him .
But in your daughter's womb I bury them , Where , in that nest of spicery , they will breed Selves of themselves , to your recomforture .
So befall my soul As this is false he burdens me withal .
O Fates , come , come , Cut thread and thrum .
My father's loss , the weakness which I feel , The wrack of all my friends , nor this man's threats , To whom I am subdued , are but light to me , Might I but through my prison once a day Behold this maid .
This fortification , gentlemen , shall we see 't ?
In such a night Did pretty Jessica , like a little shrew , Slander her love , and he forgave it her .

Get you to bed on th ' instant , I will be returned Forthwith .

You cloudy princes and heart-sorrowing peers That bear this heavy mutual load of moan , Now cheer each other in each other's love .
Though others have the arm , show us the sleeve ; We in your motion turn , and you may move us .
The skin is good for your broken coxcomb .
Stay , stand apart .
God and our good cause fight upon our side .
I am agreed , and would I had given him the best horse inv Padua to begin his wooing that would thoroughly woo her , wed her , and bed her , and rid the house of her !
How came she by that light ?
A friendly eye could never see such faults .
This house is little .
But if you fail , without more speech , my lord , You must be gone from hence immediately .
Then be your eyes the witness of their evil .
We wait upon your Grace .
All strange and terrible events are welcome , But comforts we despise .
No , Messala .
Their ships are yare , yours , heavy .
O most happy hour !
Who knows not that the gentle duke is dead ?
A king , a king !
Nay , you must name his name , and half his face must be seen through the lion's neck .
It did always seem so to us .
I have charged thee not to haunt about my doors .
If you grow foul with me , Pistol , I will scour you with my rapier , as I may , in fair terms .
What was your dream , my lord ?
Reserve them till a merrier hour than this .
Sir , this should be answered .
Ambition should be made of sterner stuff .
His highness is not well .
Gentle Octavia , Let your best love draw to that point which seeks Best to preserve it .
I will give thee mine .
Your letters did withhold our breaking forth Till we perceived both how you were wrong led And we in negligent danger .
And be a happy mother by the deed .
Swart like my shoe , but her face nothing like so clean kept .
When you are gentle , you shall have one too , And not till then .
Go , you wild bedfellow , you can not soothsay .
I dare avouch it , sir .
Here , sir , but trouble him not .
Tis time to part .
Do all men kill the things they do not love ?
Both your majesties Might , by the sovereign power you have of us , Put your dread pleasures more into command Than to entreaty .
Let him come , and kindly .
I say amen to her .
No , he hath simply the best wit of any handicraft man in Athens .
Still through the hawthorn blows the cold wind , says , "Suum , mun , nonny." Dauphin my boy , my boy , cessez .
He'll watch the horologe a double set If drink rock not his cradle .
Most mighty Caesar , let me know some cause , Lest I be laughed at when I tell them so .
Good night .
I can live no longer by thinking .
You sent me for a rope's end as soon .
Oh , there has been much throwing about of brains .
What harmony is this ?
Then let the trumpets sound The tucket sonance and the note to mount , For our approach shall so much dare the field That England shall couch down in fear and yield .
He's of the color of the nutmeg .
Peace yet again .
A poor unfortunate beggar .
Read it , Mark Antony !
Would not they speak ?
You cram these words into mine ears against The stomach of my sense .
Tom , away !
Why do you stay so long , my lords of France ?
Well , as time shall try .
Where do you dwell ?
And as I say , retire with me to my lodging , from whence I will fitly bring you to hear my lord speak .
These three world-sharers , these competitors , Are in thy vessel .
Those that will hear me speak , let 'em stay here .
Will you to Scone ?
Traverse , go , provide thy money .
Ay , be so , good Touchstone .
The will !
Let it be so .
Change you color ?
Come , go with me ; Under our tents I'll play the eavesdropper To see if any mean to shrink from me .
What , i ' th ' storm , i ' th ' night ?
In God's name , what art thou ?
I fear 'tis choleric .
I must attend on Caesar .
I doubt not that , since we are well-persuaded We carry not a heart with us from hence That grows not in a fair consent with ours , Nor leave not one behind that doth not wish Success and conquest to attend on us .
Thou sing'st sweet music .
I shall do well .
But are you so much in love as your rhymes speak ?
All the conspirators save only he Did that they did in envy of great Caesar .
Oh , they are our friends .
And be all traitors that do so ?
For God's sake , a pot of small ale .
For this time I will leave you .
Now is it time to arm .
Their mastiffs are of unmatchable courage .
Here , sir !
It seems he hath great care to please his wife .
Give me mine angle .
He's no standard .
Let him alone .
Here we .
If Cleopatra heard you , your reproof Were well deserved of rashness .
I will to Venice .
What friend ?
He can not be heard of .
I am much bound to you .
Soft , no haste .
My own flesh and blood to rebel !
How will you live ?
Take note , take note , O world , To be direct and honest is not safe .
Let no fair be kept in mind But the fair of Rosalind .
Come .
It waves me forth again .
I do lack some part Of that quick spirit that is in Antony .
We must starve our sight From lovers ' food till morrow deep midnight .
The sun will not be seen today .
Double , double toil and trouble , Fire burn , and cauldron bubble .
Shed thou no blood , nor cut thou less nor more But just a pound of flesh .
Therefore , dear Isis , keep decorum , and fortune him accordingly .
Again !
Though for myself alone I would not be ambitious in my wish To wish myself much better , yet for you I would be trebled twenty times myself , A thousand times more fair , ten thousand times more rich , That only to stand high in your account I might in virtue , beauties , livings , friends Exceed account .
The revenges we are bound to take upon your traitorous father are not fit for your beholding .
Tis very grievous to be thought upon .
I will read it. , How much unlike art thou to Portia !
Makest thou this shame thy pastime ?
If not , why then this parting was well made .
So tell them , Publius .
O these deliberate fools !
Why sinks that cauldron ?
Your eyes do menace me .
You rise to play and go to bed to work .
Farewell !
Love ?
Nor I .
But he comes armed in his fortune and prevents the slander of his wife .
With all my heart. , Some three or four of you Go give him courteous conduct to this place. , Meantime the court shall hear Bellario's letter .
Thou art a fool .
In Venice they do let God see the pranks They dare not show their husbands .
Thou know'st that Banquo , and his Fleance , lives .
I warrant your honor .
There's some conceit or other likes him well When that he bids good morrow with such spirit .
Be thou a spirit of health or goblin damned , Bring with thee airs from heaven or blasts from hell , Be thy intents wicked or charitable , Thou comest in such a questionable shape That I will speak to thee .
You are welcome .
Ay , it stands so that I may hardly tarry so long .
Come , come , do you think I do not know you by your excellent wit ?
We'll bury him , and then , what's brave , what's noble , Let's do 't after the high Roman fashion And make death proud to take us .
Nor know I aught But that he's well and will be shortly here .
How , my pretty York ?
I am not Stephano , but a cramp .
Known unto these , and to myself disguised !
I will go seek him. , Cassio , walk hereabout .
We shall chide downright , if I longer stay .
You are a fishmonger .
Wherefore !
Tis not the king that sends you to the Tower .
We have store to do 't , And they have earned the waste .
Now gods that we adore , whereof comes this ?
Oh !
Go with me , And in the breath of bitter words let's smother My damned son that thy two sweet sons smothered .
And I do with an eye of love requite her .
Carry me to the jail ?
I can not speak enough of this content .
Sweet lord , if your lordship were at leisure , I should impart a thing to you from His Majesty .
My lord .
I gave him the stuff .
First , there is the Neapolitan prince .
You take my house when you do take the prop That doth sustain my house .
Here therefore for a while I will remain .
How malicious is my fortune , that I must repent to be just !
I remember a mass of things , but nothing distinctly .
How now , daughter and cousin ?
What think'st thou , will our friends prove all true ?
Or is your gold and silver ewes and rams ?
Wherefore ?
Signior Montano , Your trusty and most valiant servitor , With his free duty recommends you thus , And prays you to believe him .
Dearly my delicate Ariel .
O , help him , you sweet heavens !
Now , I'll stand to it , the pancakes were naught and the mustard was good , and yet was not the knight forsworn .
Let me beseech your grace not to do so .
Know of your youth .
But though I am a daughter to his blood , I am not to his manners .
Did 't not wake you ?
Alas , what cry is that ?
Let me see , what think you of falling in love ?
We do not know .
Provoke him that he may .
So all .
Think you of a worse title , and I will fit her to it .
Ready .
That eye that told you so looked but asquint .
My lord , most humbly on my knee I beg The leading of the vaward .
Witness you That he is borne about invisible .
Therefore be patient .
If you do love me you will find me out. , Nerissa and the rest , stand all aloof .
And so do I .
Why have you stol'n upon us thus ?
Go thrust him out at gates , and let him smell His way to Dover .
I did not think , sir , to have met you here .
Sometime am I All wound with adders who with cloven tongues Do hiss me into madness .
Ah , Tranio , what a cruel father's he !
Art thou aught else but place , degree , and form , Creating awe and fear in other men , Wherein thou art less happy , being feared , Than they in fearing ?
Tomorrow night when Phoebe doth behold Her silver visage in the watery glass , Decking with liquid pearl the bladed grass ( A time that lovers ' flights doth still conceal ) , Through Athens ' gates have we devised to steal .
I do never use it .
You must not think I am so simple but I know the devil himself will not eat a woman .
Why , the enemy is loud .
We have kissed away Kingdoms and provinces .
Even as men wracked upon a sand , that look to be washed off the next tide .
I will deserve your pains .
I pray you , choose another subject .
I promise you , my soul is very jocund In the remembrance of so fair a dream .
Ay , marry , must you .
Nor would we deign him burial of his men Till he disbursed at Saint Colme's Inch Ten thousand dollars to our general use .
This ring , good sir , alas , it is a trifle .
All ports I'll bar .
Uncharitably with me have you dealt , And shamefully my hopes by you are butchered .
Nay , when I have a suit Wherein I mean to touch your love indeed It shall be full of poise and difficult weight And fearful to be granted .
And thou must make a dullard of the world , If they not thought the profits of my death Were very pregnant and potential spirits To make thee seek it." O strange and fastened villain !
I see a woman may be made a fool If she had not a spirit to resist .
Do we so .
I understand moreover , upon the Rialto , he hath a third at Mexico , a fourth for England , and other ventures he hath squandered abroad .
I'll run from thee and hide me in the brakes , And leave thee to the mercy of wild beasts .
Yet I love thee too .
O my lord , my lord , Forgive my fearful sails !
Stay !
Oh , that your Highness knew my heart in this : I never loved my brother in my life .

Therefore , O Antony , stay not by his side .
To die , to sleep .
There lies your love .

Petruchio , go thy ways ; the field is won .
Your heart is burst , you have lost half your soul .
He brushes his hat o ' mornings .

Make me not offended In your distrust .
Till that , I'll view the manners of the town , Peruse the traders , gaze upon the buildings , And then return and sleep within mine inn , For with long travel I am stiff and weary .
Welcome , destruction , blood , and massacre .
Who is it in the press that calls on me ?
Tis he .

What should I do ?
Oh !
Bid him set on his powers betimes before , And we will follow .
That "sort" was well fished for .
Come hither , good Volumnius .
There's meaning in thy snores .
Crown him that , And then I grant we put a sting in him That at his will he may do danger with .
Only give me leave , Unworthy as I am , to follow you .

I will bestow you where you shall have time To speak your bosom freely .
Husband , let's follow to see the end of this ado .
Say , is your tardy master now at hand ?
Follow" ?
But if thou diest before I come , thou art a mocker of my labor .
But ere they came , -O , let me say no more !
What should I say to you ?

No wonder , my lord .
My news I might have told hereafter .

At your kind'st leisure .
Come the next sabbath , and I will content you .
Brother , I advise you to the best .
How cheerest thou , Jessica ?
Look you , if you take the matter otherwise than is meant , Captain Macmorris , peradventure I shall think you do not use me with that affability as , in discretion , you ought to use me , look you , being as good a man as yourself , both in the disciplines of war and in the derivation of my birth and in other particularities .

What shall become of this ?
You have little cause to say so .
Ay , sweet Rosalind .
Play with your fancies and in them behold , Upon the hempen tackle , shipboys climbing .

Edward Plantagenet , why art thou dead ?
Your Honor's players , hearing your amendment , Are come to play a pleasant comedy , For so your doctors hold it very meet , Seeing too much sadness hath congealed your blood , And melancholy is the nurse of frenzy .
Urge neither charity nor shame to me .
We'll wait upon your lordship .
Is Clarence dead ?
Heaven would that she these gifts should have And I to live and die her slave .

But , sir , forgive me , Since my becomings kill me when they do not Eye well to you .
Thou art sure of me .
How fares my lord ?
Meantime , have patience .
Why did you so cry out , sirs , in your sleep ?
Tis vile , unless it may be quaintly ordered , And better in my mind not undertook .

Presently away , For to strange sores strangely they strain the cure. , Come , lady , die to live .
Follow my mother .

Do , good friend .
Yours by this hand .
Say to the king I would attend his leisure For a few words .
Did you say all ?
By Jove , I am not covetous for gold Nor care I who doth feed upon my cost ; It yearns me not if men my garments wear ; Such outward things dwell not in my desires .
Yes , faith .
Who , I ?
Long stayed he so .
Caesar doth bear me hard , but he loves Brutus .
Oh , that a man might know The end of this day's business ere it come !
What is 't o'clock ?
The king , sir , hath wagered with him six Barbary horses , against the which he has impawned , as I take it , six French rapiers and poniards with their assigns , as girdle , hangers , and so .
Othello ?
Your charm so strongly works 'em That if you now beheld them , your affections Would become tender .

Tell me what more thou know'st .
Give me your neaf , Monsieur Mustardseed .
Fled this way , sir , when by no means he could , Pursue him , ho !
Why , this is a more exquisite song than the other .

May it be done ?

Be angry when you will , it shall have scope .
Come , come and take a queen Worth many babes and beggars !
Nay , by Saint Jamy , I hold you a penny , A horse and a man Is more than one And yet not many .
Nay , not sound , I pray you .
But , my good lord , Wherefore should you do this ?
Oh , dispatch me !
But then the mind much sufferance doth o'erskip When grief hath mates and bearing fellowship .
We are men , my liege .
O thou public commoner !
Nay , it is possible enough to judgment .
Madam , sleeps still .
Wherein went he ?
I'll never care what wickedness I do , If this man come to good .
Well , well , well .
How durst you , villains , bring it from the dresser And serve it thus to me that love it not ?

No , not a denier .
In my school days , when I had lost one shaft , I shot his fellow of the selfsame flight The selfsame way with more advised watch To find the other forth , and by adventuring both , I oft found both .
Would I had two coxcombs and two daughters .
Tis well you offer it behind her back .
No , by this heavenly light !
The "fiery" duke ?
But that thy strange mutations make us hate thee , Life would not yield to age .
And I .
O sun , thy uprise shall I see no more .
Is he not approved in the height a villain , that hath slandered , scorned , dishonored my kinswoman ?
Thou canst not .
Brother Anthony ,
Alas , how shall this bloody deed be answered ?
For he loves to hear That unicorns may be betrayed with trees , And bears with glasses , elephants with holes , Lions with toils , and men with flatterers .
And so am I for Rosalind .
No further , sir .
How now , what news ?
Where is thy luster now ?
I would do much T ' atone them , for the love I bear to Cassio .
It is both he and she : Your son and daughter .
Truly , the tree yields bad fruit .
I give it you .
Bring the villain forth .
Go to , go to. , Come hither , sir .
Say what , is Horatio there ?
Do this suddenly , And let not search and inquisition quail To bring again these foolish runaways .
What is this same ?
What was 't That moved pale Cassius to conspire ?
Knock , knock , knock !
Here's the manner of 't : I' th' marketplace , on a tribunal silvered , Cleopatra and himself in chairs of gold Were publicly enthroned .
Or he that slew her brothers and her uncles ?
You are not Pinch's patient , are you , sir ?
How now , my lord ?
That's my brave lord !
But there the Duke was given to understand That in a gondola were seen together Lorenzo and his amorous Jessica .
What said he ?
Oh , did he so ?
Why so , being gone , Why so , being gone , I am a man again .
I give away myself for you and dote upon the exchange .
But notwithstanding , haste .
Good .
Then stand with us .
Madam , do you .
Our fears in Banquo Stick deep , and in his royalty of nature Reigns that which would be feared .
What , are we cuckolds ere we have deserved it ?
My lord , your promise for the earldom , Richmond !
And wherefore doth Lysander Deny your love , so rich within his soul , And tender me , forsooth , affection , But by your setting on , by your consent ?
Look !
She , dying , gave it me And bid me , when my fate would have me wived , To give it her .
How much I had to do to calm his rage !
O Regan , she hath tied Sharp-toothed unkindness , like a vulture , here .
The mighty gods defend thee !
The odds is gone , And there is nothing left remarkable Beneath the visiting moon .
I say unto thee , I bid thy master cutout the gown , but I did not bid him cut it to pieces .
Four legs and two voices , a most delicate monster .
He is married ?
When I know the gentleman , I'll tell him what you say .
Peace , Grumio .
Our yoke and sufferance show us womanish .
Oh , I followed that I blush to look upon !
Is not marriage honorable in a beggar ?
Tis monstrous .
Ay , and said nothing but what I protest intendment of doing .
I looked not for you yet , nor am provided For your fit welcome .
Our fortune lies Upon this jump .
But it shall not be so long ; this wrestler shall clear all .
Find out this villain , Edmund .
No occupation .
Do you love me ?
There is no love in you .
Oh , now , who will behold The royal captain of this ruined band
I fear my Thisbe's promise is forgot ! , And thou , O Wall , O sweet , O lovely Wall , That stand'st between her father's ground and mine .
Madam , he's married to Octavia .
He will keep that good name still .
There's the point .
Was that done like Cassius ?
I am weary of you .
Many will swoon when they do look on blood .
Did Cicero say anything ?
You must sing This nothing's more than matter .
He is drunk now .
Thou drunken slave , I sent thee for a rope And told thee to what purpose and what end .
Or if thou hast not sat as I do now , Wearying thy hearer in thy mistress's praise , Thou hast not loved .
You will answer , "The slaves are ours." So do I answer you .
Montjoy .
Go to , you are too shrewd .
I can not tell ; I think not .
A sight most pitiful in the meanest wretch , Past speaking of in a king .
To him will I .
No , I pray thee speak in sober judgment .
And tell the Dauphin His jest will savor but of shallow wit When thousands weep more than did laugh at it .
What were his marks ?
First , as you know , my house within the city Is richly furnished with plate and gold , Basins and ewers to lave her dainty hands ; My hangings all of Tyrian tapestry , In ivory coffers I have stuffed my crowns , In cypress chests my arras counterpoints , Costly apparel , tents , and canopies , Fine linen , Turkey cushions bossed with pearl , Valance of Venice gold in needlework , Pewter and brass , and all things that belong To house or housekeeping .
If you mark Alexander's life well , Harry of Monmouth's life is come after it indifferent well , for there is figures in all things .
Fare you well .
You were best to tell Antonio what you hear , Yet do not suddenly , for it may grieve him .
The residue of your fortune Go to my cave and tell me. , Good old man , Thou art right welcome as thy master is .
Shall I attend your Grace ?
Into what dangers would you lead me , Cassius , That you would have me seek into myself For that which is not in me ?
Oh , that his fault should make a knave of thee , That art not what th' art sure of !
What dost thou say ?
Good madam , be not angry with the child .
If any , speak , for him have I offended .
Go after .
Oh , a thousand thousand times , and then of so gentle a condition !
Tomorrow with your earliest Let me have speech with you. , Come , my dear love , The purchase made , the fruits are to ensue : That profit's yet to come 'tween me and you .
But , soft !
For the Dauphin , I stand here for him .
Pinion him like a thief , bring him before us .
The villain shall not 'scape .
I am one , sir , that comes to tell you your daughter and the Moor are now making the beast with two backs .
Not in my husband's nose .
Thy husband knew it all .
Godspeed , fair Helena !
And in assemblies too .
Speak to us .
Your praise is come too swiftly home before you .
If Hamlet give the first or second hit Or quit in answer of the third exchange , Let all the battlements their ordnance fire !
Why , here's no crab , and therefore look not sour .
That will I , for I must bear answer back How you excuse my brother , Rosalind .
Yare , yare , good Iras , quick .
Should I not say , "Hath a dog money ?
I could never better stead thee than now .
Kill men i ' th ' dark !
Who wrongs him ?
With one fool's head I came to woo , But I go away with two. , Sweet , adieu .
The money that you owe me for the chain .
Well moused , Lion !
His grace speaks cheerfully .
I will o'erlook thy paper .
I would kiss before I spoke .
Sit down a while And let us once again assail your ears , That are so fortified against our story , What we have two nights seen .
Here , noble lord .
Art thou some god , some angel , or some devil That makest my blood cold and my hair to stare ?
I will discharge thee ere I go from thee .
The same .
A dream itself is but a shadow .
I have years on my back forty- eight .
For certain , sir , he is not .
O thou foul thief , where hast thou stowed my daughter ?
No , Pompey , I have kept me from the cup .
His better doth not breathe upon the earth .
Kneel not , gentle Portia .
And there assume some other horrible form , Which might deprive your sovereignty of reason And draw you into madness ?
Stanley , he is your wife's son .
Yes , by Saint Patrick , but there is , Horatio , And much offense too .
Tis bitter cold , And I am sick at heart .
Lord , how art thou changed !
Now , by my holidam , here comes Katherina !
Good husband , come home presently .
I have done no harm .
Will it eat me ?
I am no villain .
Thus hath the course of justice whirled about And left thee but a very prey to time , Having no more but thought of what thou wast To torture thee the more , being what thou art .
Look , how she rubs her hands .
All this is so , but what of this , my lord ?
Then call we this the field of Agincourt , Fought on the day of Crispin Crispianus .
A most poor credulous monster. , Well drawn , monster , in good sooth !
Here's Cassio hurt by villains .
Your statue spouting blood in many pipes , In which so many smiling Romans bathed , Signifies that from you great Rome shall suck Reviving blood , and that great men shall press For tinctures , stains , relics , and cognizance .
But we are spirits of another sort .
I am not guilty of Lysander's blood .
From this time Such I account thy love .
I will confess it to all the 'orld .
General , be advised , He comes to bad intent .
Gone ?
Lo thee !
Call him hither , good Monsieur Le Beau .
Hie you , Messala , And I will seek for Pindarus the while .
Nay , and most like .
Good sir , be a man , Think every bearded fellow that's but yoked May draw with you .
Why , that's my dainty Ariel .
The gods are just , and of our pleasant vices Make instruments to plague us .
Tis said they eat each other .
Back , slave , or I will break thy pate across .
Be patient , for you shall remain with us .
Yes , Shylock , I will seal unto this bond .
Mend your speech a little , Lest you may mar your fortunes .
Withdraw thee , wretched Margaret .
Why , what else ?
Give me your blessing .
The mighty dukes , Gloucester and Buckingham .
I say a devil .
And most poor matters Point to rich ends .
How is 't , brother !
Sir , his chests and treasure He has not with him .
Oh , widow Dido ?
To find out you .
So is he now in execution Of any bold or noble enterprise , However he puts on this tardy form .
Yea , or to paint himself ?
Ram thou thy fruitful tidings in mine ears , That long time have been barren .
I do suspect I have done some offense That seems disgracious in the city's eye , And that you come to reprehend my ignorance .
I'll to England .
Now from head to foot I am marble-constant .
Farewell .
My love thou art , my love , I think .
Portia is dead .
Out o ' your wits and hearing too ?
You'll heat my blood .
I would be loath to have you overflown with a honey bag , signor .
Happy is your Grace , That can translate the stubbornness of fortune Into so quiet and so sweet a style .
Well , sir , good night .
Thy dukedom I resign and do entreat Thou pardon me my wrongs .
Why , this fellow has banished two on 's daughters , and did the third a blessing against his will .
O sweet mistress , speak !
Therefore , patiently and yielding .
Naught's had , all's spent , Where our desire is got without content .
Let us to the great supper .
How now , how now ?
Company is coming here .
What , wilt thou flout me thus unto my face , Being forbid ?
By my troth , a pleasant-spirited lady .
Wouldst thou have that Which thou esteem'st the ornament of life , And live a coward in thine own esteem , Letting "I dare not" wait upon "I would , " Like the poor cat i ' th ' adage ?
Methought I had , and often did I strive To yield the ghost , but still the envious flood Stopped in my soul and would not let it forth To find the empty , vast , and wand'ring air , But smothered it within my panting bulk , Who almost burst to belch it in the sea .
Your betters , sir .
If thy revengeful heart can not forgive , Lo , here I lend thee this sharp-pointed sword , Which if thou please to hide in this true breast And let the soul forth that adoreth thee , I lay it naked to the deadly stroke And humbly beg the death upon my knee .
You were the word of war .
I doubt it is no other but the main : His father's death and our o'erhasty marriage .
I'll strike and cry , "Take all." Well said .
My services to your lordship .
Where is she ?
But , as I can learn , He hearkens after prophecies and dreams , And from the crossrow plucks the letter And says a wizard told him that by "G" His issue disinherited should be .
A vengeance on your crafty withered hide !
The more my wrong , the more his spite appears .
Tell her the king , that may command , entreats , That , at her hands , which the king's King forbids .
I am sorry for my cousin .
Hence with your little ones .
For with throwing thus my head , Dogs leap the hatch , and all are fled .
Till then , lead thou first .
How much better is it to weep at joy than to joy at weeping !
I arrest thee of high treason , by the name of Richard , Earl of Cambridge .
Done to death by slanderous tongues Was the Hero that here lies .
Well , all is one .
This is a slave whose easy borrowed pride Dwells in the fickle grace of her he follows. , Out , varlet , from my sight !
Is 't possible ?
I am the second son of old Sir Rowland , That bring these tidings to this fair assembly .
Her fallow leas The darnel , hemlock , and rank fumitory Doth root upon , while that the coulter rusts That should deracinate such savagery .
What masque , what music ?
She was the wife of Caius Marcellus .
And thus she means , videlicet , Asleep , my love ?
Sir , you are very welcome to our house .
Peace , ho !
You wrong me every way .
I will only be bold with Benedick for his company , for from the crown of his head to the sole of his foot he is all mirth .
The old man's daughter told us all .
An there be any matter of weight chances , call up me .
Take up my mistress ' gown to his master's use !
How now , Horatio ?
I have no great devotion to the deed And yet he hath given me satisfying reasons .
All blessed secrets , All you unpublished virtues of the earth , Spring with my tears .
Hast thou forgot The foul witch Sycorax , who with age and envy Was grown into a hoop ?
Your names ?
Come .
Not one , my lord .
You shall not go , my lord .
There's no time for a man to recover his hair that grows bald by nature .
Let him fly far .
I had as lief have my mistress a jade .
Go with me and see What I can show in this .
For even out of that will I cause these of Cyprus to mutiny , whose qualification shall come into no true taste again but by the displanting of Cassio .
My Lord Bassanio , since you have found Antonio , We two will leave you .
How canst thou woo her ?
If thou dost I shall never love thee after .
Then love me , Rosalind .
His eyes were green as leeks .
I am glad on 't .
Without , my lord ; guarded , to know your pleasure .
What did you mean by that same handkerchief you gave me even now ?
No , boy .
And lawfully by this the Jew may claim A pound of flesh to be by him cut off Nearest the merchant's heart. , Be merciful .
Is he not light of brain ?
O , remember , God , To hear her prayer for them , as now for us !
You may tell every finger I have with my ribs .
Locked in her monument .
But my uncle-father and aunt-mother are deceived .
Then , at my farm I have a hundred milch-kine to the pail , Six score fat oxen standing in my stalls , And all things answerable to this portion .
Sir , sir , be patient .
And to that end , sir , I will welcome you .
Not th' imperious show Of the full-fortuned Caesar ever shall Be brooched with me .
Nor I .
And I will sing it in the latter end of a play before the duke .
Good morrow , neighbor Gremio. , God save you , gentlemen !
would you create me new ?
An if the wind blow any way from shore , I will not harbor in this town tonight .
The spirits that know All mortal consequences have pronounced me thus : "Fear not , Macbeth .
He's dead and rotten .
O Antony , Thou mine of bounty , how wouldst thou have paid My better service , when my turpitude Thou dost so crown with gold !
Ay , my lord .
I'll be sworn , if thou be Launcelot , thou art mine own flesh and blood .
Come , come , you're drunk .
Now is the time of help .
Dromio , thou , Dromio , thou snail , thou slug , thou sot .
He bears too great a mind .
These things sting His mind so venomously that burning shame Detains him from Cordelia .
I had rather be a country servant-maid Than a great queen with this condition , To be so baited , scorned , and stormed at .
I arrest thee of high treason , by the name of Thomas Grey , knight , of Northumberland .
Will you be married , motley ?
There be land rats and water rats , water thieves and land thieves , I mean pirates , and then there is the peril of waters , winds , and rocks .
Of what your reverence shall incite us to .
Take thy forfeiture .
Now is the winter of our discontent Made glorious summer by this son of York , And all the clouds that loured upon our house In the deep bosom of the ocean buried .
Oh , the difference of man and man !
And then the boy , his clerk , That took some pains in writing , he begged mine .
Tis well .
Sir , my liege , Do not infest your mind with beating on The strangeness of this business .
Nay , good , be patient .
I do not know dat .
To take the widow Exasperates , makes mad her sister Goneril , And hardly shall I carry out my side , Her husband being alive .
The wood of Birnam .
Love wrought these miracles .
He is a sick man that would speak with you .
Chill not let go , zir , without vurther 'casion .
I do .
I would have blowed up the town , so Chrish save me , la , in an hour .
mutinies , in countries discord , in palaces treason , and the bond cracked 'twixt son and father .
Your crown's awry .
And ever will , though he do shake me off To beggarly divorcement , love him dearly , Comfort forswear me !
Think it no more .
Read it .
She now shall be my sister , not my wife .
To thee a woman's services are due .
Fare you well , Jessica .
Who hath relieved you ?
Holla !
Light !
For often , with a solemn earnestness , More than indeed belonged to such a trifle , He begged of me to steal it .
Come not near Casca .
I think it lacks of twelve .
Nothing .
Oh , help , ho !
Of what kind should this cock come of ?
And may , but how ?
Then he is dead ?
Of it own color too .
They say you are a melancholy fellow .
Go you to him from me .
I will seek Some way to leave him .
Now , sweet lord , You know the goodness I intend upon you .
Sir , know you this glove ?
By my soul I swear There is no power in the tongue of man To alter me .
Lend me a looking-glass .
Use your authority .
It is a nipping and an eager air .
If he be so resolved , I can o'ersway him .
If you come slack of former services , You shall do well .
I durst , my lord , to wager she is honest , Lay down my soul at stake .
Mark Antony , Pardon me , Caius Cassius .
Thou hast a lady far more beautiful Than any woman in this waning age .
Come , some music !
They are incensed .
She shall be buried by her Antony .
Nay , an thou canst not smile as the wind sits , thou'lt catch cold shortly .
I never saw a woman , But only Sycorax my dam and she .
Faith , here's an English tailor come hither for stealing out of a French hose .
It fell upon a little western flower , Before milk-white , now purple with love's wound .
Either be patient and entreat me fair , Or with the clamorous report of war Thus will I drown your exclamations .
And so am I , being else by faith enforced To call young Claudio to a reckoning for it .
Didst thou not hear a noise ?
I spoke with some of the sailors that escaped the wrack .
Tut , tut , thou art all ice ; thy kindness freezes .
I know you by the waggling of your head .
Chill pick your teeth , zir .
O excellent young man !
I am bid forth to supper , Jessica .
Therefore , my sweet Rose , my dear Rose , be merry .
Do it at once , Or thy precedent services are all But accidents unpurposed .
I'll wear none but this .
Are you acquainted with the difference That holds this present question in the court ?
You are gentlemen of brave mettle .
Of the king's ship , The mariners , say how thou hast disposed , And all the rest o ' th ' fleet .
Ghastly looks Are at my service , like enforced smiles , And both are ready in their offices , At any time to grace my stratagems .
Oh , do not wish one more !
I wish you all joy of the worm .
Madam , his majesty doth call for you , , And for your Grace , , and yours , my gracious lords .
Methinks I do .
I know you what you are , And like a sister am most loath to call Your faults as they are named .
For Hamlet and the trifling of his favor , Hold it a fashion and a toy in blood , A violet in the youth of primy nature , Forward , not permanent , sweet , not lasting , The perfume and suppliance of a minute .
Oh , pardon me , Signior Gremio , I would fain be doing .
That nature , which contemns its origin Can not be bordered certain in itself .
We'll see our husbands Before they think of us .
Let witchcraft join with beauty , lust with both .
Went they not quickly , I should die with laughing .
Tis very true .
Pay him six thousand and deface the bond !
There's mine .
By Jupiter , This shall not be revoked .
Ay , I do .
Where's Publius ?
From Silvius , sir .
Tis even so .
One Hero died defiled , but I do live , And surely as I live , I am a maid .
I must go in .
They have not been commanded , mighty king .
Nay , then , thou mock'st me .
Our fortune on the sea is out of breath And sinks most lamentably .
Tis he .
Let this pernicious hour Stand aye accursed in the calendar !
Fie , there is no such man .
Is this certain ?
Oh , you and I have heard our fathers say , There was a Brutus once that would have brooked Th ' eternal devil to keep his state in Rome As easily as a king .
Let me tell you , Cassius , you yourself Are much condemned to have an itching palm , To sell and mart your offices for gold To undeservers .
Or that I had any friend would be a man for my sake !
For the one , I have neither words nor measure ; and for the other , I have no strength in measure , yet a reasonable measure in strength .
Or here , or at the Capitol .
Tomorrow morning come you to my house , And since you could not be my son-in-law , Be yet my nephew .
Hark , canst thou hear me ?
Oh , what authority and show of truth Can cunning sin cover itself withal !
For God's sake , hold your hands .
I confess two sleeves .
Caesar , I bring thee word Menecrates and Menas , famous pirates , Make the sea serve them , which they ear and wound With keels of every kind .
I protest I love thee .
What noise ?
What , were you snarling all before I came , Ready to catch each other by the throat , And turn you all your hatred now on me ?
Is the king stirring , worthy thane ?
If you do sorrow at my grief in love , By giving love your sorrow and my grief Were both extermined .
Fare thee well at once .
Therefore , Go , clear thy crystals. , Yoke-fellows in arms , Let us to France , like horse-leeches , my boys , To suck , to suck , the very blood to suck .
This is the silliest stuff that ever I heard .
I pray you , Let not my jealousies be your dishonors , But mine own safeties .
Certainly , sir , I can .
This is the man , this is Antonio , To whom I am so infinitely bound .
It must be your imagination then , and not theirs .
Ay , ay .
Is 't gone ?
Haply a woman's voice may do some good , When articles too nicely urged be stood on .
What handkerchief ?
Ay , leeks is good .
I myself heard the king say he would not be ransomed .
Nay , I have done .
Let us toward the king .
Farewell .
Well , I'll end the song. , Sirs , cover the while ; the duke will drink under this tree. , He hath been all this day to look you .
It seemed she was a queen Over her passion , who , most rebel-like , Sought to be king o'er her .
The urging of that word "judgment" hath bred a kind of remorse in me .
Sailors , my lord , they say .
Say it is done , And I will love thee and prefer thee for it .
I'll none now .
Regan , I think you are .
Hail , king !
An if he be not fought withal , my lord , Let us not live in France .
Give me any gage of thine , and I will wear it in my bonnet .
A good matter , surely .
Not very well , but I have met him oft , And he hath bought the cottage and the bounds That the old carlot once was master of .
Bid them all fly , For when I am revenged upon my charm , I have done all .
I mean , the matter that you read , my lord .
By my faith , he is very swift and sententious .
Thou may 'st revenge , O slave !
Two things provided more : that for this favor He presently become a Christian ; The other , that he do record a gift Here in the court , of all he dies possessed , Unto his son Lorenzo and his daughter .
Therefore let Benedick , like covered fire , Consume away in sighs , waste inwardly .
I remember .
Sir , here's the door .
If we be not relieved within this hour , We must return to th' court of guard .
What Adam dost thou mean ?
I see a voice .
Neither my husband nor the slave returned That in such haste I sent to seek his master ?
Which I take to be either a fool or a cipher .
He hath , my lord , but be you well assured No more than he'll unswear .
Did you send to him , sir ?
Yes , marry , sir .
Seek it out .
My lord , I can not .
I said thou hadst a fine wit .
Take that , and that .
Would I had met my dearest foe in heaven Or ever I had seen that day , Horatio .
Peace there !
Besides , his cote , his flocks , and bounds of feed Are now on sale , and at our sheepcote now , By reason of his absence , there is nothing That you will feed on .
For what good turn ?
Most mighty duke , behold a man much wronged .
I have no food for thee .
First , rehearse your song by rote , To each word a warbling note .
Whoever bound him , I will loose his bonds And gain a husband by his liberty. , Speak , old Egeon , if thou be'st the man That hadst a wife once called Emilia , That bore thee at a burden two fair sons .
His grace looks cheerfully and smooth this morning .
Thou'dst thank me but a little for my counsel ; And yet I'll promise thee she shall be rich , And very rich .
Presently ?
We shall , my lord , Perform what you command us .
Is my lord well , that he doth speak so wide ?
It is a great price for a small vice .
And so I shall catch the fly , your cousin , in the latter end and she must be blind too .
I could not forget you , for I never saw you before in all my life .
Have I in conquest stretched mine arm so far To be afraid to tell graybeards the truth ?
But for which of my good parts did you first suffer love for me ?
It were too gross To rib her cerecloth in the obscure grave .
Go , coward as thou art .
Let me go , I say .
To Baptista Minola .
Hide it in smiles and affability .
What beard were I best to play it in ?
So .
It is very sultry , as 'twere , I can not tell how .
Let me embrace with old Vincentio , And wander we to see thy honest son , Who will of thy arrival be full joyous .
Friar !
Give me a calendar .
We therefore have great cause of thankfulness And shall forget the office of our hand Sooner than quittance of desert and merit According to the weight and worthiness .
Dry up in her the organs of increase , And from her derogate body never spring A babe to honor her .
O , make them joyful .
Ho , open the door .
You shall mark Many a duteous and knee-crooking knave That ( doting on his own obsequious bondage ) Wears out his time much like his master's ass For naught but provender , and when he's old , cashiered .
But I'll not chide thee .
Sir , he dined with her there , at the Porpentine .
Why art thou angry ?
Then , lest he may , prevent .
What sayest thou , Biondello ?
And look to have it yielded with all kindness .
Finish , good lady .
Heaven knows what she has known .
Dost thou mean the crown ?
I'll stay no longer question .
The wiser , the waywarder .
Sweet mistress , what your name is else I know not , Nor by what wonder you do hit of mine , ,
Norfolk , we must have knocks , ha , must we not ?
And do you now strew flowers in his way That comes in triumph over Pompey's blood ?
Prithee , say on .
Sword" is an oath , and oaths must have their course .
Fear nothing .
Thou'st spoken right .
So , This is to horse .
Speak .
Hail !
Your eldest daughters have fordone themselves , And desperately are dead .
Gallants , I am not as I have been .
Away !
Sir , grieve not you .
I was , but I do find more pain in banishment Than death can yield me here by my abode .
Judge , O you gods , how dearly Caesar loved him !
Master , I am here entered in bond for you .
Marry , do I , sir , and I came to acquaint you with a matter .
Oh , devil , devil !
Good friends , go in and taste some wine with me .
But tell me , is young George Stanley living ?
Away !
Speak'st thou in sober meanings ?
It weeps , it bleeds , and each new day a gash Is added to her wounds .
Moreover that we much did long to see you , The need we have to use you did provoke Our hasty sending .
No , I will not cast away my physic but on those that are sick .
It is now high suppertime , and the night grows to waste .
Beloved Regan , Thy sister's naught .
This is no answer , thou unfeeling man , To excuse the current of thy cruelty .
I have known when there was no music with him but the drum and the fife , and now had he rather hear the tabor and the pipe .
Caesar , 'tis strucken eight .
Then bring me to their sights .
Ay , better than him I am before knows me .
What say you then to Falconbridge , the young baron of England ?
Up to some scaffold , there to lose their heads .
That he was never trained up in arms .
My husband say that she was false !
What an eye she has !
Or does he walk ?
You must call forth the watch that are their accusers .
I have been to seek you .
Heaven rest them now .
I know by that same eye there's some good news .
How many goodly creatures are there here !
He has my dying voice .
Ay , mother , but I would not have it so .
What , ho !
I do love it better than laughing .
I can not find it .
Hast thou slain him then ?
What , will our mother come ?
I will have it all mine .
Am I in France ?
As proper men as ever trod upon neat's leather have gone upon my handiwork .
What's the noise ?
I will leave you now to your gossip-like humor .
O Sisters three , Come , come to me With hands as pale as milk .
Tonight in Harfleur will we be your guest ; Tomorrow for the march are we addressed .
It is a theme as fluent as the sea .
The sum of all I can , I have disclosed .
Do you mark that , my lord ?
If that her breath will mist or stain the stone , Why then , she lives .
I know that virtue to be in you , Brutus , As well as I do know your outward favor .
We have here recovered the most dangerous piece of lechery that ever was known in the commonwealth .
Whither are you going ?
This , and Saint George to boot , What think'st thou , Norfolk ?
Well , I can not tell .
If thou canst love me for this , take me .
Why , Antony .
A friend .
Work , work your thoughts , and therein see a siege .
And so it is , truly , and very notably discharged .
Gentlemen both , you will mistake each other .
You have it full , Benedick .
Thou , it seems , that calls for company to countenance her .
Follow me not .
Bring forth men-children only , For thy undaunted mettle should compose Nothing but males .
Wrong hath but wrong , and blame the due of blame .
Give me some help .
County Claudio , when mean you to go to church ?
Thomas the earl of Surrey and himself , Much about cockshut time , from troop to troop Went through the army cheering up the soldiers .
It is a wise father that knows his own child .
Charles , I thank thee for thy love to me , which thou shalt find I will most kindly requite .
Where should I lose that handkerchief , Emilia ?
To feed were best at home ; From thence , the sauce to meat is ceremony ; Meeting were bare without it .
Ay .
Bid every noise be still .
And hath challenged thee ?
You have simply misused our sex in your love-prate .
Oh , farewell !
Well , gentlemen , I am thus resolved : On Sunday next , you know My daughter Katherina is to be married .
We'll not run , Monsieur Monster .
Name him .
Unkindness may do much , And his unkindness may defeat my life , But never taint my love .
So fare you well till we shall meet again .
The players can not keep counsel .
Two deep enemies , Foes to my rest , and my sweet sleep's disturbers , Are they that I would have thee deal upon .
Arise , arise , Awake the snorting citizens with the bell Or else the devil will make a grandsire of you .
Whither away ?
As from your graves rise up , and walk like sprites , To countenance this horror !
We must not .
Not so happy , yet much happier .
He faints ! , My lord , my lord !
Go to , say you nothing .
Gone , sir .
I saw the Duchess of Milan's gown that they praise so .
Doth his Majesty Incline to it or no ?
No , Caesar shall not .
I Richard's body have interred anew , And on it have bestowed more contrite tears Than from it issued forced drops of blood .
Call the messenger .
Go you and prepare Aliena , for look you , here comes my Rosalind .
Now by my George , my Garter , and my crown , Profaned , dishonored , and the third usurped .
Oh , is 't come to this ?
They are louder than the weather or our office .
The king would speak with Cornwall .
Pray you Be ever known to patience .
Farewell .
It is indifferent cold , my lord , indeed .
No masque tonight .
I should know that voice .
I am sure you are not Launcelot , my boy .
You have lost no reputation at all unless you repute yourself such a loser .
Look , they weep , And I , an ass , am onion-eyed .
But one word more , He will not be commanded .
There's part of a power already footed .
Wilt thou make a trust a transgression ?
I prithee , pretty York , who told thee this ?
Report is changeable .
Your wrongs do set a scandal on my sex .
What , man , 'tis a night of revels !
But adieu .
Then forth , dear countrymen .
Let us hear what Antony can say .
This lanthorn doth the horned moon present .
Tis a point of wisdom .
The images of revolt and flying off .
Why ?
Now follow , if thou darest , to try whose right , Of thine or mine , is most in Helena .
Nay , pray you throw none away .
Let her not say 'tis I that keep you here .
I'll tell my husband , Launcelot , what you say .
It doth appear you are a worthy judge .
No , my good knight .
You , you , sirrah , where's my daughter ?
I chose her when I could not ask my father For his advice , nor thought I had one .
I'll leave you , lady .
Why , right , you are in the right .
Go fetch My best attires .
O my brave Emperor , this is fought indeed !
Have you heard of no likely wars toward 'twixt the two Dukes of Cornwall and Albany ?
Security gives way to conspiracy .
The murmuring surge That on th ' unnumbered idle pebbles chafes Can not be heard so high .
How shall I answer you ?
Tush , I may as well say the fool's the fool .
Has he , masters ?
No .
To cut the forfeiture from that bankrupt there .
Domestic fury and fierce civil strife Shall cumber all the parts of Italy .
Marry , heaven forbid !
See better , Lear , and let me still remain The true blank of thine eye .
And then , as we have ta'en the sacrament , We will unite the white rose and the red .
A fair name .
My dear lord , You know the fiery quality of the duke , How unremoveable and fixed he is In his own course .
Come , my fair Cordelia .
But life , being weary of these worldly bars , Never lacks power to dismiss itself .
Feed and sleep .
There is a cliff , whose high and bending head Looks fearfully in the confined deep .
Strike !
Then the liars and swearers are fools , for there are liars and swearers enough to beat the honest men and hang up them .
Be not too tame neither , but let your own discretion be your tutor .
Some light-foot friend post to the duke of Norfolk , Ratcliffe , thyself , or Catesby .
Sir , he's rash and very sudden in choler , and haply may strike at you .
His forward voice now is to speak well of his friend .
Let us be sacrificers but not butchers , Caius .
Both , both , my girl .
I commanded the sleeves should be cut out and sewed up again , and that I'll prove upon thee , though thy little finger be armed in a thimble .
It is with a good will .
I should have been a sore one then .
Casca , by your voice .
I fear thee not .
It is Brabantio .
Methinks they are such a gentle nation that , but for the mountain of mad flesh
Laugh to scorn The power of man , for none of woman born Shall harm Macbeth .
His knights grow riotous , and himself upbraids us On every trifle .
We thank your Honor .
Where , where , Messala , doth his body lie ?
Oh , well-a-day , Lady !
What , think you we are Turks or infidels ?
None good , my liege , to please you with the hearing , Nor none so bad but well may be reported .
He will not know what all but he do know .
It shall advantage more than do us wrong .
Oh , then belike you fancy riches more .
I did .
Never believe it .
Thou seest that all the grace that she hath left Is that she will not add to her damnation A sin of perjury .
But ere we could arrive the point proposed , Caesar cried , "Help me , Cassius , or I sink ! " I , as Aeneas , our great ancestor , Did from the flames of Troy upon his shoulder The old Anchises bear , so from the waves of Tiber Did I the tired Caesar .
This is more strange Than such a murder is .
Hope I may choose , sir .
She is never sad but when she sleeps , and not ever sad then , for I have heard my daughter say she hath often dreamed of unhappiness and waked herself with laughing .
Censure me in your wisdom , and awake your senses that you may the better judge .
I am their father's mother .
Look what is done can not be now amended .
Fetch thy master home .
May we do so ?
Do you find Your patience so predominant in your nature That you can let this go ?
At sea , I think .
Two hundred ducats .
Why should he stay , whom love doth press to go ?
Do , with like timorous accent and dire yell As when , by night and negligence , the fire Is spied in populous cities .
And leave out thee ?
Take to you no hard thoughts .
Drunk ?
Sweet saint , for charity , be not so curst .
I am a Jew .
But heavenly Rosalind !
As freely , son , as God did give her me .
Very well .
The tyrannous and bloody act is done , The most arch deed of piteous massacre That ever yet this land was guilty of .
How now , fellow ?
Hers you are .
I speak but brotherly of him , but should I anatomize him to thee as he is , I must blush and weep , and thou must look pale and wonder .
I pray you all , If you have hitherto concealed this sight , Let it be tenable in your silence still .
Sirrah young gamester , your father were a fool To give thee all and in his waning age Set foot under thy table .
I am ashamed that women are so simple To offer war where they should kneel for peace ; Or seek for rule , supremacy and sway When they are bound to serve , love , and obey .
If that be all , masters , I hear no harm .
And I for no woman .
Peace , sirrah !
He was a goodly king .
Better cheer may you have , but not with better heart .
We have beat him to his camp .
I can tell you it will serve you to mend your shoes .
Why , after I have cut the egg i ' th ' middle and eat up the meat , the two crowns of the egg .
The king shall drink to Hamlet's better breath , And in the cup an union shall he throw Richer than that which four successive kings In Denmark's crown have worn .
We are arrant knaves , all .
Nay , we will all of us be there to fetch him .
None but a holy hermit and her maid .
Fierce fiery warriors fought upon the clouds In ranks and squadrons and right form of war , Which drizzled blood upon the Capitol .
Well , then , that's the humor of 't .
Come , march to wakes and fairs and market towns .
By heaven , you do me wrong !
Ay , my commander .
Dispatch. , O love , That thou couldst see my wars today , and knew'st The royal occupation !
Have you not read , Roderigo , Of some such thing ?
He'll be hanged yet , though every drop of water swear against it and gape at widest to glut him .
You have astonished him .
Pray you , be careful .
What fool is this ?
Did you confer with him ?
Know him I shall , I am well sure of it .
Father , 'tis thus : yourself and all the world That talked of her have talked amiss of her .
Thou told'st me Thou didst hold him in thy hate .
Let it work , For 'tis the sport to have the engineer Hoist with his own petard .
So she may live unscarred of bleeding slaughter , I will confess she was not Edward's daughter .
Why is my lord enraged against his love ?
My good friends , hark !
So please you , for I never heard it yet , Yet heard too much of Phoebe's cruelty .
It was some fiend .
It is a kind of history .
Where is gentle Rivers , Vaughan , Grey ?
The enemy comes on in gallant show .
I found you as a morsel cold upon Dead Caesar's trencher .
O , I die , Horatio .
Crowns in my purse I have and goods at home , And so am come abroad to see the world .
Prithee , be cheerful .
Signor Bassanio !
Whither will you that I go To answer this your charge ?
They all do hate him As rootedly as I .
I do serve you in this business .
Fare you well .
I'll make her come , I warrant you , presently .
Thou call'st on him that hates thee .
Do you withdraw yourself a little while ,
What !
Therefore bear up and board 'em. , Servant- monster , drink to me .
O , thou well-skilled in curses , stay awhile , And teach me how to curse mine enemies .
Tis now struck twelve .
To the death , my lord .
Had all his hairs been lives My great revenge had stomach for them all .
What would she have ?
What will you do with 't , that you have been so earnest To have me filch it ?
I never saw her till this time .
Not shine today ?
We talk with goblins , owls , and sprites : If we obey them not , this will ensue : They'll suck our breath , or pinch us black and blue .
Now go we in content To liberty , and not to banishment .
I humbly beseech you , proceed to th ' affairs of state .
Whither ?
Well , good night .
He is my prisoner .
Hush !
Now , Ursula , when Beatrice doth come , As we do trace this alley up and down , Our talk must only be of Benedick .
You are a fool .
Was the crown offered him thrice ?
I take my leave at once .
Great God of heaven , say amen to all !
What would you say to me now , an I were your very , very Rosalind ?
What black magician conjures up this fiend To stop devoted charitable deeds ?
If you prove a mutineer , the next tree .
A deed without a name .
Who talks within there ?
This is a man's invention , and his hand .
It was , as I have seen it in his life , A sable silvered .
Tis a brave army , and full of purpose .
God make incision in thee ; thou art raw .
He says so .
Have done thy charm , thou hateful , withered hag .
Your Majesty says very true .
Sovereign of Egypt , hail !
My tongue and soul in this be hypocrites .
I will indeed no longer endure it , nor am I yet persuaded to put up in peace what already I have foolishly suffered .
Away !
And hath given countenance to his speech , my lord , With almost all the holy vows of heaven .
Up with my tent ! , Here will I lie tonight .
For he partly begs To be desired to give .
But , as they say , to hear music the general does not greatly care .
See , Caesar !
Is he not honest ?
Their lips were four red roses on a stalk , And in their summer beauty kissed each other .
Hark !
Dolabella , I shall remain your debtor .
O me !
But this it is : our foot Upon the hills adjoining to the city Shall stay with us .
In thunder , lightning , or in rain ?
Oh , bloody period !
Sir , I must have that diamond from you .
Ay , and this .
A plague upon you , murderers , traitors all !
Now , if thou wert a poet , I might have some hope thou didst feign .
A contract of true love to celebrate , And some donation freely to estate On the blessed lovers .
Nay , blush not , Cleopatra .
I was killed i ' th ' Capitol .
Who's there ?
Go , rascals , go , and fetch my supper in .
What are thy comings in ?
That skull had a tongue in it and could sing once .
Be brief , lest that the process of thy kindness Last longer telling than thy kindness ' date .
How answer you that ?
A lord to a lord , a man to a man , stuffed with all honorable virtues .
Machinations , hollowness , treachery , and all ruinous disorders follow us disquietly to our graves .
If you'll come to supper tonight , you may .
Prithee bear some charity to my wit .
I never did her any , to my knowledge .
Dost thou believe , Orlando , that the boy Can do all this that he hath promised ?
Tis the last service that I shall command you .
It is too true an evil .
I will this night , In several hands , in at his windows throw , As if they came from several citizens , Writings all tending to the great opinion That Rome holds of his name , wherein obscurely Caesar's ambition shall be glanced at .
I will bestow a breakfast to make you friends ; and we'll be all three sworn brothers to France .
Trinculo , keep a good tongue in your head .
I fear he will prove the weeping philosopher when he grows old , being so full of unmannerly sadness in his youth .
Nay , by 'r Lady , I am not such a fool to think what I list , nor I list not to think what I can , nor indeed I can not think , if I would think my heart out of thinking , that you are in love or that you will be in love or that you can be in love .
The king and prince at prayers .
You would seem to know my stops .
Ay , in the temple , in the town , the field You do me mischief .
Not I but my affairs have made you wait .
Go with me to it , and I'll show it you ; and by the way you shall tell me where in the forest you live .
Ay , marry , is 't .
Are you good men and true ?
He doth nothing but frown , as who should say , "An you will not have me , choose." He hears merry tales and smiles not .
We must not now displease him .
Thou liest , thou thread , thou thimble , Thou yard , three-quarters , half-yard , quarter , nail !
No beast so fierce but knows some touch of pity .
Merciful powers , Restrain in me the cursed thoughts that nature Gives way to in repose .
No epilogue , I pray you , for your play needs no excuse .
Come .
A friend should bear his friend's infirmities , But Brutus makes mine greater than they are .
I have not dined today .
It eats and sleeps and hath such senses As we have , such .
I am feared in field and town .
Say , Voltemand , what from our brother Norway ?
Think you not that the powers we bear with us Will cut their passage through the force of France , Doing the execution and the act For which we have in head assembled them ?
It is a business of some heat .
Was 't you he rescued ?
It seems not meet , nor wholesome to my place , To be producted ( as , if I stay , I shall ) Against the Moor .
Tell us the manner of it , gentle Casca .
Let me speak like yourself and lay a sentence Which , as a grise or step , may help these lovers .
Why , art thou mad , old fellow ?
This servitude makes you to keep unwed .
Come , talk not of her .
I will incontinently drown myself .
Is Cassius near ?
I do know him by his gait .
Silence that dreadful bell , it frights the isle From her propriety .
This weaves itself perforce into my business .
Nature in you stands on the very verge Of his confine .
Cambio is changed into Lucentio .
What is his name ?
Then let them use us well , else let them know , The ills we do , their ills instruct us so .
For aught that I could ever read , Could ever hear by tale or history , The course of true love never did run smooth .
O ye gods , Render me worthy of this noble wife !
A wretched soul , bruised with adversity We bid be quiet when we hear it cry , But were we burdened with like weight of pain , As much or more we should ourselves complain .
In weightier things you'll say a beggar nay .
Take him on the costard with the hilts of thy sword , and then throw him into the malmsey butt in the next room .
No , madam .
They would else have been troubled with a pernicious suitor .
Trust me , I take him for the better dog .
If you choose that wherein I am contained , Straight shall our nuptial rites be solemnized .
Farewell , my Desdemona .
Welcome to Rome .
Ah , Rosencrantz !
There sleeps Titania sometime of the night , Lulled in these flowers with dances and delight .
Yes , in truth it is , sir .
So the gods preserve thee !
For you know , nuncle , The hedge-sparrow fed the cuckoo so long , That it's had it head bit off by it young .
But if all aim but this be leveled false , The supposition of the lady's death Will quench the wonder of her infamy .
You praise yourself By laying defects of judgment to me , but You patched up your excuses .
O , but one word .
Nod to him , elves , and do him courtesies .
Your name , sir , truly .
A likely piece of work , that you should find it in your chamber , and not know who left it there !
And neither man nor master would take aught But the two rings .
He is composed and framed of treachery , And fled he is upon this villainy .
I thank you , madam .
I warrant you , my lord .
Caesar , my lord .
Yea , very force entangles Itself with strength .
If thou wilt weep my fortunes , take my eyes .
Let me see .
What's the matter ?
Most monsterlike be shown For poor'st diminutives , for dolts , and let Patient Octavia plow thy visage up With her prepared nails !
Oh , me , lieutenant !
Here , sir !
My lord , I will use them according to their desert .
If he be perjured , see you now , his reputation is as arrant a villain and a Jack Sauce as ever his black shoe trod upon God's ground and His earth , in my conscience , la .
With good acceptance of his Majesty , Save that there was not time enough to hear , As I perceived his Grace would fain have done , The severals and unhidden passages Of his true titles to some certain dukedoms , And generally to the crown and seat of France , Derived from Edward , his great-grandfather .
How goes it now ?
A bitter fool .
Yet thou liest in the bleak air .
There was , for a while , no money bid for argument unless the poet and the player went to cuffs in the question .
Nor will not .
Observe her , stand close .
Of this my letters Before did satisfy you .
And seemed I ever otherwise to you ?
Noble Antony , not sickness should detain me .
Follow that lord , and look you mock him not .
But the great one that goes up the hill , let him draw thee after .
That must we also .
Say , what ?
You can not revel into dukedoms there .
And are not you my husband ?
There's my cap .
There's a time for all things .
When I do name him , let it be thy part To praise him more than ever man did merit .
Therefore take heed how you impawn our person , How you awake our sleeping sword of war .
I stumbled when I saw .
I deny it not .
O earth !
I like the new tire within excellently , if the hair were a thought browner ; and your gown's a most rare fashion , i ' faith .
I think the policy of that purpose made more in the marriage than the love of the parties .
Twas I , but 'tis not I. I do not shame To tell you what I was , since my conversion So sweetly tastes , being the thing I am .
Good morrow , neighbor Baptista .
Please it your Grace lead on ?
In Kent , my liege , the Guilfords are in arms , And every hour more competitors Flock to the rebels , and their power grows strong .
My cake is dough , but I'll in among the rest , Out of hope of all but my share of the feast .
And when I have my meed , I will away , For this will out , and then I must not stay .
When I am known aright you shall not grieve Lending me this acquaintance .
Ne'er may I look on day , nor sleep on night But she tells to your Highness simple truth .
Keep promise , love .
He would be crowned .
Your hand , Leonato .
Fare you well .
Now , the next day Was our sea fight , and what to this was sequent Thou know'st already .
And I do think , or else this brain of mine Hunts not the trail of policy so sure As it hath used to do , that I have found The very cause of Hamlet's lunacy .
And as with age his body uglier grows , So his mind cankers .
Upon his royal face there is no note How dread an army hath enrounded him , Nor doth he dedicate one jot of color Unto the weary and all-watched night , But freshly looks and overbears attaint With cheerful semblance and sweet majesty , That every wretch , pining and pale before , Beholding him , plucks comfort from his looks .
Oh , my soul's joy !
Kind gentlemen , your pains Are registered where every day I turn The leaf to read them .
Excellent well !
Tell her I am arrested in the street , And that shall bail me .
From seventeen years till now almost fourscore Here lived I , but now live here no more .
I am not mad .
Let us our lives , our souls , our debts , our careful wives , our children , and our sins lay on the king !
A foe to tyrants , and my country's friend .
Because their business still lies out o ' door .
You should hear reason .
Never .
A plague upon you all !
What beast was 't , then , That made you break this enterprise to me ?
This , this All Souls ' Day to my fearful soul Is the determined respite of my wrongs .
Followed the old man forth .
Do so .
Maintain a mourning ostentation , And on your family's old monument Hang mournful epitaphs and do all rites That appertain unto a burial .
E'en as the o'erflowing Nilus presageth famine .
Troth , I think your other rebato were better .
Ingrateful fox , 'tis he .
Put your torches out .
Go release them , Ariel .
They met so near with their lips that their breaths embraced together .
Well , I have done .
If not , 'tis true this parting was well made .
I muse why she's at liberty .
Give you good night .
That is hot ice and wondrous strange snow .
I warrant it will .
Give me up the truth .
Be not lost So poorly in your thoughts .
I'll apprehend him .
Thus far with rough and all-unable pen Our bending author hath pursued the story , In little room confining mighty men , Mangling by starts the full course of their glory .
The wager thou hast won , and I will add Unto their losses twenty thousand crowns , Another dowry to another daughter , For she is changed as she had never been .
What needs more words ?
Let him kill one first .
A horned man's a monster and a beast .
A soothsayer bids you beware the ides of March .
What have you , my good friends , deserved at the hands of fortune that she sends you to prison hither ?
That she is worthy , I know .
Labio and Flavio , set our battles on .
I have full cause of weeping , but this heart Shall break into a hundred thousand flaws , Or ere I'll weep. , O Fool , I shall go mad !
The gods forbid !
Ho , now you strike like the blind man .
O , good sir , I do .
It is the cry of women , my good lord .
Peace !
So 'tis to thee .
Silence !
What , will you murder me ? , Thou jailer , thou , I am thy prisoner .
How long hath she been thus ?
Next month with us .
This is above all strangeness .
A match !
Fret till your proud heart break .
So may you lose your arms .
Our size of sorrow , Proportioned to our cause , must be as great As that which makes it .
It would seem strange unto him when he waked .
Caesar did write for him to come to Rome .
All's well , sweeting , Come away to bed. , Myself will be your surgeon .
But this reasoning is not in the fashion to choose me a husband .
Yes indeed .
Know , sir , that I Will not wait pinioned at your master's court , Nor once be chastised with the sober eye Of dull Octavia .
Pray you now , forget and forgive .
For when rich villains have need of poor ones , poor ones may make what price they will .
O heavy deed !
I can be patient .
What love could press Lysander from my side ?
You have a daughter called Elizabeth , Virtuous and fair , royal and gracious .
So farewell to you both .
There is no fear in him .
It ish give over .
How comes this trick upon him ?
The jewels you have had from me to deliver Desdemona would half have corrupted a votaress .
But will my Rosalind do so ?
One dead , or drunk ?
Tarry , Petruchio , I must go with thee , For in Baptista's keep my treasure is .
Tremblingly she stood And on the sudden dropped .
Not know my voice !
Speak , I'll go no further .
How oddly he is suited !
I urged you further , then you scratched your head And too impatiently stamped with your foot .
Searching the window for a flint , I found This paper , thus sealed up , and I am sure It did not lie there when I went to bed .
Are they returned ?
For I am almost ready to dissolve , Hearing of this .
Wherefore this ghastly looking ?
Iago ?
That ever I should call thee castaway !
I can not make you what amends I would ; Therefore accept such kindness as I can .
Thou 'rt kind .
No , no , I am as ugly as a bear , For beasts that meet me run away for fear .
But we both obey And here give up ourselves , in the full bent , To lay our service freely at your feet To be commanded .
God be with my old master .
O sir , I do , and will repute you ever The patron of my life and liberty .
And after that he came thus sad away ?
Part them !
Longer , longer .
At Pembroke , or at Ha'rfordwest in Wales .
Abominable villain !
Where's Monsieur Mustardseed ?
If he come tomorrow , I'll give him his payment .
I prithee , who doth he trot withal ?
What think'st thou ?
For if the sun breed maggots in a dead dog , being a good kissing carrion , Have you a daughter ?
How long have you been a sectary astronomical ?
Do I look like a cudgel or a hovel-post , a staff or a prop ?
If you choose that , then I am yours withal .
The time 'twixt six and now Must by us both be spent most preciously .
Gentle cousin , Let us go thank him and encourage him .
Good friend , go to him .
Out of these convertites There is much matter to be heard and learned .
I hope my noble lord esteems me honest .
Not I .
I , sir , am Dromio .
What , no more ceremony ?
Oh , who hath done this deed ?
O time's extremity , Hast thou so crack'd and splitted my poor tongue In seven short years that here my only son Knows not my feeble key of untuned cares ?
Sayest thou so ?
It gives me wonder great as my content To see you here before me .
And thus thy fall hath left a kind of blot To mark the full-fraught man and best endued With some suspicion .
Did he not rather Discredit my authority with yours , And make the wars alike against my stomach , Having alike your cause ?
I never felt it till now , Two thousand ducats in that , and other precious , precious jewels .
I and my bosom must debate awhile , And then I would no other company .
Ay , 'twas he that told me on her first .
Give me the letter , sir .
What , with worms and flies ?
Keep close , I thee command .
Tis wonderful .
To this chair bind him. , Villain , thou shalt find , By the kind gods , 'tis most ignobly done To pluck me by the beard .
We have , sir .
Therefore play , music. , Prince , thou art sad .
Sweet remembrancer !
Against my soul's pure truth why labour you To make it wander in an unknown field ?
Which of you two did dine with me today ?
And so will I .
Sir , Octavius is already come to Rome .
Oh , that the slave had forty thousand lives !
Though Birnam Wood be come to Dunsinane , And thou opposed , being of no woman born , Yet I will try the last .
Had you such leisure in the time of death To gaze upon the secrets of the deep ?
Whether he was combined With those of Norway , or did line the rebel With hidden help and vantage , or that with both He labored in his country's wrack , I know not ; But treasons capital , confessed and proved , Have overthrown him .
Bad news , my lord .
Do you intend to stay with me tonight ?
I am famished in his service .
No medicine in the world can do thee good .
Who can blot that name With any just reproach ?
You have said now .
Here comes Antony .
Was ever woman in this humor won ?

My lord , I have news to tell you .
Behold the threaden sails , Borne with th ' invisible and creeping wind , Draw the huge bottoms through the furrowed sea , Breasting the lofty surge .
Meseemeth good that with some little train Forthwith from Ludlow the young prince be fet Hither to London , to be crowned our king .
Burn !
If she and I be pleased , what's that to you ?
What villains have done this ?
If thou follow him , thou must needs wear my coxcomb. , How now , nuncle ?
Now , princely Buckingham , seal thou this league With thy embracements to my wife's allies And make me happy in your unity .
What a sigh is there !
Tis almost fairy time .
For , as it is a heartbreaking to see a handsome man loose-wived , so it is a deadly sorrow to behold a foul knave uncuckolded .
Nay , stay .
All disconsolate , With Pindarus his bondman on this hill .
No , it is Casca , one incorporate To our attempts .
Do you smell a fault ?
So take her to thee , shepherd .
You know I gave it you half an hour since .
Sir , most heedfully .
She can not be so much without true judgment , Having so swift and excellent a wit As she is prized to have , as to refuse So rare a gentleman as Signior Benedick .
To the health of our general !
Prithee , how many boys and wenches must I have ?
Why , what you will .
So , I am satisfied .
Oh , make an end Of what I have begun !
But 'tis gone .
Till thou canst rail the seal from off my bond , Thou but offend'st thy lungs to speak so loud .
So says the Prince and my new-trothed lord .
It can not be but thou hast murdered him .
Revenge .
From top to toe ?
No , my noble lord .
Companion , hence !
Shall I lay perjury upon my soul ?
Who knows he is ?
If he do bleed , I'll gild the faces of the grooms withal , For it must seem their guilt .
Let our reciprocal vows be remembered .
These be the Christian husbands .
And what say'st thou then to my love ?
What have you done ?
Caesar , I will .
I am pale , Charmian .
I thank thee , good Tubal .
Thank you .
I learned it in England where indeed they are most potent in potting .
Hastings and Edward's children , Grey and Rivers , Holy King Henry and thy fair son Edward , Vaughan , and all that have miscarried By underhand , corrupted , foul injustice , If that your moody , discontented souls Do through the clouds behold this present hour , Even for revenge mock my destruction. , This is All Souls ' Day , fellow , is it not ?
Is this a dagger which I see before me , The handle toward my hand ?
Then leave her , sir , for by the power that made me , I tell you all her wealth .
Yet but three ?
Didst thou dream , Lucius , that thou so criedst out ?
Urge me no more , I shall forget myself .
He hath disgraced me and hindered me half a million , laughed at my losses , mocked at my gains , scorned my nation , thwarted my bargains , cooled my friends , heated mine enemies , and what's his reason ?
Here will we sit and let the sounds of music Creep in our ears .
Look to the queen there , ho !
Faith , once or twice she heaved the name of "father" Pantingly forth as if it pressed her heart , Cried , "Sisters , sisters !
I do wander everywhere Swifter than the moon's sphere .
I humbly thank your ladyship .
I have but with a cursitory eye O'erglanced the articles .
Since this fortune falls to you , Be content and seek no new .
Thrice the brinded cat hath mewed .
Grace grow where those drops fall !
Of all the wonders that I yet have heard , It seems to me most strange that men should fear , Seeing that death , a necessary end , Will come when it will come .
But yet thou art my flesh , my blood , my daughter , Or rather a disease that's in my flesh , Which I must needs call mine .
Oh , I could weep My spirit from mine eyes .
Ah , that good Kent , He said it would be thus , poor banished man .
My house was at the Phoenix ?
Thou dost not wish more help from England , coz ?
He hath confessed .
So please your Lordship to accept our duty .
I'll plague him .
Here comes Thisbe .
What wouldst thou with us ?
And till she come , as truly as to heaven I do confess the vices of my blood So justly to your grave ears I'll present How I did thrive in this fair lady's love And she in mine .
A marvelous witty fellow , I assure you , but I will go about with him. , Come you hither , sirrah , a word in your ear .
But if you do refuse to marry me , You'll give yourself to this most faithful shepherd ?
Let them come in .
Ay , or any show that you will show him .
Let that be left Which leaves itself .
Detain no jot , I charge thee .
Live a little , comfort a little , cheer thyself a little .

For certainly thou art so near the gulf Thou needs must be englutted .
Eyes , do you see ?
My dagger , little cousin ?
O ceremony , show me but thy worth !
Women are made to bear , and so are you .
This is the penthouse under which Lorenzo Desired us to make stand .
We'll feast each other ere we part , and let's Draw lots who shall begin .
Well , well , put up your sword .
O noble fool !
Am not I your Rosalind ?
I hope thou art not mad .
Pluck up thy spirits .
Here's to thee , Menas !

No more but so ?

Sister , you know he promised me a chain .

Let our officers Have notice what we purpose .
Give first admittance to th ' ambassadors .

Not till you have slept .
O Hamlet , what a falling off was there !
Out o ' th ' moon , I do assure thee .
Well , stand aside. , 'Fore God , they are both in a ale .
I frown upon him , yet he loves me still .
That is enough to satisfy the senate .
But not , as I am , royal .
Ha , ha , ha !
I will not .
Now , were not I a little pot and soon hot , my very lips might freeze to my teeth , my tongue to the roof of my mouth , my heart in my belly , ere I should come by a fire to thaw me .
Are you sure of that ?
We will yet do well .
All springs reduce their currents to mine eyes , That I , being governed by the watery moon , May send forth plenteous tears to drown the world .
For in all the play There is not one word apt , one player fitted .

The next Caesarion smite , Till by degrees the memory of my womb , Together with my brave Egyptians all , By the discandying of this pelleted storm Lie graveless till the flies and gnats of Nile Have buried them for prey !
Good my lord , You have been a boggler ever .
He bounds from the earth , as if his entrails were hairs , le cheval volant , the Pegasus , qui a les narines de feu .
But beshrew my jealousy !
Within these three days let me hear thee say That Cassio's not alive .
Into a thousand that I have forgotten .
Come .

What means this jest ?
What is your pleasure ?
How say you now ?
Wherefore throng you hither ?
Murder !
Returned so soon ?
O Setebos , these be brave spirits indeed !
Give thy thoughts no tongue , Nor any unproportioned thought his act .
Moreover , he hath left you all his walks , His private arbors and new-planted orchards , On this side Tiber .
All's cheerless , dark , and deadly .
Never fear that .
Fie upon 't , foh !
Bruised pieces , go .
My grandam told me he was murdered there .
You have not called me so , nor have you cause .
Their villainy goes against my weak stomach , and therefore I must cast it up .
Well , let it strike .
We Have used to conquer standing on the earth And fighting foot to foot .
Wisdom and goodness to the vile seem vile .
Who doth he gallop withal ?
Here is the money .
The thoughts of people .
The king my father ? !
Therefore is it most expedient for the wise , if Don Worm , his conscience , find no impediment to the contrary , to be the trumpet of his own virtues , as I am to myself .
Truly , a peck of provender .
I make all use of it , for I use it only .
What serious contemplation are you in ?
Tender yourself more dearly , Or , not to crack the wind of the poor phrase , Running it thus , you'll tender me a fool .
Tranio , you jest .
I have no power upon you .
Sirs , let 't alone .
I would I were as sure of a good dinner .
My husband !
A truant disposition , good my lord .
Be better at thy leisure .
Young fry of treachery !
But though they jump not on a just account , As in these cases , where the aim reports 'T is oft with difference , yet do they all confirm A Turkish fleet , and bearing up to Cyprus .
Do you confess the bond ?
Therefore be deaf to my unpitied folly , And all the gods go with you !
That courtesy would be uncleanly if courtiers were shepherds .
Am I the motive of these tears , my lord ?
I am heartily glad I came hither to you .
O eastern star !
Where wilt thou lead me ?
When it appears to you where this begins , Turn your displeasure that way , for our faults Can never be so equal that your love Can equally move with them .
O thou bloody prison , Fatal and ominous to noble peers !
Therefore prepare to die .
I call thee not .
I pray thee , do not mock me , fellow student .
Things growing are not ripe until their season .
Alas the day !
Didst thou not kill this king ?
I shall fall .
What did you enact ?
No more .
Murder !
Barnardo ?
Pray you , keep seat .
Come , father , I'll bestow you with a friend .
Pray heavens he be , For I have served him , and the man commands Like a full soldier .
Never come such division 'tween our souls .
But , brother , I can tell you strange news that you yet dreamt not of .
Madam , you must come to your uncle .
I'll have some proof .
I think there's never a man in Christendom Can lesser hide his love or hate than he , For by his face straight shall you know his heart .
First , I must tell thee this : Desdemona is directly in love with him .
What , have you lost your wits ?
You know sometimes he walks four hours together Here in the lobby .
Ay , sir , they be ready .
If there be truth in sight , you are my Rosalind .
Pardon me , I pray you .
Even those you were wont to take delight in , the tragedians of the city .
I pray thee , if it stand with honesty , Buy thou the cottage , pasture , and the flock , And thou shalt have to pay for it of us .
But who comes here ?
Know me for Brutus !
Good your highness , patience .
Prithee , nuncle , be contented .
I thank you , sir .
Come , my lord , and in our flight Tell me how it came this night That I sleeping here was found With these mortals on the ground .
What , may it please you , shall I do at Salisbury ?
Tomorrow or next day they will be here .
They are afoot .
Come thee on .
Why then , my cousin , Margaret , and Ursula Are much deceived , for they did swear you did .
Six or seven thousand is their utmost power .
But stop my house's ears , I mean my casements , Let not the sound of shallow foppery enter My sober house .
Brutus speaks .
What's your highness' pleasure ?
Oh !
Hark , they roar .
Yet , coming from him , that great med'cine hath With his tinct gilded thee .
Do not think , gentlemen , I am drunk .
I take 't 'tis later , sir .
Signor Antonio ?
I am not sorry neither .
I do not like thy look , I promise thee .
O Stephano , hast any more of this ?
Oh , fie upon thee , slanderer !
First , know my horse is tired , my master and mistress fallen out .
We have sworn , my lord , already .
Welcome to Cyprus .
Ay , every man away .
An the duke had not given him sixpence a day for playing Pyramus , I'll be hanged .
My will , not all the world .
Do not you meddle .
Bid Gloucester think of this , and he will weep .
Three or four wenches where I stood cried , "Alas , good soul ! " and forgave him with all their hearts .
I'll fish for thee and get thee wood enough .
I can not drink too much of Brutus ' love .
It does , my lord .
Or I have no observance .
Statilius showed the torchlight but , my lord , He came not back .
Or rather , do I not in plainest truth Tell you I do not , nor I can not , love you ?
Lucius , awake .
There comes an old man and his three sons , I could match this beginning with an old tale .
Look , Don Pedro is returned to seek you .
Thou art the thing itself .
My villainy ?
What mean you , Caesar ?
This is the day wherein I wished to fall By the false faith of him who most I trusted .
Sister , content you in my discontent. , Sir , to your pleasure humbly I subscribe .
Bellario greets your grace .
I would your duty were as foolish too .
What is 't thou say'st ?
His present and your pains we thank you for .
Oh , I have suffered With those that I saw suffer .
See how yon justice rails upon yon simple thief .
Yet leave our cousin Katherine here with us .
Therefore You will not pay for the glasses you have burst ?
I'll pluck thee berries .
I'll help you to a horse .
Proculeius , What thou hast done thy master Caesar knows , And he hath sent for thee .
Yet Brutus says he was ambitious , And Brutus is an honorable man .
She , dying , as it must so be maintained , Upon the instant that she was accused , Shall be lamented , pitied and excused Of every hearer .
Perdition catch my soul But I do love thee !
The weight of this sad time we must obey .
Dead , I think. , Help , uncle ! , Hero , why , Hero !
Brutus , a word with you .
And I am witness with her that she did .
Say that she frown ; I'll say she looks as clear As morning roses newly washed with dew .
I hear my father coming .
Alack , why thus ?
But this is most falliable , the worm's an odd worm .
Bear'st thou her face in mind ?
What was he , sad or merry ?
Get thee away .
Then , good my lord , teach your cousin to consent winking .
Haply in private .
O , do not do your cousin such a wrong !
Will not he ?
What said he ?
Ha ' to thee , lad !
Here comes another troop to seek for you .
Be not offended .
Well this was Signor Benedick that said so .
Master , master !
Belike some noble gentleman that means , Traveling some journey , to repose him here .
By this sword , he that makes the first thrust , I'll kill him .
O , he is mad , Laertes .
Was 't you that did so oft contrive to kill him ?
Though I die for it , as no less is threatened me , the king my old master must be relieved .
There is so much that thou wilt kill me straight .
Who are the late commissioners ?
Lay forth the gown .
Tis heavy night , These may be counterfeits .
Farewell , good Launcelot .
I have this present evening from my sister Been well informed of them , and with such cautions That if they come to sojourn at my house I'll not be there .
My Lord of Cambridge , and my kind Lord of Masham , And you , my gentle knight , give me your thoughts .
Oh , come apace , dispatch !
And die in music .
Away , make haste .
Where's my knave , my fool ? , Go you , and call my fool hither .
We look for you tomorrow .
Come , put mine armor on .
I would they were , that I might die at once , For now they kill me with a living death .
He is arrived .
Whereby hangs a tale , sir ?
Can Fulvia die ?
This in the public eye ?
I do not like her name .
Though we have spent our harvest of this king , We are to reap the harvest of his son .
Come , away .
If thou wilt needs damn thyself , do it a more delicate way than drowning .
Prithee , peace .
This deed I'll do before this purpose cool .
Write me a prologue , and let the prologue seem to say we will do no harm with our swords , and that Pyramus is not killed indeed .
What do you call the play ?
Set your countenance , sir .
Com'st thou again for ransom ?
Come , bring me where they are .
I take it much unkindly That thou , Iago , who hast had my purse As if the strings were thine , shouldst know of this .
I did not think to draw my sword 'gainst Pompey , For he hath laid strange courtesies and great Of late upon me .
Say you ?
It is Captain Macmorris , is it not ?
Hast any philosophy in thee , shepherd ?
If this be so , why blame you me to love you ?
Let me have open means to come to them , And soon I'll rid you from the fear of them .
Ay , do you fear it ?
Be the Jacks fair within , the Jills fair without , the carpets laid , and everything in order ?
His father , though I say 't , is an honest exceeding poor man and , God be thanked , well to live .
Say that you love me not , but say not so In bitterness .
Nay , I dare not swear it .
Where's my fool , ho ?
What's the matter ?
He is at hand , and Pindarus is come To do you salutation from his master .
Thou 'lt be afraid to hear it .
Whisper her ear and tell her I and Ursula Walk in the orchard , and our whole discourse Is all of her .
Take you , as 'twere , some distant knowledge of him , As thus : "I know his father and his friends , And , in part , him." Do you mark this , Reynaldo ?
Follow , follow !
Tell not me .
And a true lover of the holy Church .
How shall we then behold their natural tears ?
I will fall prostrate at his feet And never rise until my tears and prayers Have won his grace to come in person hither And take perforce my husband from the Abbess .
Ay , madam .
Oh , that exceeds , they say .
That I was disdainful and that I had my good wit out of The Hundred Merry Tales !
Have you the lion's part written ?
O gull !
What , jealous Oberon ? , Fairies , skip hence .
But this is trifling , And all the more it seeks to hide itself The bigger bulk it shows .
Why not , my lord ?
I would I were senseless , sir , that I might not feel your blows .
I hear it now above me .
Yet is this no charm for the toothache. , Old Signior , walk aside with me .
Why have you left the chamber ?
Let go my hand .
The saddler had it , sir ; I kept it not .
Wonder not Nor be grieved .
Let's draw our weapons .
It is a letter from my brother that I have not all o'er-read .
Ha !
What is this That rises like the issue of a king , And wears upon his baby-brow the round And top of sovereignty ?
If , sir , perchance She have restrained the riots of your followers , 'T is on such ground and to such wholesome end As clears her from all blame .
Monster , I do smell all horse piss , at which my nose is in great indignation .
A more unhappy lady , If this division chance , ne'er stood between , Praying for both parts .
Fairy King , attend , and mark .
Well thought upon .
Now , good my lord , lie here and rest awhile .
They have tied me to a stake .
Happily , amen !
The music , ho !
In this last tempest .
First let us go to dinner .
By this , I think , the dial points at five .
I can not say "whore , " It does abhor me now I speak the word .
Yea , and text underneath : "Here dwells Benedick the married man" ?
We'll hear the will .
Thou must be patient .
Tis noble Kent , your friend .
He will do all in all as Hastings doth .
He is a good one , and his worthiness Does challenge much respect. , Come , Desdemona , Once more , well met at Cyprus .
Madam , good night .
You're welcome , sir , and he for your good sake .
When Jacob grazed his uncle Laban's sheep , This Jacob from our holy Abram was , As his wise mother wrought in his behalf , The third possessor , ay , he was the third , And what of him ?
And this way have you well expounded it .
Did you see him ?
A guiltless death I die .
Is this the king we sent to for his ransom ?
I this infer : That many things , having full reference To one consent , may work contrariously , As many arrows loosed several ways Come to one mark , as many ways meet in one town , As many fresh streams meet in one salt sea , As many lines close in the dial's center , So may a thousand actions , once afoot , End in one purpose , and be all well borne Without defeat .
Madam , I will .
What is the matter ?
Oh , heaven forgive me !
Now , good sir , what are you ?
Look , here comes a lover of mine and a lover of hers .
The foul practice Hath turned itself on me .
Why , our battalia trebles that account .
Hoo !
It is merely a lust of the blood and a permission of the will .
Due for a chain your husband had of him .
Who's there ?
Edgar I nothing am .
An inviting eye , and yet methinks right modest .
Now set the teeth and stretch the nostril wide , Hold hard the breath and bend up every spirit To his full height .
You are a councilor .
Untimely storms make men expect a dearth .
Follow me , then .
How !
If thou delight to view thy heinous deeds , Behold this pattern of thy butcheries .
They smile at me that shortly shall be dead .
This was the noblest Roman of them all .
Therefore I pray you That to our sister you do make return .
Wherefore speaks he this To her he hates ?
My lord ?
Nay , you must forget that .
Take up her bed And bear her women from the monument .
Ha !
The spring , the summer , The childing autumn , angry winter change Their wonted liveries , and the mazed world , By their increase , now knows not which is which .
Like one of two contending in a prize That thinks he hath done well in people's eyes , Hearing applause and universal shout , Giddy in spirit , still gazing in a doubt Whether these pearls of praise be his or no , So , thrice fair lady , stand I even so , As doubtful whether what I see be true Until confirmed , signed , ratified by you .
We'll mutiny .
My voice is ragged .
So do all thoughts .
What , my lord ?
Not that , I hope , which you received of me .
Which of these sorrows is he subject to ?
Should you do so , my lord , My speech should fall into such vile success Which my thoughts aimed not at .
A friend .
Strato , thou hast been all this while asleep .
The lady protests too much , methinks .
If a Jew wrong a Christian , what is his humility ?
Here is his Majesty .
She will not come .
If I dream not , thou art Emilia .
News , madam .
Goodman Verges , sir , speaks a little off the matter .
So fare you well at once , for Brutus ' tongue Hath almost ended his life's history .
I had thought t' have held it poor ; but since my lord Is Antony again , I will be Cleopatra .
There will we dine .
Yet I beseech you , If you think fit , or that it may be done , Give me advantage of some brief discourse With Desdemona alone .
Iras , long farewell .
You have known what you should not .
Doth not the gentleman Deserve as full as fortunate a bed As ever Beatrice shall couch upon ?
Mistake me not .
A little water clears us of this deed .
Weary sev'nnights nine times nine Shall he dwindle , peak and pine .
Therefore weep .
O Scotland , Scotland !
God and his angels guard your sacred throne And make you long become it .
Go , bind this man , for he is frantic too .
And from thy hated presence part I so .
And her sister By her is poisoned .
And so had I , but yet , for fashion sake , I thank you too for your society .
Come down .
Cleopatra , Do not abuse my master's bounty by Th' undoing of yourself .
Very good orators , when they are out , they will spit ; and for lovers lacking , God warn us , matter , the cleanliest shift is to kiss .
You have spoken truer than you purposed .
Tis bargained 'twixt us twain , being alone , That she shall still be curst in company .
Because we come to do you service and you think we are ruffians , you'll have your daughter covered with a Barbary horse .
Nay , you need not fear us , Lorenzo .
You need not fear , lady , the having any of these lords .
Ay , on mine honor .
What news , Borachio ?
You look not well , Signor Antonio .
Your servant Kent .
If I do prove her haggard , Though that her jesses were my dear heartstrings , I'd whistle her off and let her down the wind To prey at fortune .
The sight of lovers feedeth those in love .
Some villains of my court Are of consent and sufferance in this .
Oh , coward that I am , to live so long To see my best friend ta'en before my face !
You will take little delight in it , I can tell you , there is such odds in the man .
Oh , yet I do repent me of my fury , That I did kill them .
Heavens , I am the best of them that speak this speech , Were I but where 'tis spoken .
Thou hast seen a farmer's dog bark at a beggar ?
Tis the curse of service .
We will behold his death .
This man hath had good counsel , a hundred knights !
This speech of yours hath moved me , And shall perchance do good .
The heavens themselves blaze forth the death of princes .
But have you both forsworn me ?
Post-post-haste , dispatch .
You shall be king .
I must not say no .
The near in blood , The nearer bloody .
Thou speak'st wiser than thou art ware of .
Whereon I do beseech thee , grant me this , To leave me but a little to myself .
What is between you ?
O happy fair !
Even she : Leonato's Hero , your Hero , every man's Hero .
Now civil wounds are stopped , peace lives again .
Who does me this ?
Let it fall rather , though the fork invade The region of my heart .
But sup them well and look unto them all .
Is 't not denounced against us ?
Do so , good Messala .
But fare you well .
Well , well .
Men at some time are masters of their fates .
You shall have letters from me to my son In your behalf , to meet you on the way .
Rosalind of a better leer than you .
Think'st thou the fiery fever will go out With titles blown from adulation ?
In him your comfort lives .
Armed , brother ?
No , I'll not weep .
Well , then I shall see thee again ?
I'll join with black despair against my soul And to myself become an enemy .
Signior Baptista , my business asketh haste , And every day I can not come to woo .
What tributaries follow him to Rome To grace in captive bonds his chariot wheels ?
I will do any modest office , my lord , to help my cousin to a good husband .
Tis here .
There's no doubt his majesty Will soon recover his accustomed health .
Sconce" call you it ?
We will hear Caesar's will .
My Lord High Constable , the English lie within fifteen hundred paces of your tents .
Nor will do none tomorrow .
And then he offered it the third time .
Our separation so abides and flies That thou , residing here , goes yet with me , And I , hence fleeting , here remain with thee .
Nay , like enough , for I stay dinner there .
Here's the place .
So Caesar may .
Do not fear our person .
We'll have thee , as our rarer monsters are , Painted on a pole , and underwrit , "Here may you see the tyrant." I will not yield , To kiss the ground before young Malcolm's feet , And to be baited with the rabble's curse .
I must Once in a month recount what thou hast been , Which thou forget'st .
Oh , that I were a man for his sake !
I give him curses , yet he gives me love .
Horatio says 'tis but our fantasy And will not let belief take hold of him Touching this dreaded sight twice seen of us .
Fear you the boar , and go so unprovided ?
Take it and do 't , and leave me for this time .
Nay , but his jesting spirit , which is now crept into a lute string and now governed by stops , Indeed , that tells a heavy tale for him .
On the sixth hour , at which time , my lord , You said our work should cease .
Therefore , fair Hermia , question your desires .
And thereof came it that the man was mad .
But I have none .
This morning are they fled away and gone , And in their steads do ravens , crows , and kites Fly o'er our heads and downward look on us As we were sickly prey .
Well , come , my Kate .
And when I told thee he was of my counsel Of my whole course of wooing , thou cried'st "Indeed ? " And didst contract and purse thy brow together As if thou then hadst shut up in thy brain Some horrible conceit .
You are he , you are he .
Take that of me , my friend , who have the power To seal th ' accuser's lips .
Why is this reasoned ?
Speak .
Oh , 'tis treason !
Peace , children , peace .
I know not .
I think thou dost .
Why then , thou hast it .
Bar Harry England , that sweeps through our land With pennons painted in the blood of Harfleur .
Remember that you call on me today .
I must perforce .
The early village cock Hath twice done salutation to the morn .
Why , she defies me Like Turk to Christian .
Oh , woe the day !
Help , ho , help !
I would give all my fame for a pot of ale , and safety .
How now , Roderigo !
Madam , I wish it may .
I have no more sons of the royal blood For thee to slaughter .
There is further compliment of leave-taking between France and him .
By and by .
Nay , let them go , a couple of quiet ones .
If it assume my noble father's person , I'll speak to it , though Hell itself should gape And bid me hold my peace .
Counterfeit ?
I called thee then "vain flourish of my fortune." I called thee then poor shadow , "painted queen , " The presentation of but what I was , The flattering index of a direful pageant , One heaved a-high , to be hurled down below , A mother only mocked with two fair babes , A dream of what thou wast , a garish flag To be the aim of every dangerous shot , A sign of dignity , a breath , a bubble , A queen in jest , only to fill the scene .
Good repose the while !
No , by my life and soul !
Be gentle to her .
Pompey is strong at sea , And it appears he is beloved of those That only have feared Caesar .
Think you so ?
Impatient of my absence , And grief that young Octavius with Mark Antony Have made themselves so strong , for with her death That tidings came , with this she fell distract And , her attendants absent , swallowed fire .
But art thou not advised , he took some care To get her cunning schoolmasters to instruct her ?
That very hour , and in the selfsame inn , A meaner woman was delivered Of such a burden , male twins , both alike .
So is the dearest o ' th ' loss .
What infinite heart's ease Must kings neglect that private men enjoy ?
You should for that have reprehended him .
The gods make this a happy day to Antony !
Come , sweet Audrey .
Here I stand , your slave , A poor , infirm , weak , and despised old man .
I ' th ' mire .
Is all the counsel that we two have shared , The sisters ' vows , the hours that we have spent When we have chid the hasty-footed time For parting us , oh , is it all forgot ?
I must and will have Katherine to my wife .
Brother John Bates , is not that the morning which breaks yonder ?
Oh , wonder !
How now , my sweet Bianca !
Why , this is an arrant counterfeit rascal .
To her that is not here , nor doth not hear .
Then I would you were so honest a man .
I will not do thee so much wrong to wake thee .
I will physic your rankness and yet give no thousand crowns neither. , Holla , Dennis !
You taught me language , and my profit on 't Is I know how to curse .
Into my grave .
Never was monarch better feared and loved Than is your Majesty .
What , for a counter , would I do but good ?
Never did faithful subject more rejoice At the discovery of most dangerous treason Than I do at this hour joy o'er myself , Prevented from a damned enterprise .
Nay , I shall ne'er be ware of mine own wit till I break my shins against it .
Farewell .
Will it give place to flexure and low bending ?
The best ?
The galleys Have sent a dozen sequent messengers This very night at one another's heels , And many of the consuls , raised and met , Are at the Duke's already .
And do still , by these pickers and stealers .
And so fare thee well .
Wherefore ?
Will you go , sister ? , Shepherd , ply her hard .
O perdurable shame !
Descend , for you must be my torchbearer .
Oh , was she so ?
What , art thou afraid ?
Myself have letters of the selfsame tenor .
Good night , honest Iago .
For me , that I may surely keep mine oath , I will be married to a wealthy widow , Ere three days pass , which hath as long loved me As I have loved this proud disdainful haggard .
Nay , do not quarrel with us , good old man .
And yet I would not be thee , nuncle .
Oh , curse of marriage That we can call these delicate creatures ours And not their appetites !
Sweet Phoebe , do not scorn me .
Pooh , you speak like a green girl , Unsifted in such perilous circumstance .
How ?
What's the matter That you unlace your reputation thus And spend your rich opinion for the name Of a night-brawler ?
If he will take it , so .
Say , my spirit , How fares the king and 's followers ?
Sweet bodements !
Good morrow to you .
Is it not hard , Nerissa , that I can not choose one nor refuse none ?
Believe me , lord , I think he can not choose .
He is welcome hither .
On their sustaining garments not a blemish , But fresher than before .
Where is the number of our English dead ?
Dost thou hold there still ?
Nay , rather persuade him to hold his hands .
Or , if you borrow one another's love for the instant , you may , when you hear no more words of Pompey , return it again .
O , she would laugh me Out of myself , press me to death with wit .
So can I .
Lie with her , that's fulsome .
One of my fellows had the speed of him , Who , almost dead for breath , had scarcely more Than would make up his message .
If you outstay the time , upon mine honor And in the greatness of my word , you die .
I do believe it , and I ask your pardon .
Good sirs , take heart .
Of a strange nature is the suit you follow , Yet in such rule that the Venetian law Can not impugn you as you do proceed. , Ay , so he says .
I had rather have a handful or two of dried peas .
Is this true ?
Truly then I fear you are damned both by father and mother .
There , take it to you , trenchers , cups , and all !
Would I might But ever see that man !
The merchandise which thou hast brought from Rome Are all too dear for me .
O my heart !
Fare you well , sir .
Is the single man therefore blessed ?
Where the place ?
That is another simple sin in you , to bring the ewes and the rams together and to offer to get your living by the copulation of cattle ; to be bawd to a bellwether and to betray a she-lamb of a twelvemonth to a crooked-pated old cuckoldly ram , out of all reasonable match .
Had I before known this young man his son , I should have given him tears unto entreaties Ere he should thus have ventured .
What would my lord ?
To fetch my poor distracted husband hence .
Upon the right hand I .
Welcome , wanderer .
Let's follow .
You know my mind .
Has this fellow no feeling of his business ?
And most dear actors , eat no onions nor garlic , for we are to utter sweet breath .
You break jests as braggarts do their blades , which , God be thanked , hurt not. , My lord , for your many courtesies I thank you .
Some to Decius ' house and some to Casca's .
Tis true , my liege ; this ring I had of her .
Wert thou not my brother , I would not take this hand from thy throat till this other had pulled out thy tongue for saying so .
Where is that viper ?
My Lord of Warwick and my brother Gloucester , Follow Fluellen closely at the heels .
He was quick mettle when he went to school .
Do not you love me ?
For your father's remembrance , be at accord .
Tell the clock there .
I must be idle .
It is too late .
What's thy pleasure ?
Good morrow , General .
No , no .
Shall we part , sweet girl ?
Your daughter spent in Genoa , as I heard , in one night fourscore ducats .
Ay , and to wage this battle at Pharsalia , Where Caesar fought with Pompey .
Alas , poor country !
The King of Naples , being an enemy To me inveterate , hearkens my brother's suit , Which was that he , in lieu o ' th ' premises Of homage and I know not how much tribute , Should presently extirpate me and mine Out of the dukedom , and confer fair Milan With all the honors on my brother .
Will 't please your Mightiness to wash your hands ?
But who comes here ?
Their hands and faces were all badged with blood .
Do you question me as an honest man should do , for my simple true judgment ?
Yet if thou say Antony lives , is well , Or friends with Caesar , or not captive to him , I'll set thee in a shower of gold and hail Rich pearls upon thee .
Why , then , tomorrow I can not serve your turn for Rosalind ?
Go to your rest .
As the cony that you see dwell where she is kindled .
Take thy fair hour , Laertes .
What need'st thou run so many mile about When thou mayst tell thy tale the nearest way ?
She shall not .
I would not change it .
And come with naked swords .
Ready .
Thisbe ?
For Edward , for my brother , for his sake .
Thanks , good Egeus .
Unfought withal , but I will sell my dukedom To buy a slobb'ry and a dirty farm In that nook-shotten isle of Albion .
The Jew shall have all justice .
Twenty crowns .
What else ?
Though that the queen on special cause is here , Her army is moved on .
Be aidant and remediate In the good man's distress .
Antonio shall become bound , well .
Then belike my children shall have no names .
Twill be a good way , and tomorrow the wrestling is .
The boy was the very staff of my age , my very prop .
Shall we shog ?
Sir , being his knave , I will .
Proceed , Solinus , to procure my fall , And by the doom of death end woes and all .
All thy other titles thou hast given away that thou wast born with .
All this amazement can I qualify When after that the holy rites are ended I'll tell you largely of fair Hero's death .
Hence , make your best of it .

Pray now , rest yourself .
My lord .
Three and three , We'll hold a feast in great solemnity .
Away , then .
I never saw my father in my life .
Fire and brimstone !
Music i' th' air .
Stay yet .
But , I pray you , let none of your people stir me .
Belike this show imports the argument of the play .
Though I am mad , I will not bite him .
Fie , Demetrius !
Oh , they take the part of a better wrestler than myself .
So our leader's led , And we are women's men .
Melt Egypt into Nile , and kindly creatures Turn all to serpents .
See , see , our honored hostess !
Or shall I say her uncle ?
Now go to the door and stay there till we call .
Like her ?
O Cleopatra !
My lord , I take my leave .
Thou hast , Ventidius , that Without the which a soldier and his sword Grants scarce distinction .
Here at your service .
If till the expiration of your month , You will return and sojourn with my sister , Dismissing half your train , come then to me .
Your old smock brings forth a new petticoat , and indeed the tears live in an onion that should water this sorrow .
The Lord protect him from that kingly title !
What then ?
Tis with cares .
Not I , believe me .
I know that , but I would have thee hence and here again .
After dinner Your hazard shall be made .
He is called Aunchient Pistol .
All which we pine for now .
Against my will I am sent to bid you come in to dinner." There's a double meaning in that .
I am qualmish at the smell of leek .
Help , angels .
Here comes two of the banished duke's pages .
Wake Duncan with thy knocking .
Dat it is not be de fashion pour les ladies of France , I can not tell wat is To kiss .
Good now , hold thy tongue .
He hath made me a Christian .
Let him cry , "Praise and glory on his head ! " For forth he goes and visits all his host , Bids them good morrow with a modest smile , And calls them brothers , friends , and countrymen .
Thou didst it excellent .
Thou art Dromio , thou art my man , thou art thyself .
Faith , sir , you need not fear .
Tell your piteous heart There's no harm done .
And then the justice , In fair round belly with good capon lined , With eyes severe and beard of formal cut , Full of wise saws and modern instances ; And so he plays his part .
An oath of mickle might , and fury shall abate .
There are the players .
Go you and tell her of it .
Five hundred poor I have in yearly pay , Who twice a day their withered hands hold up Toward heaven to pardon blood .
Will it never be day ?
But there's no goodness in thy face , if Antony Be free and healthful , so tart a favor To trumpet such good tidings !
You've said , sir .
All this" ?
Why , every day , tomorrow .
I pray you stand good father to me now .
Victory sits on our helms .
Madam , undress you and come now to bed .
Our gracious brother , I will go with them .
Most high , most mighty , and most puissant Caesar , Metellus Cimber throws before thy seat An humble heart , I must prevent thee , Cimber .
The skies are painted with unnumbered sparks .
She hath the stones upon her , and the ducats." Why , all the boys in Venice follow him , Crying , "His stones , his daughter , and his ducats ! "
Here is the man .
It is no boast , being asked , to say we are .
Is your name Shylock ?
Dear lady , welcome home .
And till the tears that she hath shed for thee Like envious floods o'errun her lovely face , She was the fairest creature in the world , And yet she is inferior to none .
But she , your subject , loathes such sovereignty .
Happy were England would this virtuous prince Take on his grave the sovereignty thereof .
More knocking .
Yes , one place else , if you will hear me name it .
This not to do , So grace and mercy at your most need help you , Swear .
A southwest blow on ye And blister you all o'er !
Heard you this , Gonzalo ?
O Julius Caesar , thou art mighty yet !
There's no clock in the forest .
Is he well ?
The news is true , my lord .
Let us not burden our remembrances with A heaviness that's gone .
My deeds upon my head .
Unarm , Eros .
Most noble Empress , you have heard of me ?
Away , and mock the time with fairest show .
Come , sir , to dinner. , Dromio , keep the gate .
And for my love I pray you wrong me not .
Come , thou mortal wretch , With thy sharp teeth this knot intrinsicate Of life at once untie .
Big Mars seems bankrupt in their beggared host And faintly through a rusty beaver peeps .
The gold I gave to Dromio is laid up Safe at the Centaur , and the heedful slave Is wandered forth , in care to seek me out .
Look you who comes here , a young man and an old in solemn talk .
Read the will .
Relent ?
If they make you not then the better answer , you may say they are not the men you took them for .
But now in the division of the kingdom , it appears not which of the dukes he values most , for equalities are so weighed that curiosity in neither can make choice of either's moiety .
In such a time as this it is not meet That every nice offense should bear his comment .
Macbeth Is ripe for shaking , and the powers above Put on their instruments .
How low am I , thou painted maypole ?
At five o'clock I shall receive the money for the same .
Yes , they have .
Mean you his majesty ?
Answer me in one word .
Hence !
Hail , gentle sir .
Exclaim no more against it .
We had much more monstrous matter of feast , which worthily deserved noting .
Would I were in an alehouse in London !
Now I am alone .
And what of him , Tranio ?
I shall laugh myself to death at this puppy-headed monster .
I grant him bloody , Luxurious , avaricious , false , deceitful , Sudden , malicious , smacking of every sin That has a name .
Make your best use of this .
You swore to me when I did give it you That you would wear it till your hour of death , And that it should lie with you in your grave .
No passage ?
Ay , Lepidus .
Yet Caesar shall go forth , for these predictions Are to the world in general as to Caesar .
I'll make so bold to call , For 'tis my limited service .
Thou liest , abhorred tyrant .
O brave touch !
But , sirrah , not for my sake , but your master's , I advise You use your manners discreetly in all kind of companies .
What hath he said ?
I do obey thee till I give thee bail .
You look as you had something more to say .
He knows not yet of his honorable fortune .
That head , my lord ?
O , sixpence , that I had o ' Wednesday last To pay the saddler for my mistress ' crupper ?
Hail !
O Cassius , Far from this country Pindarus shall run , Where never Roman shall take note of him .
Do you know me , Father ?
Hearty thanks .
Who is 't that cried ?
I am not well .
Jailer , look to him .
I would speak with Clarence , and I came hither on my legs .
You do not mind the play .
The question of his death is enrolled in the Capitol .
My mother .
Had I but died an hour before this chance , I had lived a blessed time , for from this instant There's nothing serious in mortality .
I know her by her gait .
Most kind messenger , Say to great Caesar this in deputation : I kiss his conqu'ring hand .
What wicked and dissembling glass of mine Made me compare with Hermia's sphery eyne ?
But soft , behold !
Arise , you shall not kneel .
He hath not told his thought to the king ?
I knew a wench married in an afternoon as she went to the garden for parsley to stuff a rabbit , and so may you , sir .
I shall break The cause of our expedience to the Queen And get her leave to part .
Thou'dst shun a bear , But if thy flight lay toward the raging sea Thou'dst meet the bear i ' th ' mouth .
Good night to you .
What means this shouting ?
I rest much bounden to you .
I am a king , my masters , know you that ?
Do not think it so unwholesome .
I think the sun where he was born Drew all such humors from him .
Here's a maze trod indeed Through forthrights and meanders .
Good my sovereign , Take up the English short , and let them know Of what a monarchy you are the head .
Sorrow breaks seasons and reposing hours , Makes the night morning , and the noontide night .
Tis noble spoken .
How do you all at Verona ?
Offended us you have not , but the king .
All this my sister is , or else should be .
Let him bless thee too .
And I for Rosalind .
He did bewray his practice , and received This hurt you see striving to apprehend him .
For the heavens , he shows me where the bachelors sit , and there live we as merry as the day is long .
Well , madam , and in health .
With what addition ?
That's strange .
Why , then , let them alone till they are sober .
Look how thy servants do attend on thee , Each in his office ready at thy beck .
I know it is the moon .
Thou hast seen these signs .
Here comes my messenger. , How now , mad spirit ?
And God forbid , my dear and faithful lord , That you should fashion , wrest , or bow your reading , Or nicely charge your understanding soul With opening titles miscreate , whose right Suits not in native colors with the truth ; For God doth know how many now in health Shall drop their blood in approbation
In the great hand of God I stand , and thence Against the undivulged pretense I fight Of treasonous malice .
From henceforth I will , coz , and devise sports .
Because I would not see thy cruel nails Pluck out his poor old eyes , nor thy fierce sister In his anointed flesh stick boarish fangs .
Ay .
He's bound unto Octavia .
Madam , here comes my lord .
Faith , niece , you tax Signor Benedick too much , but he'll be meet with you , I doubt it not .
It is now two o'clock .
Lives , sir .
Faith , sir , so-so .
We'll bring him to his house with shouts and clamors .
And what your Highness suffered under that shape , I beseech you take it for your own fault and not mine , for , had you been as I took you for , I made no offense .
No .
I will not sleep , my lord , till I have delivered your letter .
What say'st thou , noble heart ?
Your overkindness doth wring tears from me .
Marry , we were sent for to the justices .
Still did I tell him it was vile and bad .
Go with me to the duchess .
And smelt so ?
Ay , boy .
I am come To bid my king and master aye good night .
I do not desire he should answer for me , and yet I determine to fight lustily for him .
Give me thy hand .
No evil lost is wailed when it is gone .
I thank you , sir .
Be attentive .
What's he that speaks for Edmund , Earl of Gloucester ?
Indeed , they say the senators tomorrow Mean to establish Caesar as a king , And he shall wear his crown by sea and land In every place save here in Italy .
I hate the Moor , And it is thought abroad that 'twixt my sheets He's done my office .
Take up the bodies .
I was with Hercules and Cadmus once , When in a wood of Crete they bayed the bear With hounds of Sparta .
What features ?
Full many a lady I have eyed with best regard and many a time
Monster , come , put some lime upon your fingers , and away with the rest .
Cassius , go you into the other street And part the numbers .
Worthy Montano , you were wont be civil .
This same is she , and I do give you her .
And me too , good Lord !
I am glad he's come , howsoe'er he comes .
Dromio , what stuff of mine hast thou embarked ?
Do so .
What is it , my good friends ?
Under a compelling occasion , let women die .
Nor will you tender less .
O day and night , but this is wondrous strange !
But I'll see you soon .
Ay , my lord .
All ?
Tis far off , And rather like a dream than an assurance That my remembrance warrants .
Now must your conscience my acquaintance seal , And you must put me in your heart for friend , Sith you have heard , and with a knowing ear , That he which hath your noble father slain Pursued my life .
He hath the falling sickness .
My friends told me as much , and I thought no less .
Not stingless too ?
The bounty and the benison of heaven To boot and boot .
An angel is like you , Kate , and you are like an angel .
Why do people love you ?
Till which encounter It is my business too .
Is this the Prince's brother ?
Throw this slave Upon the dunghill. , Regan , I bleed apace .
What stay had we but Clarence ?
What , we have many goodly days to see !
Bid your friends welcome , show a merry cheer .
We two alone will sing like birds i ' th ' cage .
I go ; and towards three or four o'clock Look for the news that the Guildhall affords .
At last , a little shaking of mine arm And thrice his head thus waving up and down , He raised a sigh so piteous and profound As it did seem to shatter all his bulk And end his being .
Thus it must be .
Be thou assured , good Cassio , I will do All my abilities in thy behalf .
You were best knock louder .
No , faith , hate him not , for my sake .
Go to .
Murellus and Flavius , for pulling scarfs off Caesar's images , are put to silence .
Oh , thy vile lady !
Perchance he will not mind me .
I mean , in a sort .
And so say I .
My Regan counsels well .
Sir , sooth to say , you did not dine at home .
O , quicken them with thine !
Peace , fool .
When the butt is out , we will drink water .
This cold night will turn us all to fools and madmen .
Your Grace may do your pleasure .
Wake her not .
I would not be cured , youth .
There is your money that I had to keep .
Or say , sweet love , what thou desirest to eat .
With Demetrius .
He said mine eyes were black and my hair black And , now I am remembered , scorned at me .
Even now , now , very now , an old black ram Is tupping your white ewe .
Mine was not bridled .
Against my will , I am sent to bid you come in to dinner .
Well then , no more but this : go , gentle Catesby , And , as it were far off , sound thou Lord Hastings How he doth stand affected to our purpose And summon him tomorrow to the Tower To sit about the coronation .
Twill be naught , But let it be .
But I will not stir from this place , do what they can .
Lo , here's the chain .
Note if your lady strain his entertainment
Why then , can one desire too much of a good thing ? , Come , sister , you shall be the priest and marry us. , Give me your hand , Orlando. , What do you say , sister ?
The itch of his affection should not then Have nicked his captainship at such a point When half to half the world opposed , he being The mered question .
They could be content To visit other places , and come down With fearful bravery , thinking by this face To fasten in our thoughts that they have courage .
I am so lated in the world that I Have lost my way forever .
Peace , ho !
Here's sport indeed !
Who can come in and say that I mean her , When such a one as she such is her neighbor ?
Madam , madam , Antonio's dead !
No , not so , villain , thou beliest thyself .
Ay , at Philippi .
I warrant you .
So turns she every man the wrong side out And never gives to truth and virtue that Which simpleness and merit purchaseth .
I do not well know , my lord .
Shall we go , coz ?
Here's to Caesar .
They could not , would not do 't .
Not sick , my lord , unless it be in mind , Nor well , unless in mind .
O , preposterous And frantic outrage , end thy damned spleen , Or let me die , to look on death no more .
Save means to live .
I think it be , sir .
What then ?
Prithee , if thou lovest me , tell me .
May I never To this good purpose , that so fairly shows , Dream of impediment !
Master , some show to welcome us to town .
Ay , so we will .
Be pleased to tell us , For this is from the present , how you take The offers we have sent you .
What are you ?
Now , Catesby , what says his grace ?
We are the makers of manners , Kate , and the liberty that follows our places stops the mouth of all find- faults , as I will do yours for upholding the nice fashion of your country in denying me a kiss .
But , God be thanked , there is no need of me , And much I need to help you , were there need .
In the meantime , Let me be thought too busy in my fears , As worthy cause I have to fear I am , And hold her free , I do beseech your honor .
I can see a church by daylight .
I pray thee , peace .
Go , And with your speediest bring us what she says And how you find of her .
Plain and not honest is too harsh a style .
Will you dine with me tomorrow ?
Some villain hath done me wrong .
I say "thy husband" , dost understand the word ?
O Phoebe , Phoebe , Phoebe !
What dost thou know me for ?
The leisure and the fearful time Cuts off the ceremonious vows of love And ample interchange of sweet discourse , Which so-long-sundered friends should dwell upon .
Oh , it offends me to the soul to hear a robustious periwig-pated fellow tear a passion to tatters , to very rags , to split the ears of the groundlings , who for the most part are capable of nothing but inexplicable dumb-shows and noise .
It is very true .
I loved him , friend , No father his son dearer .
How do you , sir ?
His soldiership Is twice the other twain .
He's as good at anything and yet a fool .
Why , the honest men .
Get on your nightgown , lest occasion call us And show us to be watchers .
But for the bloody napkin ?
O Regan , wilt thou take her by the hand ?
It proves not so .
Horrible sight !
No more perchance does mine , nor his , nor hers .
Give you good night .
Yonder they lie , the poor old man their father making such pitiful dole over them that all the beholders take his part with weeping .
Good Margaret , run thee to the parlor .
That eye my daughter lent her ; 'tis most true .
She did indeed .
Well , again .
It is to be all made of faith and service , And so am I for Phoebe .
Thou hast harped my fear aright .
I'll signify so much unto him straight .
Why , that is nothing .
And , gentle friends , Let's kill him boldly but not wrathfully .
Now I must To the young man send humble treaties , dodge And palter in the shifts of lowness , who With half the bulk o' th' world played as I pleased , Making and marring fortunes .
I have deceived even your very eyes .
Go and importune her .
I was about to protest I loved you .
Since that respects and fortunes are his love , I shall not be his wife .
Why look you pale ?
Tis paltry to be Caesar .
As he was valiant , I honor him .
I can not but remember such things were That were most precious to me .
Captain Macmorris , I beseech you now , will you voutsafe me , look you , a few disputations with you as partly touching or concerning the disciplines of the war , the Roman wars ?
Art thou my son ?
Decius , go tell them Caesar will not come .
Well then , sustain me .
The other half comes to the general state , Which humbleness may drive unto a fine .
The son of Clarence have I pent up close , His daughter meanly have I matched in marriage , The sons of Edward sleep in Abraham's bosom , And Anne my wife hath bid this world goodnight .
Can anything be made of this ?
But yet It is our trick .
A gentle riddance. , Draw the curtains , go. , Let all of his complexion choose me so .
You told a lie , an odious , damned lie .
I am the king himself .
Horns ?
Her name is Margery , indeed .
Her length of sickness , with what else more serious Importeth thee to know , this bears .
Lepidus is high-colored .
I will not desire that .
God and your arms be praised , victorious friends !
Enjoy the honey-heavy dew of slumber .
Nay , but hear me .
If she be a traitor , Why so am I .
Why , so I did .
Set it down .
Past all expressing .
There is none but he Whose being I do fear , and under him My genius is rebuked , as it is said Mark Antony's was by Caesar .
Not where he eats , but where he is eaten .
And when please you to say so ?
For you see , it is already in snuff .
What is the news ?
Stand , you neat slave , strike !
How I dote on thee !
I am very ill at ease , Unfit for mine own purposes .
This were kindness .
To suckle fools and chronicle small beer .
Have I , my lord ?
Ophelia , walk you here .
Your commission's ready .
Pat , pat .
My lord and brother , God save you .
My liege , I am advised what I say , Neither disturbed with the effect of wine , Nor heady-rash , provoked with raging ire , Albeit my wrongs might make one wiser mad .
Fare you well .
God 'ild you , sir .
You take my life When you do take the means whereby I live .
Swear priests and cowards and men cautelous , Old feeble carrions and such suffering souls That welcome wrongs .
Portia , adieu .
No , I will be the pattern of all patience .
Alas , what danger will it be to us , Maids as we are , to travel forth so far ?
Let them be hunted soundly .
Call my train together. , Degenerate bastard , I'll not trouble thee .
One speech in it I chiefly loved .
But , like the owner of a foul disease , To keep it from divulging , let it feed Even on the pith of life .
And for the sake of them thou sorrowest for , Do me the favour to dilate at full What hath befall'n of them and thee till now .
Say that I slew them not .
But , my good lord , this boy is forest-born And hath been tutored in the rudiments Of many desperate studies by his uncle , Whom he reports to be a great magician Obscured in the circle of this forest .
It is to be all made of fantasy , All made of passion and all made of wishes , All adoration , duty , and observance , All humbleness , all patience and impatience , All purity , all trial , all observance , And so am I for Phoebe .
A very fine one .
Nay then , I will not .
Oh , she is Ten times more gentle than her father's crabbed , And he's composed of harshness .
I know this is a joyful trouble to you , But yet 'tis one .
And if tomorrow Our navy thrive , I have an absolute hope Our landmen will stand up .
The most infectious pestilence upon thee !
But these can not I command to any utterance of harmony .
Do you sing it , and I'll dance it .
Hold , take thou that and that .
By my troth , he'll yield the crow a pudding one of these days .
Give me the daggers .
Go with me .
But we have reason to cool our raging motions , our carnal stings , our unbitted lusts .
I'll not endure it .
Not in this land shall he remain uncaught .
I will plague them all , Even to roaring .
We have engaged ourselves too far .
The earth hath bubbles , as the water has , And these are of them .
Bring me to Octavius .
I saw the handkerchief .
You shall hear me .
What will hap more tonight , safe 'scape the king !
Well , honor is the subject of my story .
What malice was between you ?
Oh , If you but knew how you the purpose cherish Whiles thus you mock it !
For us , we will consider of this further .
Yea , marry , let them come before me .
What Tranio did , myself enforced him to .
Do you like me , Kate ?
Nothing will come of nothing .
Too old to be engaged to young .
Ay , to the proof , as mountains are for winds , That shakes not , though they blow perpetually .
Sometime a horse I'll be , sometime a hound , A hog , a headless bear , sometime a fire .
Such a one Am I to fear , or none .
Why , if two gods should play some heavenly match And on the wager lay two earthly women , And Portia one , there must be something else Pawned with the other , for the poor rude world Hath not her fellow .
Marry , now I can tell .
Tubal , a wealthy Hebrew of my tribe , Will furnish me .
Let me play the lion too .
Marry , as for Clarence , he is well repaid ; He is franked up to fatting for his pains .
This I made good to you In our last conference , passed in probation with you , How you were borne in hand , how crossed , the instruments , Who wrought with them , and all things else that might To half a soul and to a notion crazed Say , "Thus did Banquo." You made it known to us .
What will I do , think'st thou ?
Oh , then belike she was old and gentle , and you rode , like a kern of Ireland , your French hose off and in your straight strossers .
Farewell , my lords .
Are you of good or evil ?
Did I not bid thee meet me in the park And bring along these rascal knaves with thee ?
Thou makest me merry .
Tis done already , and the messenger gone .
You are merry , my lord .
For I tell you , father , I am as peremptory as she proud-minded ; And where two raging fires meet together , They do consume the thing that feeds their fury .
I pray thee , let us go and find him out And quicken his embraced heaviness With some delight or other .
It were good that Benedick knew of it by some other , if she will not discover it .
Oh , Caesar , This Charmian lived but now .
And when that time comes , Afflict me with thy mocks , pity me not , As till that time I shall not pity thee .
Borachio .
What night-rule now about this haunted grove ?
I doubt not of his temperance .
Whose tongue ?
I'll fetch the general's surgeon. , Save you your labor. , He that lies slain here , Cassio , Was my dear friend .
Where is your husband ?
May a man do it ?
But thine doth fry .
Why seek'st thou me ?
I dare not confess that lest I should compare with him in excellence , but to know a man well were to know himself .
Why , to put 's head in , not to give it away to his daughters and leave his horns without a case .
So much for praising myself , who , I myself will bear witness , is praiseworthy .
Be simple-answered , for we know the truth .
No .
Fight valiantly today .
And thus a while the fit will work on him .
Set your heart at rest .
Here lay Duncan , His silver skin laced with his golden blood , And his gashed stabs looked like a breach in nature For ruin's wasteful entrance ; there , the murderers , Steeped in the colors of their trade , their daggers Unmannerly breeched with gore .
Ah , for my husband , for my dear lord Edward !
What foul play had we that we came from thence ?
We shall be the more marketable. , Bonjour , Monsieur Le Beau .
Bring him away .
But , oh , vain boast !
I your commission will forthwith dispatch , And he to England shall along with you .
I'll buckler thee against a million .
Therefore all hearts in love use their own tongues .
He's that he is .
With much , much more dismay I view the fight than thou that makest the fray .
You hear how he importunes me .
Madam , not yet .
Where is she now ? , What , will these hands ne'er be clean ? , No more o ' that , my lord , no more o ' that .
Ay , lord .
I thank thee .
As ever you come of women , come in quickly to Sir John .
You shall see anon how the murderer gets the love of Gonzago's wife .
Prithee , do not turn me about .
He is of note .
Now quit you well. , Torches , torches !
No place will please me so , no mean of death , As here by Caesar , and by you cut off , The choice and master spirits of this age .
Fulvia ?
Stanley , what news with you ?
No , I warrant you .
And can you by no drift of conference Get from him why he puts on this confusion , Grating so harshly all his days of quiet With turbulent and dangerous lunacy ?
As love is , my lord , before it loves .
And for my means , I'll husband them so well , They shall go far with little .
Despise me If I do not .
They must lie there .
Sweet Prince , why speak not you ?
Did you not speak to it ?
Nothing , Messala .
Say that she rail ; why then I'll tell her plain She sings as sweetly as a nightingale .
God has given you one face and you make yourselves another .
And how like you this shepherd's life , Master Touchstone ?
Shall Kate be my wife ?
O earth , which this blood drink'st revenge his death !
Awake , sir , awake .
Give mine the benefit of seigniory , And let my griefs frown on the upper hand .
I would thou hadst told me of another father .
Poor Tom shall lead thee .
Methinks thy voice is altered , and thou speak'st In better phrase and matter than thou didst .
Where are these hearts ?
Why , get you gone !
But I remember now I am in this earthly world , where to do harm Is often laudable , to do good sometime Accounted dangerous folly .
Well , well , well .
Therefore be o ' good cheer , for truly I think you are damned .
Spirits , which by mine art I have from their confines called to enact My present fancies .
And so of men .
Speak .
Friend Launcelot , what's the news ?
She well instructs me .
Open , locks , Whoever knocks .
I can see yet without spectacles , and I see no such matter .
But repetition of what thou hast marred .
What , master , read you ?
Where art thou , keeper ?
Why , thy godhead laid apart , Warr'st thou with a woman's heart ?
Let's have no more of this , let's to our affairs. , Forgive us our sins ! , Gentlemen , let's look to our business .
Why , true , he means to make a puppet of thee .
Poor I am but his stale .
I did her wrong , Canst tell how an oyster makes his shell ?
Lest it make you choleric and purchase me another dry basting .
In all these circumstances I'll instruct you .
I'll set her on .
Alack , alack !
O excellent device , and make a sop of him .
Do we all holy rites .
This gentleman will out-talk us all .
Between who ?
Take not the quarrel from His powerful arm ; He needs no indirect or lawless course To cut off those that have offended Him .
Bring him , dead or living , Within this twelvemonth or turn thou no more To seek a living in our territory .
Speak not so grossly. , You are all amazed .
With all my heart , and it doth much content me To hear him so inclined .
Did you say with Cassio ?
There I deny my land service .
Not now to hear thee sing .
All the East , Say thou , shall call her mistress." So he nodded , And soberly did mount an arm-gaunt steed , Who neighed so high that what I would have spoke Was beastly dumbed by him .
For your coming in to dinner , sir , why , let it be as humours and conceits shall govern .
Now , banished Kent , If thou canst serve where thou dost stand condemned , So may it come thy master , whom thou lovest , Shall find thee full of labors .
The ingratitude of this Seleucus does Even make me wild .
Soundly , my lord .
Do not laugh at me , For as I am a man , I think this lady To be my child Cordelia .
Caesar and Antony have ever won More in their officer than person .
Something we will determine .
I hope better .
No .
This dream is all amiss interpreted .
Such news , my lord , as grieves me to report .
Never , till Caesar's three and thirty wounds Be well avenged , or till another Caesar Have added slaughter to the sword of traitors .
Can you blame her then , being a maid yet rosed over with the virgin crimson of modesty , if she deny the appearance of a naked blind boy in her naked seeing self ?
For the most part , too , they are foolish that are so .
They say Edgar , his banished son , is with the Earl of Kent in Germany .
What's done is done .
Why , so didst thou .
But to my mind , though I am native here And to the manner born , it is a custom More honored in the breach than the observance .
What can it not ?
Well met here .
Why should I not ?
Alas , what does this gentleman conceive ?
Amen , if you love her , for the lady is very well worthy .
I see the business .
And so in me , and so , I think , in all .

They told me I was everything .
Tomorrow , Before the sun shall see 's , we'll spill the blood That has today escaped .
I like him very well .
Ay me !
He was not merry , Which seemed to tell them his remembrance lay In Egypt with his joy , but between both .
Thrice he walked By their oppressed and fear-surprised eyes Within his truncheon's length , whilst they , distilled Almost to jelly with the act of fear , Stand dumb and speak not to him .
I would the lightning had Burnt up those logs that you are enjoined to pile !
Himself .
What is his name ?

Mock not , Enobarbus .

Now , fair befall thee , good Petruchio !
Shall I have some water ? , Come , Kate , and wash , and welcome heartily. , You whoreson villain !
We'll lead you thither .
Where lodges he ?
Amen .
Come , sit , sit , and a song .
Why then , to thee , thou silver treasure house .
I marvel our mild husband Not met us on the way .
Nay , then , thus : We came into the world like brother and brother , And now let's go hand in hand , not one before another .
The night has been unruly .
To be now a sensible man , by and by a fool , and presently a beast !
Self-love , my liege , is not so vile a sin As self-neglecting .
Now , by the world , 'T is full of thy foul wrongs .
These lily lips , This cherry nose , These yellow cowslip cheeks Are gone , are gone .
When shall he come ?
Ah , my good lord , what have I seen tonight !
Peace !
Now , where's your master ?
Who was last with them ?
Is 't come to this ?
It is even so .
All , all .
A spirit ?
For when she saw , Which never shall be found , you did suspect She had disposed with Caesar , and that your rage Would not be purged , she sent you word she was dead .
Tis too bad , too bad .
And did you leave him in this contemplation ?
Hail .
Love news , in faith ?
Why , how now , Dromio .
Therefore be cheered .
My lord , I claim the gift , my due by promise , For which your honor and your faith is pawned , Th ' earldom of Hereford and the movables Which you promised I shall possess .
Tell him , when that our princely father York Blessed his three sons with his victorious arm , He little thought of this divided friendship .
Where art thou , Pindarus ?
Why should that name be sounded more than yours ?
He is coming .
Will you come to bed , my lord ?
And turns the sun to shade .
Madam , I had rather , I know your lady does not love her husband .
Nay , but I know who loves him .
The lamentable change is from the best ; The worst returns to laughter .
What is 't , my lord ?
We hope to make the sender blush at it .
My brother hath a daughter , Almost the copy of my child that's dead , And she alone is heir to both of us .
Nay , I know not .

So the maid that stood in the way for my wish shall show me the way to my will .
It is called Wye at Monmouth , but it is out of my prains what is the name of the other river .
Service .
If trembling I inhabit then , protest me The baby of a girl .
I am very glad to see you .
Is 't not the king ?
In the meantime , let me be that I am , and seek not to alter me .
But it would warm his spirits To hear from me you had left Antony And put yourself under his shroud , The universal landlord .
And I would I could find in my heart that I had not a hard heart , for truly I love none .
Come out o ' th ' storm .
Did I not tell you she was innocent ?
Bid me tear the bond .
They follow the king's pleasure .
I can , at any unseasonable instant of the night , appoint her to look out at her lady's chamber window .
Pompey Thrives in our idleness .
O madam , madam , madam !
Fare thee well , nymph .
Where they most breed and haunt , I have observed , The air is delicate .
I remember The first time ever Caesar put it on .
If we are marked to die , we are enough To do our country loss ; and if to live , The fewer men , the greater share of honor .
And yesternight , at supper , You suddenly arose and walked about , Musing and sighing , with your arms across , And when I asked you what the matter was , You stared upon me with ungentle looks .
By my faith , you have great reason to be sad .
Is it honest in deed and word ?
What it should be , More than his father's death , that thus hath put him So much from th ' understanding of himself , I can not dream of .
Not Cassio killed !
You are an ass , you are an ass !
O noble lord , bethink thee of thy birth , Call home thy ancient thoughts from banishment , And banish hence these abject lowly dreams .
Tomorrow We'll hear ourselves again .
I must leave you .
Look down , you gods , And on this couple drop a blessed crown , For it is you that have chalked forth the way Which brought us hither .
Kent banished thus ?
My lord , I am for you , though it cost me ten nights ' watchings .
My men should call me "lord." I am your goodman .
Here is the place , my lord .
Nay , I will do so .
I dare pawn down my life for him that he hath wrote this to feel my affection to your honor and to no other pretense of danger .
Pardon me .
Those that have known the earth so full of faults .
And all for nothing , For Hecuba !
Let her be thine , for we Have no such daughter , nor shall ever see That face of hers again .
You shall , Mark Antony .
What is the matter here ?
What ?
Dear my lord , if you in your own proof Have vanquished the resistance of her youth And made defeat of her virginity , I know what you would say : if I have known her , You will say she did embrace me as a husband , And so extenuate the forehand sin .
Sir , would she give you so much of her lips As of her tongue she oft bestows on me , You'll have enough .
Let 't be so , good Corporal Nym .
To have a foolish wife .
Nay , I'll go with thee , cheek by jowl .
Puppet" ?
I will be bitter with him and passing short .
Here .
If there be any good thing to be done That may to thee do ease and grace to me , Speak to me .
Filth , thou liest !
But all the charms of love , Salt Cleopatra , soften thy wanned lip !
I thank you , sir .
Once more remove , good friends .
I do not think so .
If so , then be not tongue-tied .
I pray you , what thinks he of our estate ?
He hath not touched you yet .
Braved in mine own house with a skein of thread ?
He doth indeed show some sparks that are like wit .
But were I Brutus , And Brutus Antony , there were an Antony Would ruffle up your spirits and put a tongue In every wound of Caesar that should move The stones of Rome to rise and mutiny .
No ?
No , great king .
What , not to pray ?
What , girl , though gray Do something mingle with our younger brown , yet ha' we A brain that nourishes our nerves and can Get goal for goal of youth .
There's the respect That makes calamity of so long life .
But , Lepidus , go you to Caesar's house .
I'll warrant him for drowning though the ship were no stronger than a nutshell and as leaky as an unstanched wench .
I am not married , Caesar .
Swell , bosom , with thy fraught , For 'tis of aspics ' tongues !
Not all the dukes of waterish Burgundy Can buy this unprized precious maid of me. , Bid them farewell , Cordelia , though unkind .
The drink , the drink !
You must awhile be patient .
Tis strange .
Have patience , sir .
Tis well for thee That , being unseminared , thy freer thoughts May not fly forth of Egypt .
My young remembrance can not parallel A fellow to it .
Have not you love enough to bear with me , When that rash humor which my mother gave me Makes me forgetful ?
I go .
Oh , heaven forgive us !
Come they of noble family ?
With all my heart , and much it joys me too To see you are become so penitent. , Tressel and Berkeley , go along with me .
Lurk , lurk .
What treasure , uncle ?
Why Doth it not then our eyelids sink ?
Thou runaway , thou coward , art thou fled ?
Not a word of me .
Good name in man and woman , dear my lord , Is the immediate jewel of their souls .
For both our sakes , I would that word were true .
Caesar is turned to hear .
Murder !
Here is more news .
He shall not live .
It is so .
Unwilling , I agreed .
Oh , then we bring forth weeds When our quick minds lie still , and our ills told us Is as our earing .
Why , is it not news to hear of Petruchio's coming ?
You men of Cyprus , let her have your knees .
Were 't twenty of the greatest tributaries That do acknowledge Caesar , should I find them So saucy with the hand of she here , what's her name Since she was Cleopatra ?
Why that's with watching , 'twill away again .
Mistress , that you know .
Gave it a judge's clerk !
The motions of his spirit are dull as night , And his affections dark as Erebus .
You ever gentle gods , take my breath from me .
Many hot inroads They make in Italy , the borders maritime Lack blood to think on 't , and flush youth revolt .
Where is he now ?
Your father was ever virtuous , and holy men at their death have good inspirations .
You cataracts and hurricanoes , spout Till you have drenched our steeples , drowned the cocks !
She that doth call me husband , even my soul Doth for a wife abhor .
Tis expressly against the law of arms .
The round world Should have shook lions into civil streets And citizens to their dens .
I know when one is dead and when one lives .
I am a fool To weep at what I am glad of .
Love is merely a madness and , I tell you , deserves as well a dark house and a whip as madmen do , and the reason why they are not so punished and cured is that the lunacy is so ordinary that the whippers are in love , too .
Farewell .
I shall not look upon his like again .
Such have but a shadow's bliss .
Be as ourself in Denmark. , Madam , come .
Speak , man .
Demand me nothing .
Come , blade , my breast imbrue .
How do you , women ?
Sir , March is wasted fifteen days .
Know'st thou the way to Dover ?
Who brought it ?
So haply are they friends to Antony .
And come you now with "knocking at the gate" ?
But nature should bring forth Of its own kind all foison , all abundance , To feed my innocent people .
That love i begged for you he begged of me .
If sight and shape be true , Why then , my love adieu .
There is a lord will hear you play tonight ; But I am doubtful of your modesties , Lest over-eyeing of his odd behavior , For yet his Honor never heard a play , You break into some merry passion And so offend him .
Why , no , sir .
Tell him we could have rebuked him at Harfleur , but that we thought not good to bruise an injury till it were full ripe .
I want more uncles here to welcome me .
God pardon them that are the cause thereof .
My fool usurps my body .
But here they come .
I do beseech your lordship , call her back .
I pray thee , good Horatio , wait upon him .
Fare you well .
Tom will throw his head at them. , Avaunt , you curs !
Up and down , up and down , I will lead them up and down .
It came even from the heart of , oh , she's dead !
Let me go .
Nature presently distilled Helen's cheek , but not her heart , Cleopatra's majesty , Atalanta's better part , Sad Lucretia's modesty .
This interchange of love , I here protest , Upon my part shall be inviolable .
We'll teach you to drink deep ere you depart .
Tis a worthy governor .
Antony Did tell me of you , bade me trust you , but I do not greatly care to be deceived , That have no use for trusting .
Help me , my women !
She was here even now .
I pray you , what is he ?
I can not think it .
I do repent me that I put it to you .
Hop in his walks and gambol in his eyes .
Fie on her !
I am fire and air , my other elements I give to baser life. , So , have you done ?
O Antony !
For Brutus ' sake , I am beholding to you .
If die , be brief , That our swift-winged souls may catch the king's , Or , like obedient subjects , follow him To his new kingdom of ne'er-changing night .
Hence , horrible shadow !
Vengeance , plague , death , confusion !
How say you , then ?
Prithee , be not angry .
Why , then you must .
For your desire to know what is between us , O'ermaster 't as you may .
The main descry Stands in the hourly thought .
And be not easily won to our requests .
O most dear mistress , The sun will set before I shall discharge What I must strive to do .
Which is the lady I must seize upon ?
He always loved our sister most , and with what poor judgment he hath now cast her off appears too grossly .
Silence awhile. , Robin , take off this head. , Titania , music call , and strike more dead Than common sleep of all these five the sense .
O cruel !
Let every eye nogetiate for itself And trust no agent , for beauty is a witch Against whose charms faith melteth into blood .
Adieu , good Queen .
I know thee well enough .
No , good mother .
I come to fetch you to the senate house .
I have made strong proof of my constancy , Giving myself a voluntary wound Here in the thigh .
Follow the noise so far as we have quarter ; Let's see how it will give off .
Is he alone ?
Look , with a spot I damn him .
Oh , ay .
There is a fat friend at your master's house That kitchened me for you today at dinner .
Thou dost , and think'st it much to tread the ooze Of the salt deep , To run upon the sharp wind of the north , To do me business in the veins o ' th ' earth When it is baked with frost .
Off , pluck off !
Therefore be out of hope , of question , of doubt .
And why not the swift foot of time ?
Twas full two years ere I could get a tooth .
Lives he ?
Adieu , good neighbor .
In my chamber window lies a book .
I do not , till you practice them on me .
Thou art too wild , too rude and bold of voice , Parts that become thee happily enough And in such eyes as ours appear not faults .
And for my name of George begins with It follows in his thought that I am he .
Knock , sir ?
Well , we shall see your bearing .
Shylock is my name .
God buy you , take mine office .
Go to , they are not men o ' their words .
The oars were silver , Which to the tune of flutes kept stroke , and made The water which they beat to follow faster , As amorous of their strokes .
But is there any else longs to see this broken music in his sides ?
Are you yet determined Today to marry with my brother's daughter ?
My decayed fair A sunny look of his would soon repair .
Wouldst thou betray me ?
Upon this hint I spake .
And when I have stol'n upon these sons-in-law , Then , kill , kill , kill , kill , kill , kill !
Tis true .
Well met , honest gentleman .
How many things by season seasoned are To their right praise and true perfection !
This is the very false gallop of verses .
I wonder that you will still be talking , Signor Benedick .
My other self , my council's consistory , My oracle , my prophet , my dear cousin , I , as a child , will go by thy direction Toward Ludlow then , for we'll not stay behind .
I will have nothing else but only this .
But had he such a chain of thee or no ?
What work is here , Charmian ?
Tis Cinna .
I am glad of it .
You scarcely have the hearts to tell me so , And therefore can not have the hearts to do it .
It is my birthday .
Where is thy master , Dromio ?
And that most deeply to consider is The beauty of his daughter .
Where have I been ?
Tis pitiful , but yet Iago knows That she with Cassio hath the act of shame A thousand times committed .
There is something else .
And yet my sky shall not want .
Indeed she's a most fresh and delicate creature .
The wine of life is drawn , and the mere lees Is left this vault to brag of .
Here at the door .
Coldhearted toward me ?
Dead ?
Hence !
Do you see this , O God ?
With anger , with sickness , or with hunger , my lord , not with love .
Ay , my lord .
Come from thy ward , For I can here disarm thee with this stick And make thy weapon drop .
We will greet the time .
Do you not jest ?
But I , who never knew how to entreat , Nor never needed that I should entreat , Am starved for meat , giddy for lack of sleep , With oaths kept waking and with brawling fed .
Is there division 'twixt my lord and Cassio ?
Armed , say you ?
Marry , beshrew my hand If it should give your age such cause of fear .
We are haunted .
Truly , sir , in respect of a fine workman , I am but , as you would say , a cobbler .
What , I say ?
Caesar and Lepidus have made wars upon Pompey .
Thyself shalt see the act .
I like him not , nor stands it safe with us To let his madness range .
Win me and wear me !
Nay , you must call me Rosalind. , Come , sister , will you go ?
Right true it is your son Lucentio here Doth love my daughter and she loveth him , Or both dissemble deeply their affections .
As sure , my liege , as I do see your Grace .
Bring me just notice of the numbers dead On both our parts .
By Jupiter , I swear "No." By Juno , I swear "Ay." They durst not do 't .
My mistress , sir , " quoth I .
Leonato and his brother .
How now , old lad ?
Therefore you must needs play Pyramus .
Say it , Othello .
My news shall be the fruit to that great feast .
O , if thou wert the noblest of thy strain , Young man , thou couldst not die more honorable .
She sent for you by Dromio home to dinner .
I would have such a fellow whipped for o'erdoing Termagant .
If not , shun me , and I will spare your haunts .

He is as disproportioned in his manners As in his shape. , Take with you your companions .
Tis true , my lords , he did .
He hath every month a new sworn brother .
What's the disease he means ?
She's an excellent sweet lady , and , out of all suspicion , she is virtuous .
This is my treasurer .
Give him this deed , And let him sign it .
Why , fare thee well .
Lay breath so bitter on your bitter foe .
He can not live , I hope , and must not die Till George be packed with post-horse up to heaven .
How beauteous mankind is !
Come , you are too severe a moraler .
If justice can not tame you , she shall ne'er weigh more reasons in her balance .
Albeit you have deserved High commendation , true applause , and love , Yet such is now the duke's condition That he misconsters all that you have done .
No offense i ' th ' world .
This is the fruits of rashness .
How say you , Cassio ?
What is your will , sir , that you send for me ?
Sir , I say to you it is thought you are false knaves .
Many times , madam .
First , madam , he is well .
Give me your hand .
O , cleave , my sides !
The clerk is answered .
If I stand here , I saw him .
We shall , my lord .
Go you with me , uncle of Exeter .
No , let me know , And knowing what I am , I know what she shall be .
For so thou art .
I could well forbear 't .
Would they were basilisks to strike thee dead .
Both which , Master Constable , You have .
Did he take interest ?
I have a good eye , uncle .
A match !
Does any here know me ?
What thou wouldst do Is done unto thy hand .
I do but beg a little changeling boy , To be my henchman .
I will not stay tonight for all the town .
I'll sell all my land .
And make him with fair aegles break his faith , With Ariadne and Antiopa ?
Tarry , rash wanton .
Come now , your promise .
I doubt not but his friends will turn to us .
I'll be thy second .
How now , Oswald ?
Four nights will quickly dream away the time .
Welcome hither .
Good Volumnius , Thou know'st that we two went to school together .
Oh , villainy , villainy !
It looks a little paler .
Fortune pursue thee !
We doubt it nothing .
Thou must know , 'Tis not my profit that does lead mine honor ; Mine honor , it .
I shall attend you presently at your tent .
These ears of mine , thou know'st did hear thee .
Will you withdraw ?
Who shall bar me from them ?
Never , my lord .
What mean you , madam ?
The gods reward your kindness !
I will not trouble thee , my child .
As mine eyes opened , I saw their weapons drawn .
No harm .
Now , by my mother's son , and that's myself , It shall be moon , or star , or what I list , Or e'er I journey to your father's house .
Amen .
The queen carouses to thy fortune , Hamlet .
Intend a kind of zeal both to the Prince and Claudio , as in love of your brother's honor , who hath made this match , and his friend's reputation , who is thus like to be cozened with the semblance of a maid , that you have discovered thus .
Cessez !
Commend me to my kind lord .
Will your grace command me any service to the world's end ?
The Prince's fool !
Welcome , dear Rosencrantz and Guildenstern .
O Pomfret , Pomfret !
A turn or two I'll walk To still my beating mind .
Say this becomes him , As his composure must be rare indeed Whom these things can not blemish , yet must Antony No way excuse his foils when we do bear So great weight in his lightness .
Why , what did I ?
I am a villain .
Master , here's The gold you sent me for .
Let her witness it .
Brown , madam , and her forehead As low as she would wish it .
Not I , I must be found .
Not a whit .
Myself the man i ' th ' moon do seem to be , This is the greatest error of all the rest .
Therefore with frank and with uncurbed plainness Tell us the Dauphin's mind .
Both sides are even .
Scratch my head , Peaseblossom .
Is it not like the king ?
No , for I hold him to be unworthy of his place that does those things .
He goes before me and still dares me on .
An if I be , sir , is it any offense ?
Most gracious Duke , To my unfolding lend your prosperous ear And let me find a charter in your voice , T ' assist my simpleness .
When I desire their leave that I might pity him , they took from me the use of mine own house , charged me on pain of their perpetual displeasure neither to speak of him , entreat for him , nor any way sustain him .
Why then , lead on .
Farewell , kind lord .
You have told me she hath received them and returned me expectations and comforts of sudden respect and acquaintance , but I find none .
What , are you mad that you do reason so ?
Let us sit and mock the good housewife Fortune from her wheel , that her gifts may henceforth be bestowed equally .
Hear the noble Antony .
O my dear Orlando , how it grieves me to see thee wear thy heart in a scarf .
I could make as true a boast as that if I had a sow to my mistress .
Ay , but the clerk that never means to do it Unless he live until he be a man .
There's strange news come , sir .
Press near and second him .
I will weary you then no longer with idle talking .
She is not , madam .
Plots have I laid , inductions dangerous , By drunken prophecies , libels and dreams , To set my brother Clarence and the king In deadly hate , the one against the other ; And if King Edward be as true and just As I am subtle , false , and treacherous , This day should Clarence closely be mewed up About a prophecy which says that "G" Of Edward's heirs the murderer shall be .
Hark , hark !
I need not to be ashamed of your Majesty , praised be God , so long as your Majesty is an honest man .
Speak thou now .
You must note beside , That we have tried the utmost of our friends , Our legions are brim-full , our cause is ripe .
O , how we joy to see your wit restored !
Never king of England Had nobles richer , and more loyal subjects , Whose hearts have left their bodies here in England And lie pavilioned in the fields of France .
How , how I pray you ?
The even mead , that erst brought sweetly forth The freckled cowslip , burnet , and green clover , Wanting the scythe , withal uncorrected , rank , Conceives by idleness , and nothing teems But hateful docks , rough thistles , kecksies , burrs , Losing both beauty and utility .
My lord , for aught I know .
Here comes the herald of the French , my liege .
When he returns from hunting , I will not speak with him .
Baptista is a noble gentleman , To whom my father is not all unknown , And were his daughter fairer than she is , She may more suitors have , and me for one .
Marcus Luccicos , is not he in town ?
Make no noise , make no noise .
Well , I know not What counts harsh Fortune casts upon my face , But in my bosom shall she never come To make my heart her vassal .
We love him highly And shall continue our graces towards him .
I will not rise unless your Highness hear me .
Sir , the gods Will have it thus .
Judgment ?
O , let her live , And I'll corrupt her manners , stain her beauty , Slander myself as false to Edward's bed , Throw over her the veil of infamy .
First , good Peter Quince , say what the play treats on , then read the names of the actors , and so grow to a point .
Alas , why gnaw you so your nether lip ?
The wall , methinks , being sensible , should curse again .
I was enforced to send it after him .
Come , help to bear thy master .
His majesty , Tend'ring my person's safety , hath appointed This conduct to convey me to the Tower .
Do not you chide .
Caesar , I never stood on ceremonies , Yet now they fright me .
Tut , I like it not .
Thou naughty knave , what trade ?
Come , thou tortoise !
I am not in a sportive humor now .
Not possible .
I prithee , boy , run to the senate house .
It is hypocrisy against the devil .
To cry "Amen" to that , thus we appear .
His flight was madness .
I am mightily abused .
Most noble brother , you have done me wrong .
The cockerel .
Think on me , That am with Phoebus' amorous pinches black And wrinkled deep in time .
Good faith , a little one , not past a pint , As I am a soldier .
Much castigation , exercise devout , For here's a young and sweating devil here , That commonly rebels .
Please you , farther .
And yet to win her , all the world to nothing !
Enough , I am engaged .
March to the bridge .
Enough , Captain .
Why art thou here , Come from the farthest step of India ?
Wherein hath Caesar thus deserved your loves ?
Stand from the body .
O valiant cousin !
Farewell , and if my fortune be not crost , I have a father , you a daughter , lost .
I never was nor never will be false .
She loved me for the dangers I had passed , And I loved her that she did pity them .
Just as high as my heart .
I must attend the duke at dinner .
Are these , I pray you , wind instruments ?
Well , peace be with you .
My lord , there needs no such apology .
Madam , with all my heart .
Proof enough to misuse the Prince , to vex Claudio , to undo Hero , and kill Leonato .
Signor Antonio Commends him to you .
Went he hence now ?
Could not this make thee know The hate I bear thee made me leave thee so ?
Tis yours , and we , Your scutcheons and your signs of conquest , shall Hang in what place you please .
Ay , ay .
I hear the minstrels play .
Thou hast my love .
What , Lucius !
And to run away from the Jew I should be ruled by the fiend , who , saving your reverence , is the devil himself .
My Lord Bassanio gave his ring away Unto the judge that begged it and indeed Deserved it too .
Is 't not Hortensio ?
Maybe he is not well .
Do not you hear a cry ?
Why , why is this ?
Saw you the weird sisters ?
I humbly take my leave .
Invoke his warlike spirit And your great-uncle's , Edward the Black Prince , Who on the French ground played a tragedy , Making defeat on the full power of France Whiles his most mighty father on a hill Stood smiling to behold his lion's whelp Forage in blood of French nobility .
Some other time .
Marry , th ' athversary was have possession of the pridge , but he is enforced to retire , and the duke of Exeter is master of the pridge .
Through the sharp hawthorn blows the cold wind .
O Jupiter , how weary are my spirits !
Do this expediently , and turn him going .
Well , you are a rare parrot-teacher .

Will you go ?
I dare be sworn for him he would not leave it Nor pluck it from his finger for the wealth That the world masters .

To none but thee , no more but when to thee .
But I will punish home .

My most dear lord !
Dido and her Aeneas shall want troops , And all the haunt be ours. , Come , Eros , Eros !
O gentle lady , 'T is not for you to hear what I can speak : The repetition , in a woman's ear , Would murder as it fell .

Grandam , one night as we did sit at supper , My uncle Rivers talked how I did grow More than my brother : "Ay , " quoth my uncle Gloucester , "Small herbs have grace ; great weeds do grow apace." And since , methinks I would not grow so fast Because sweet flowers are slow and weeds make haste .

I pray you all , stand up .
Here's to thy health .

My father charged you in his will to give me good education .
Wouldst thou aught with me ?
If so , my eyes are oftener washed than hers .
Fortune now To my heart's hope !
Do you speak in the sick tune ?
There's few or none will entertain it .
He lays it on .
If you will watch his going thence ( which I will fashion to fall out between twelve and one ) you may take him at your pleasure .
Let me go , sir , or I'll knock you o'er the mazzard .
Almost at odds with morning , which is which .
Oh , you are men of stones .
O , had the gods done so , I had not now Worthily termed them merciless to us .

Faith , I saw it not , but I felt it hot in her breath .
Canst thou remember A time before we came unto this cell ?
Knock you here , sir ?

I knew what you would prove .
I would thou couldst .
They see and smell And have their palates both for sweet and sour , As husbands have .
Tyrants themselves wept when it was reported .
After a little time , I'll beat him too .
Take him hence .
How goes it here ?
I'll put 't in proof .
False , false .
Where do I dwell ?
See where his Grace stands , 'tween two clergymen .
It is a common thing , Ha ?
You do assist the storm .
By my troth , a good song .

I hope so , Lepidus .
I prithee let me have it .
Hie thee , gentle Jew .
Modo he's called , and Mahu .

Nothing extenuate , Nor set down aught in malice .
Remember thee !
The better that your Lordship please to ask .
Witless else her son .
No , but to the gate , and there will the devil meet me like an old cuckold with horns on his head , and say , "Get you to heaven , Beatrice , get you to heaven ; here's no place for you maids." So deliver I up my apes and away to Saint Peter .

But down .
It shall to the barber's , with your beard. , Prithee , say on .
We are in God's hand , brother , not in theirs .
Here comes Brabantio and the valiant Moor .
It harrows me with fear and wonder .
The Jew shall have my flesh , blood , bones and all , Ere thou shalt lose for me one drop of blood .
We please them not by land .
It were an honest action to say So to the Moor .
Ev'n as your horse bears your praises , who would trot as well were some of your brags dismounted .
But is there no sequel at the heels of this mother's admiration ?
When he came to himself again , he said , if he had done or said anything amiss , he desired their worships to think it was his infirmity .
Be kind and courteous to this gentleman .
What , you look merrily .
I would I could see this taborer .
That's a question .
For Brutus , as you know , was Caesar's angel .
Hold off your hands .
And wherefore are you gentle , strong , and valiant ?
Their defeat Does by their own insinuation grow .
Wherefore's this noise ?
What is a man If his chief good and market of his time Be but to sleep and feed ?
All hail , Macbeth !
Thou never shalt hear herald anymore .
Adieu .
Yes , he is dead .
Alack , alack !
We see how mortal an unkindness is to them .
Let me shun that .
The nature of bad news infects the teller .
Therefore prepare thyself .
Believe none of us .
By any other house or person ?
Good dawning to thee , friend .
Oh , ten times faster Venus ' pigeons fly To seal love's bonds new made than they are wont To keep obliged faith unforfeited .
At mine own house , good lady .
You speak to Casca , and to such a man That is no fleering telltale .
Twill not be seen in him there .
Help , Charmian , help , Iras , help !
Why , in good time .
He only in a general honest thought And common good to all , made one of them .
If it will not be , I'll leave you .
I have as much of my father in me as you , albeit , I confess , your coming before me is nearer to his reverence .
My mistress showed me thee and thy dog and thy bush .
And I in all unwillingness will go .
Fair daylight ?
If that thou be'st a devil , I can not kill thee .
If her breath were as terrible as her terminations , there were no living near her ; she would infect to the north star .
And this , Metellus Cimber .
I say I love thee more than he can do .
And what noise is this ?
Royal Egypt , Empress !
Woe to the hand that shed this costly blood !
And for the rest o ' th ' fleet , Which I dispersed , they all have met again And are upon the Mediterranean float , Bound sadly home for Naples , Supposing that they saw the king's ship wracked And his great person perish .
My name is Roderigo .
Fairly spoke .
By no means , sir .
The wife of Antony Should have an army for an usher and The neighs of horse to tell of her approach Long ere she did appear .
Twas the boy that stole your meat , and you'll beat the post .
Indeed , sweet love , I was coming to your house .
Here comes the lady .
I know the man .
Let 'em enter .
O , then I see you will part but with light gifts .
Truly , I have him , but I would not be the party that should desire you to touch him , for his biting is immortal .
Mechanic slaves With greasy aprons , rules , and hammers shall Uplift us to the view .
Only in the world I fill up a place which may be better supplied when I have made it empty .
Wilt thou show the whole wealth of thy wit in an instant ?
You are welcome , masters , welcome , all ! , I am glad to see thee well. , Welcome , good friends. , O old friend ?
What , is he angry ?
Sitting on a bank , Weeping again the king my father's wrack , This music crept by me upon the waters , Allaying both their fury and my passion With its sweet air .
These foolish drops do something drown my manly spirit .
Alack , my lord , what do you mean by that ?
Very well .
Go you before , and I will follow you .
Is your name Goneril ?
Where did you leave him ?
Tis but a peevish boy , yet he talks well , But what care I for words ?
We'll hear him what he says .
O , serve me well , and teach yourselves that duty !
Farewell the plumed troops and the big wars That makes ambition virtue !
Women's gentle brain Could not drop forth such giant-rude invention , Such Ethiop words , blacker in their effect Than in their countenance .
My more particular , And that which most with you should safe my going , Is Fulvia's death .
Let me entreat you .
Pray , have you not a daughter Called Katherina , fair and virtuous ?
You can not , sir , take from me any thing that I will more willingly part withal , except my life , except my life , except my life .
What two crowns shall they be ?
I am your wife if you will marry me .
To prayers , to prayers , all lost !
Lord Hamlet , Heaven secure him !
My brother killed no man ; his fault was thought , And yet his punishment was bitter death .
O , how this mother swells up toward my heart !
Tis bootless to exclaim .
Nay , forward , old man .
Signior Baptista , will you be so strange ?
But tell not me .
Thou look'st cheerly , and I'll be with thee quickly .
Yet am I noble as the adversary I come to cope withal .
A very gentle beast , of a good conscience .
Yet I persuade myself to speak the truth Shall nothing wrong him .
Have you not set Lysander , as in scorn , To follow me and praise my eyes and face ?
Thou troublest me ; I am not in the vein .
It was in place where I could not breed no contention with him , but I will be so bold as to wear it in my cap till I see him once again , and then I will tell him a little piece of my desires .
To this , add defiance , and tell him , for conclusion , he hath betrayed his followers , whose condemnation is pronounced." So far my king and master ; so much my office .
Ay , mistress , and Petruchio is the master , That teacheth tricks eleven and twenty long To tame a shrew and charm her chattering tongue .
Oh , let their bodies follow , my dear liege , With blood and sword and fire to win your right , In aid whereof we of the spiritualty Will raise your Highness such a mighty sum As never did the clergy at one time Bring in to any of your ancestors .
Lead me from hence .
To go out of my dialect , which you discommend so much .
I wish him joy of her .
If he fail of that , He will have other means to cut you off .
She shall be buried with her face upwards .
Which is that adversary ?
Why should the poor be flattered ?
The iron tongue of midnight hath told twelve .
Out , tawny Tartar , out !
We have willing dames enough .
That chain will I bestow , Be it for nothing but to spite my wife , Upon mine hostess there .
Let housewifery appear .
I am Launcelot , your boy that was , your son that is , your child that shall be .
Come , come , You'll never meet a more sufficient man .
My babes were destined to a fairer death If grace had blessed thee with a fairer life .
Why then , thus it is : You must prepare your bosom for his knife .
And from henceforth When you are over-earnest with your Brutus , He'll think your mother chides and leave you so .
Yea , Signior , and depart when you bid me .
Art thou wise ?
We must do something , and i ' th ' heat .
The word is too good to paint out her wickedness .
Is that true ?
When were you wont to be so full of songs , sirrah ?
Pray you , leave your courtesy , good monsieur .
He , of all the men that ever my foolish eyes looked upon , was the best deserving a fair lady .
Are my deserts no better ?
I never did deny it .
How now , sirrah !
No , he doth but mistake the truth totally .
Go to him , madam , speak to him .
Twenty crowns ?
Adieu .
I will be heard .
The transgression is in the stealer .
I denied you not .
Turn thee back , And tell thy king I do not seek him now But could be willing to march on to Calais Without impeachment , for , to say the sooth , Though 'tis no wisdom to confess so much Unto an enemy of craft and vantage , My people are with sickness much enfeebled , My numbers lessened , and those few I have Almost no better than so many French , Who when they were in health , I tell thee , herald , I thought upon one pair of English legs Did march three Frenchmen .
So it should be , that none but Antony Should conquer Antony , but woe 'tis so !
Ay , and wisely .
May I with right and conscience make this claim ?
I will debate this matter at more leisure And teach your ears to list me with more heed .
Why , the night gone by .
For I am sure mine nails Are stronger than mine eyes .
Had he done so ?
But , were you wedded , you would bear some sway .
Farewell .
But this rough magic I here abjure , and when I have required Some heavenly music , which even now I do , To work mine end upon their senses that This airy charm is for , I'll break my staff , Bury it certain fathoms in the earth , And deeper than did ever plummet sound I'll drown my book .
My father loved Sir Rowland as his soul , And all the world was of my father's mind .
Nay , hear him .
Happy indeed , as we have spent the day .
Hamlet." This in obedience hath my daughter shown me , And more above , hath his solicitings , As they fell out by time , by means , and place , All given to mine ear .
Neither can be enjoyed If both remain alive .
Oh , God defend me !
Madam , it so fell out , that certain players We o'erraught on the way .
Far more , far more , to you do I decline .
I heard thee say even now thou lik'st not that When Cassio left my wife .
Come , uncle Exeter , Go you and enter Harfleur .
We have done our course .
He says his name is Master Fer .
Sir , do you know me ?
The messenger Came on my guard , and at thy tent is now Unloading of his mules .
It is a pretty youth , not very pretty , But sure he's proud , and yet his pride becomes him .
Do , if it will not stand .
Look , where she comes .
Look like th ' innocent flower , But be the serpent under 't .
Call him .
Katherine his daughter and with her , to dowry , Some petty and unprofitable dukedoms .
Alas , he is too young .
Being so frustrate , tell him , he mocks The pauses that he makes .
And he's gone .
He that commends me to mine own content Commends me to the thing I can not get .
Upon the platform , 'twixt eleven and twelve , I'll visit you .
Revenge his foul and most unnatural murder .
Dishonor not your mothers .
Come down , behold no more .
Ay , on the front .
Sure it is hers .
If thou would have such a one , take me .
Yes , just .
Bemonster not thy feature .
To his father , that so tenderly and entirely loves him .
Ha !
Men must not walk too late .
You have done well , That men must lay their murders on your neck .
I am right loath to go .
Pray , sir , be patient .
I would not be the villain that thou think'st For the whole space that's in the tyrant's grasp , And the rich East to boot .
And you all know , security Is mortals ' chiefest enemy .
You are early stirring .
Hear my excuse .
Come , let's away .
Come , come , let us thither .
My lord shall never rest , I'll watch him tame and talk him out of patience .
Now your jest is earnest .
I'll tell thee how Beatrice praised thy wit he other day .
Helen , it is not so .
Now , Cinna. , Now , Metellus. , What , Trebonius , I have an hour's talk in store for you .
We must obey the time .
His speech was like a tangled chain .
How now ?
Welcome , lady .
I know her answer .
Ay , and Wall too .
We'll go to supper i ' th ' morning .
How many times shall Caesar bleed in sport , That now on Pompey's basis lies along No worthier than the dust !
And , sir , tonight I do entreat that we may sup together .
Hush , Thou think'st there is no more such shapes as he , Having seen but him and Caliban .
Your mistress sent to have me home to dinner ?
You must not look so sour .
Strike alarum , drums !
Beat me ?
I have a wife , whom I protest I love .
Nay , 'tis twice two months , my lord .
Kill Brutus , and be honored in his death .
Heaven and earth !
With bills on their necks : "Be it known unto all men by these presents." The eldest of the three wrestled with Charles , the duke's wrestler , which Charles in a moment threw him and broke three of his ribs , that there is little hope of life in him .
And shall I couple hell ?
At this hour Lie at my mercy all mine enemies .
No , not a whit .
Who can impress the forest , bid the tree Unfix his earthbound root ?
I am sorry that I am deceived in him .
Oh , he is gone indeed .
Iago beckons me .
What mean you , sir ?
Ay , and twenty such .
Twill be heavier soon by the weight of a man .
Doing is activity , and he will still be doing .
We'll so begin these rites As we do trust they'll end , in true delights .
They are so still , Or thou , the greatest soldier of the world , Art turned the greatest liar .
That's my sister .
Let's ha 't , good soldier .
In cash , most justly paid .
What sights , my lord ?
Go , get thee gone , I say .
Kind gentlemen , let's go see poor Cassio dressed. , Come , mistress , you must tell 's another tale .
If you swear , my lord , you shall not be forsworn .
Antonio .
Myself and what is mine to you and yours Is now converted .
If he do resist , Subdue him at his peril !
Why , now , as fast as she can marry us .
Where have you hid yourself ?
Well pray you , father .
What is your will ?
Then walk we forth , even to the marketplace , And waving our red weapons o'er our heads Let's all cry , "Peace , freedom , and liberty ! " Stoop , then , and wash .
Tooth that poisons if it bite , Mastiff , greyhound , mongrel grim ,
And I as I love Hastings with my heart .
Where are his eyes ?
For indeed , who would set his wit to so foolish a bird ?
Was this before the king returned ?
Where souls do couch on flowers , we'll hand in hand , And with our sprightly port make the ghosts gaze .
What sayst thou to me now ?
Alas , poor shepherd , searching of thy wound , I have by hard adventure found mine own .
What , wilt thou hear some music , my sweet love ?
If with myself I hold intelligence Or have acquaintance with mine own desires , If that I do not dream or be not frantic , As I do trust I am not , then , dear uncle , Never so much as in a thought unborn Did I offend your Highness .
Cast on no water .
Why is your cheek so pale ?
Since thou dost give me pains , Let me remember thee what thou hast promised , Which is not yet performed me .
It is a poison tempered by himself .
I say , O Caesar , Antony is dead .
I will lay trust upon thee , and thou shalt find a dearer father in my love .
Saint Davy's day is past .
Call my sister so .
And thus it may be .
Knock at the gate ?
And so I am , I am .
What should I stay , In this wild world ?
We'll be friends first .
She gave it him , and he hath given it his whore .
Tomorrow is the day .
Travelers ne'er did lie , Though fools at home condemn 'em .
You do remember all the circumstance ?
Two things are to be done : My wife must move for Cassio to her mistress .
But you , O you , So perfect and so peerless , are created Of every creature's best .
Nay , press not so upon me .
What , thou ?
You can not feed capons so .
If thou wilt lend this money , lend it not As to thy friends , for when did friendship take A breed for barren metal of his friend ?
Hath any man seen him at the barber's ?
Was ever match clapped up so suddenly ?
But are you sure That Benedick loves Beatrice so entirely ?
Let not the royal bed of Denmark be A couch for luxury and damned incest .
My liege , this was my glove ; here is the fellow of it .
Patience , gentle Audrey .
For my uncle is King of Denmark , and those that would make mouths at him while my father lived give twenty , forty , fifty , a hundred ducats apiece for his picture in little .
Fourscore ducats !
Thou seest these lovers seek a place to fight .
Dark night , that from the eye his function takes , The ear more quick of apprehension makes .
Make a short shrift .
There's more depends on this than on the value .
What would you , Desdemona ?
They are all welcome .
Nothing is good , I see , without respect .
I dare swear he is no hypocrite but prays from his heart .
I am transformed , master , am I not ?
What's the matter ?
Do you misdoubt This sword and these my wounds ?
Very good .
Our sex , as well as I , may chide you for it , Though I alone do feel the injury .
A very forward March-chick !
What means your lordship ?
We would be resolved , Before we hear him , of some things of weight That task our thoughts concerning us and France .
I'll serve you , sir , five hundred at the rate .
Mine , and most of our fortunes tonight , shall be , drunk to bed .
For what advancement may I hope from thee That no revenue hast but thy good spirits , To feed and clothe thee ?
So God sa ' me , 'tis shame to stand still .
Not yet quite dead ?
Do you know them ?
A strange fish !
Thou art not by mine eye , Lysander , found .
In faith , lady , you have a merry heart .
Believe what ?
I think it was to see my mother's wedding .
Then say at once what is it thou requests .
Ay , but not frighted me .
All offices are open , and there is full liberty of feasting from this present hour of five till the bell have told eleven .
Sweet Desdemona !
Let us leave him .
He might have chid me so , for , in good faith , I am a child to chiding .
I shall do't , my lord .
Something from Cyprus as I may divine .
Why , 'tis a cockle or a walnut shell , A knack , a toy , a trick , a baby's cap .
Who is 't that cried ?
They were traitors !
Virtue is no hornmaker , and my Rosalind is virtuous .
Ay , marry , are they , sir .
Not this , but troubles of the marriage bed .
Bind him , I say .
An old Italian fox is not so kind , my boy .
And as our vineyards , fallows , meads , and hedges , Defective in their natures , grow to wildness , Even so our houses and ourselves and children Have lost , or do not learn for want of time , The sciences that should become our country , But grow like savages , as soldiers will
And yet , to say the truth , reason and love keep little company together nowadays .
You are , and do not know 't .
The ears are senseless that should give us hearing , To tell him his commandment is fulfilled , That Rosencrantz and Guildenstern are dead .
Therefore , queen of all , Katherine , break thy mind to me in broken English .
What's here ?
Duke Frederick , hearing how that every day Men of great worth resorted to this forest , Addressed a mighty power , which were on foot In his own conduct , purposely to take His brother here and put him to the sword .
Why , I pray you ?
Oh , the heavens !
Wherefore was that cry ?
Very well .
Casca will tell us what the matter is .
Now , if you love me , stay .
If every one knows us , and we know none , 'T is time , I think , to trudge , pack , and be gone .
On him I lay what you would lay on me , The right and fortune of his happy stars , Which God defend that I should wring from him .
Go to .
He is .
Cousins , you know what you have to do. , O , I cry you mercy , friend .
Is thy master stirring ?
But since the affairs of men rest still incertain , Let's reason with the worst that may befall .
Come on , assay .
More to know Did never meddle with my thoughts .
Sit .
Thou protector of this damned strumpet , Talk'st thou to me of "ifs" ?
Fare you well , sir .
What man is that ?
Ay , my lord .
What , frighted with false fire ?
Where's Antony ?
O hell , what have we here ?
She has robbed me of my sword .
Leave , gentle wax , and , manners , blame us not .
I grant I am a woman , but withal A woman that Lord Brutus took to wife .
Wouldst thou do such a deed for all the world ?
Ay , marry , now unmuzzle your wisdom .
Well , what is it ?
Will you lead , lords ?
Yea , an 'twere a thousand pound more than 'tis , for I hear as good exclamation on your Worship as of any man in the city , and though I be but a poor man , I am glad to hear it .
Oh , relation Too nice and yet too true !
O sweet Portia , Here are a few of the unpleasant'st words That ever blotted paper .
You shall not in your funeral speech blame us , But speak all good you can devise of Caesar , And say you do 't by our permission .
I thank thee , master .
Then like a Roman bear the truth I tell .
Come , come , we fear the worst .
I am sorry to hear this .
Here comes young Master Ganymede , my new mistress's brother .
He came to me , and I delivered it .
Will 't please your highness walk ?
Come one more .
No , my lord .
Why do you make such faces ?
But come , I'll tell thee all my whole device When I am in my coach , which stays for us At the park gate .
Why the King of France is so suddenly gone back know you the reason ?
One ?
Titinius , if thou lovest me , Mount thou my horse , and hide thy spurs in him Till he have brought thee up to yonder troops And here again , that I may rest assured Whether yond troops are friend or enemy .
Well , if you were but an inch of fortune better than I , where would you choose it ?
What news abroad ?
I hear none , madam .
But doth he know that I am in this forest and in man's apparel ?
I can not speak Any beginning to this peevish odds , And would in action glorious I had lost Those legs that brought me to a part of it .
Now , by my sword , And target .
I with the morning's love have oft made sport , And like a forester the groves may tread Even till the eastern gate , all fiery red , Opening on Neptune with fair blessed beams , Turns into yellow gold his salt green streams .
I have Immortal longings in me .
Our care and pity is so much upon you That we remain your friend .
King Lear hath lost , he and his daughter ta'en .
Edmund I think is gone In pity of his misery to dispatch His nighted life ; moreover to descry The strength o ' th ' enemy .
O my lord !
Fool , of thyself speak well .
You forget yourself To hedge me in .
It then draws near the season Wherein the spirit held his wont to walk .
Good words are better than bad strokes , Octavius .
Let's mock the midnight bell .
No , not tonight .
Who comes so fast in silence of the night ?
I pray thee , Rosalind , sweet my coz , be merry .
Treason and murder ever kept together As two yoke-devils sworn to either's purpose , Working so grossly in a natural cause That admiration did not whoop at them .
Farewell .
I'll do the service of a younger man In all your business and necessities .
What thou seest when thou dost wake , Do it for thy true love take .
No doubt but he hath got a quiet catch .
If Caesar had stabbed their mothers they would have done no less .
A holy day shall this be kept hereafter .
What a brazen-faced varlet art thou to deny thou knowest me !
Our friends all stay for you .
Who's there ?
I have much to do But to go hang my head all at one side And sing it like poor Barbary .
His beard was grizzled , no ?
Ah ha !
My father's bears more toward the marketplace .
Is it they ?
Thou art come to answer A stony adversary , an inhuman wretch Uncapable of pity , void and empty From any dram of mercy .
Hath she made her affection known to Benedick ?
Hath Leonato any son , my lord ?
What , would you make me mad ?
Nay , come , I pray you , sir , give me the chain .
The day is spent .
She thanked me And bade me , if I had a friend that loved her , I should but teach him how to tell my story And that would woo her .
The King will be gone from Southampton .
What to him from England ?
This night I'll spend Unto a dismal and a fatal end .
Even for that I thank you .
They would not have you to stir forth today .
Good night .
Well , time is the old justice that examines all such offenders , and let time try .
When that's gone , He shall drink naught but brine , for I'll not show him Where the quick freshes are .
Call him in .
See , they encounter thee with their hearts ' thanks .
Yet bend not all the harm upon yourself .
Show me , show me .
Farewell .
What , Octavia ?
Fetch me an iron crow .
Be it so .
Thou worms ' meat in respect of a good piece of flesh , indeed .
My lord , my lord , I will not hear you .
Officers , what offense have these men done ?
My Lord , Ay , what's o'clock ?
Twas where you wooed the gentlewoman so well .
Command him away .
Her husband , knave .
Corinth first .
Antony only , that would make his will Lord of his reason .
What is Pyramus ?
Ride , ride , Messala .
They do me wrong , and I will not endure it !
Leave me , I pray , a little .
And that same vengeance doth He hurl on thee For false forswearing and for murder too .
He's married to Octavia .
Had I a glass , I would .
And so doth mine .
The four strangers seek for you , madam , to take their leave .
Tis best to give him way .
What shall I do ?
The morning comes upon 's .
Let us now stay and see it .
I had rather hear my dog bark at a crow than a man swear he loves me .
My husband , then ?
You sent me to the bay , sir , for a bark .
Come ho , and wake Diana with a hymn !
Oh , treble woe Fall ten times treble on that cursed head , Whose wicked deed thy most ingenious sense Deprived thee of !
And that which spites me more than all these wants , He does it under name of perfect love , As who should say , if I should sleep or eat , 'Twere deadly sickness or else present death .
You know not Whether it was his wisdom or his fear .
Come , the recorders !
The gods defend her ! , hear him hence awhile .
I am dying , Egypt , dying .
Tis but a little way that I can bring you , For I attend here .
After so long grief , such nativity !
What offense , sweet Beatrice ?
You do me wrong to take me out o ' th ' grave .
I am sure you know him well enough .
What didst not like ?
Had he a hand to write this , a heart and brain to breed it in ?
Wherefore did they not That hour destroy us ?
My niece Plantagenet Led in the hand of her kind aunt of Gloucester ?
If they have done this deed , my noble lord , If ?
I put it in the pocket of my gown .
Then in my tent , Cassius , enlarge your griefs , And I will give you audience .
Sir , a word ere you go .
Is he come ?
That will I .
Let life be short , else shame will be too long .
I am old and foolish .
If I say sooth , I must report they were As cannons overcharged with double cracks , So they doubly redoubled strokes upon the foe .
It is the lady that Pyramus must love .
Let him come in .
Is Decius Brutus and Trebonius there ?
Let him command , And to obey shall be in me remorse , What bloody business ever .
How do you , pretty lady ?
Is thy union here ?
Fair Beatrice , I thank you for your pains .
The hearts of old gave hands , But our new heraldry is hands , not hearts .
Approach , my Ariel , come .
How shall we beguile The lazy time if not with some delight ?
There's hell , there's darkness , there's the sulfurous pit , burning , scalding , stench , consumption !
The Moor already changes with my poison .
Oh , thou art wise !
I'll write to him a very taunting letter , And thou shalt bear it .
Boy !
Our queen and all our elves come here anon .
Receive what cheer you may .
Now might I do it pat .
If it might please you to enforce no further The griefs between ye , to forget them quite Were to remember that the present need Speaks to atone you .
To the breach , to the breach !
There is more in it. , Cousin Ganymede .
If we grow all to be pork-eaters , we shall not shortly have a rasher on the coals for money .
Fare-well .
Thou know'st we work by wit and not by witchcraft , And wit depends on dilatory time .
I pray you , rise .
You were to blame , I must be plain with you , To part so slightly with your wife's first gift , A thing stuck on with oaths upon your finger And so riveted with faith unto your flesh .
Thy mother's name is ominous to children .
More than pertains to feats of broils and battle , And therefore little shall I grace my cause In speaking for myself .
I never gave him any .
Cold friends to me .
The more I hate , the more he follows me .
Though our lives , Your spirits shine through you .
Legged like a man and his fins like arms !
Fury , Fury ! , There , Tyrant , there .
Pisa , renowned for grave citizens , Gave me my being and my father first , A merchant of great traffic through the world , Vincentio , come of the Bentivolii .
I ' faith , i ' faith , and both in a tune like two gypsies on a horse .
He is justly served .
Do not run away .
Avoid , and leave him .
Come , temperate nymphs , and help to celebrate A contract of true love .
Tis Banquo's then .
Tell me , good Brutus , can you see your face ?
Are you yet living ?
I pray you , have a continent forbearance till the speed of his rage goes slower .
Where be these bloody thieves ?
I hold you but a subject of this war , Not as a brother .
We'll hear him. , Noble Antony , go up .
Soon at five o'clock , Please you , I'll meet with you upon the mart And afterward consort you till bedtime .
I rather will subject me to the malice Of a diverted blood and bloody brother .
What is 't , Ophelia , he hath said to you ?
We are very sorry for't .
Tis nine o'clock .
O , unpleasing news !
When it concerns the fool or coward .
I'm out of patience .
He did bespeak a chain for me but had it not .
I bleed , sir , but not killed .
That is the chain , sir , which you had of me .
When it is paid according to the tenor .
He brings great news .
Marry , sir , in her buttocks .
Hold you content .
But let it rest. , Now , Litio , to you .
You will lose this wager , my lord .
He is a craven and a villain else , an 't please your Majesty , in my conscience .
If such a one be fit to govern , speak .
Where is he ?
Nay , not sure , in a thing falsing .
I will , lady .
Oh , falsely , falsely murdered !
Hark , Petruchio : she says she'll see thee hanged first .
How chance the king comes with so small a train ?
Some dear friend dead , else nothing in the world Could turn so much the constitution Of any constant man .
Sir , I commend you to your own content .
You , Nick Bottom , are set down for Pyramus .
How if the kiss be denied ?
You knew my father well , and in him me , Left solely heir to all his lands and goods , Which I have bettered rather than decreased .
I take some joy to say you are because I would be talking of her .
Dost thou hear ?
He hath twice or thrice cut Cupid's bow-string , and the little hangman dare not shoot at him .
Wilt thou have music ?
I gave you all , And in good time you gave it .
First , if all obstacles were cut away And that my path were even to the crown As the ripe revenue and due of birth , Yet so much is my poverty of spirit , So mighty and so many my defects , That I would rather hide me from my greatness , Being a bark to brook no mighty sea , Than in my greatness covet to be hid And in the vapor of my glory smothered .
Gratiano speaks an infinite deal of nothing , more than any man in all Venice .
Since Cassius first did whet me against Caesar , I have not slept .
Where is Duncan's body ?
Thou still hast been the father of good news .
There is occasions and causes why and wherefore in all things .
But lest myself be guilty to self wrong , I'll stop mine ears against the mermaid's song .
Not so , neither .
Come , go we to the king .
And now , good friends , As you are friends , scholars and soldiers , Give me one poor request .
O Cassio , Cassio , Cassio !
What bloody man is that ?
Ay , if Messala will prefer me to you .
What may she not ?
Come , let us sup betimes , that afterwards We may digest our complots in some form .
The spirit torments me .
And what hope is that , I pray thee ?
This only is the witchcraft I have used .
Out of my sight !
Why , I can buy me twenty at any market .
Be not afraid , though you do see me weaponed .
I know a wench of excellent discourse , Pretty and witty , wild and yet , too , gentle .
Who are you ?
Then you'll buy 'em to sell again .
I have sent twenty out to seek for you .
I am not to you known , Though in your state of honor I am perfect .
Conduct me to mine host .
There needs no ghost , my lord , come from the grave To tell us this .
My liberty .
Look , here comes Helena .
I oft delivered from his forfeitures Many that have at times made moan to me .
Let him go And presently prefer his suit to Caesar .
My master hath appointed me to go to Saint Luke's to bid the priest be ready to come against you come with your appendix .
Let it alone .
Was never widow had so dear a loss .
The devil himself could not pronounce a title More hateful to mine ear .
You are in the right .
What countryman ?
I hope she will be brief .
Thou hast not , cousin .
O Cassius , Brutus gave the word too early , Who , having some advantage on Octavius , Took it too eagerly .
Who knows if Donalbain be with his brother ?
I had most need of blessing , and "Amen" Stuck in my throat .
I'll make thee an example .
Thou hast a sister by the mother's side , Admired Octavia .
Prithee , peace .
He's almost slain , and Roderigo dead .
I am not in the giving vein today .
On thy love , I charge thee .
Go , prick thy face and over-red thy fear , Thou lily-livered boy .
What's the matter ?
My lord ?
They know your Grace hath cause and means and might ; So hath your Highness .
Is the chair empty ?
What shall I say ?
Turn , hellhound , turn !
God be with you all .
As with the meat , some undeserved fault I'll find about the making of the bed , And here I'll fling the pillow , there the bolster , This way the coverlet , another way the sheets .
Bleed , bleed , poor country !
Had I not Four or five women once that tended me ?
Such welcome and unwelcome things at once 'T is hard to reconcile .
I answer you ?
By two o'clock I will be with thee again .
If thou consider rightly of the matter , Caesar has had great wrong .
Look how the floor of heaven Is thick inlaid with patens of bright gold .
Too long a pause for that which you find there .
There's five to one .
My cousin tells him in his ear that he is in her heart .
Angels and ministers of grace defend us !
Best safety lies in fear .
Humbly on my knee I crave your blessing .
Th ' occasion speaks thee , and My strong imagination sees a crown Dropping upon thy head .
Thou hast by moonlight at her window sung With feigning voice verses of feigning love , And stol'n the impression of her fantasy With bracelets of thy hair , rings , gauds , conceits , Knacks , trifles , nosegays , sweetmeats , messengers Of strong prevailment in unhardened youth .
Certainly my conscience will serve me to run from this Jew , my master .
It is an accustomed action with her to seem thus washing her hands .
By heaven , I'll have 't .
Not that Adam that kept the Paradise , but that Adam that keeps the prison ; he that goes in the calf's skin that was killed for the Prodigal ; he that came behind you , sir , like an evil angel , and bid you forsake your liberty .
Prithee , peace .
And mine , to eke out hers .
Shall I keep your hogs and eat husks with them ?
Here , sir !
I will stop your mouth .
Your answer , sir , is enigmatical .
Are there no stones in heaven But what serve for the thunder ? , Precious villain !
When we our betters see bearing our woes , We scarcely think our miseries our foes .
So rare a wondered father and a wife Makes this place paradise .
Come , come .
And with the juice of this I'll streak her eyes And make her full of hateful fantasies .
Witness , you ever-burning lights above , You elements that clip us round about , Witness that here Iago doth give up The execution of his wit , hands , heart , To wronged Othello's service .
I do entreat your grace to pardon me .
I pray you , commend me to Mistress Squash , your mother , and to Master Peascod , your father .
The duke is humorous .
Why are you virtuous ?
I do entreat you , not a man depart , Save I alone , till Antony have spoke .
And what art thou , thou idol ceremony ?
Away !
And what other oath Than honesty to honesty engaged , That this shall be , or we will fall for it ?
What I should think of this I can not tell , But this I think : there's no man is so vain That would refuse so fair an offered chain .
I will not go today , and ere I do It shall be what o'clock I say it is .
I have noted it well .
Go comfort your cousin .
Fulvia thy wife is dead .
She was false as water .
What , in my sight ? , Bianca , get thee in .
Shake it off .
And so she did .
Sister , where thou ?
I'll yield him thee asleep , Where thou mayst knock a nail into his head .
Make thy two eyes , like stars , start from their spheres , Thy knotted and combined locks to part And each particular hair to stand on end , Like quills upon the fearful porpentine .
No more .
Can virtue hide itself ?
Now forth , Lord Constable and princes all , And quickly bring us word of England's fall .
Let them curtsy with their left legs , and not presume to touch a hair of my master's horse-tail till they kiss their hands .
Vouchsafe , defused infection of a man , Of these known evils but to give me leave By circumstance to curse thy cursed self .
I pant for life .
Benedick , didst thou note the daughter of Signior Leonato ?
False to me ?
And what confederacy have you with the traitors Late footed in the kingdom ?
I may say "thrusting" it , For piercing steel and darts envenomed Shall be as welcome to the ears of Brutus As tidings of this sight .
When were you wont to use my sister thus ?
Is 't possible you will away tonight ?
O mistress , villainy hath made mocks with love !
O Banquo , Banquo , Our royal master's murdered !
The ancient saying is no heresy .
I'll never see 't !
Tomorrow , sir , I wrestle for my credit , and he that escapes me without some broken limb shall acquit him well .
Messala !
But I had rather fast from all four days Than drink so much in one .
It shall do well .
Oh , the heavens !
And yours of Helena to me bequeath , Whom I do love and will do till my death .
But for all this thou shalt have as many dolors for thy daughters as thou canst tell in a year .
And supportable To make the dear loss have I means much weaker Than you may call to comfort you , for I Have lost my daughter .
That Herod's head I'll have !
Are our eyes our own ?
That's a fault .
She is too big , I hope , for me to compass .
Tis a pageant , To keep us in false gaze .
Who's within ?
O dolt !
But do not so .
But where is Kate ?
Then you will bring the chain to her yourself .
Trouble us not .
You !
Now Margaret's curse is fall'n upon our heads , When she exclaimed on Hastings , you , and I , For standing by when Richard stabbed her son .
Nor I .
And if your love Can labor ought in sad invention , Hang her an epitaph upon her tomb And sing it to her bones .
Assume a virtue if you have it not .
Well , go to .
Oh , villain that I am !
What , are you answered yet ?
Yes , I have gained my experience .
It lies in you .
I find not Myself disposed to sleep .
We'll draw cuts for the signior .
Signior Lodovico ?
Well , sir , then 'twill be dry .
He's married , madam .
I found it thrown in at the casement of my closet .
I take this offer then : pay the bond thrice And let the Christian go .
Mistake no more .
The breaking of so great a thing should make A greater crack .
Caesar , I go .
And I will purge thy mortal grossness so That thou shalt like an airy spirit go. , Peaseblossom , Cobweb , Moth , and Mustardseed !
As I intend to prosper and repent , So thrive I in my dangerous affairs Of hostile arms !
Be not afraid .
That I might sleep out this great gap of time My Antony is away .
Let music sound while he doth make his choice .
What's the news with thee ?
What had he done to you ?
He .
Though their injunction be to bar my doors And let this tyrannous night take hold upon you , Yet have I ventured to come seek you out And bring you where both fire and food is ready .
O heaven , O earth , bear witness to this sound And crown what I profess with kind event
My royal lord , You do not give the cheer .
My lord , the mayor of London comes to greet you .
But since it is as it is , mend it for your own good .
Now will I to the chink , To spy an I can hear my Thisbe's face .
Young boys and girls Are level now with men .
Then , if they die unprovided , no more is the king guilty of their damnation than he was before guilty of those impieties for the which they are now visited .
But what is your affair in Elsinore ?
And for their sake , In your fair minds let this acceptance take .
No , sir .
O , fie , fie , fie !
I have used thee , Filth as thou art , with human care , and lodged thee In mine own cell till thou didst seek to violate The honor of my child .
But here's a parchment with the seal of Caesar .
But now they rise again With twenty mortal murders on their crowns And push us from our stools .
Do not you love me ?
If you do free your children from the sword , Your children's children quits it in your age .
Portia , forgive me this enforced wrong , And in the hearing of these many friends I swear to thee , even by thine own fair eyes Wherein I see myself , Mark you but that !
Who talks of my nation ?
Now shall my friend Petruchio do me grace , And offer me disguised in sober robes To old Baptista as a schoolmaster Well seen in music , to instruct Bianca , That so I may , by this device at least , Have leave and leisure to make love to her And , unsuspected , court her by herself .
He is too disputable for my company .
Simple , plain Clarence , I do love thee so That I will shortly send thy soul to heaven , If heaven will take the present at our hands .
The plainsong" is most just , for humors do abound .
Then there's life in 't .
Did I deserve no more than a fool's head ?
Upon what cause ?
What's thy passion ?
But chiefly Him that you termed , sir , "the good old Lord Gonzalo , " His tears run down his beard like winter's drops From eaves of reeds .
Tis a good dullness , And give it way .
Tis true .
Then open not thy lips .
wherefore sink you down ?
What is thy name ?
Nym , thou hast spoke the right .
Ay , to me .
Caesar , I shall .
Caesar sends greeting to the Queen of Egypt , And bids thee study on what fair demands Thou mean'st to have him grant thee .
Tis well , sir , that you hunted for yourself .
Forever and forever farewell , Brutus .
Many good morrows to my noble lord .
I hope this passionate humor of mine will change .
It is the wittiest partition that ever I heard discourse , my lord .
Though he be as good a gentleman as the devil is , as Lucifer and Beelzebub himself , it is necessary , look your Grace , that he keep his vow and his oath .
Swear by your double self , And there's an oath of credit !
O Iago , the pity of it , Iago !
But I shall see The winged vengeance overtake such children .
Go after her .
So do the kings of France unto this day , Howbeit they would hold up this Salic law To bar your Highness claiming from the female And rather choose to hide them in a net Than amply to imbar their crooked titles Usurped from you and your progenitors .
Now , if these men have defeated the law and outrun native punishment , though they can outstrip men , they have no wings to fly from God .
His roguish madness Allows itself to any thing .
It is worth the pains .
You know I say nothing to him , for he understands not me , nor I him .
Do not say so , Lysander .
Shall we not ?
I love you with so much of my heart that none is left to protest .
As long as hell and Richard likes of it .
O Bottom , thou art changed !
It must be shortly known to him from England What is the issue of the business there .
No , dear Queen , For we intend so to dispose you as Yourself shall give us counsel .
A good sharp fellow .
What wilt thou do for her ?
What's thy name ?
Y ' have ungently , Brutus , Stole from my bed .
Lucentio , gentle sir .
That song tonight Will not go from my mind .
He thinks he still is at his instrument .
Hold , take my sword .
Then leave him out .
Give me the cups .
And I with him .
Bring me no more reports .
A worthy pioneer !
Oh , then , what graces in my love do dwell , That he hath turned a heaven unto a hell !
Yet I insisted ; yet you answered not , But with an angry wafture of your hand Gave sign for me to leave you .
I think I hear them. , Stand , ho !
My lord , you nod .
Till night , my lord , and all night too .
When I was with him I have heard him swear To Tubal and to Chus , his countrymen , That he would rather have Antonio's flesh Than twenty times the value of the sum That he did owe him .
Three in Egypt Can not make better note .
Only I yield to die .
I will watch tonight .
I will reward thee Once for thy sprightly comfort and tenfold For thy good valor .
Nay , faith , I'll see the church a ' your back , and then come back to my master's as soon as I can .
Didst thou see any thing ?
What should such fellows as I do crawling between earth and heaven ?
I will live in thy heart , die in thy lap , and be buried in thy eyes , and moreover , I will go with thee to thy uncle's .
I did so , and take heed on 't , Make it a darling like your precious eye .
Know you not the cause ?
They do offend our sight .
Then one of you will prove a shrunk panel and , like green timber , warp , warp .
What news from Genoa ?
My old bones ache .
Will you go see the order of the course ?
Good friend , I prithee , take him in thy arms .
My services which I have done the signiory Shall out-tongue his complaints .
Go you and maintain talk with the duke , that my charity be not of him perceived .
I'll see it done .
I will none of your money .
Give me your hands if we be friends , And Robin shall restore amends .
But for his purpose in the coronation , I have not sounded him , nor he delivered His gracious pleasure any way therein .
Hush and be mute , Or else our spell is marred .
How answer you for yourselves ?
Whence are you , sir ?
Fairer than tongue can name thee , let me have Some patient leisure to excuse myself .
Why , and I trust I may go too , may I not ?
God for Thy mercy , they are loose again !
Look what I speak , or do , or think to do , You are still crossing it .
To see a reverend Syracusian merchant , Who put unluckily into this bay Against the laws and statutes of this town , Beheaded publicly for his offense .
My lord .
The Emperor calls Canidius .
I do beseech you , sir , trouble yourself no further .
He is drowned Whom thus we stray to find , and the sea mocks Our frustrate search on land .
Very well .
Be assured you may .
It is not nor it can not come to good , But break , my heart , for I must hold my tongue .
Give me leave To speak my mind , and I will through and through Cleanse the foul body of th ' infected world , If they will patiently receive my medicine .
So may it be indeed .
Sir , I say to you we are none .
Prove that ever I lose more blood with love than I will get again with drinking , pick out mine eyes with a ballad-maker's pen and hang me up at the door of a brothel house for the sign of blind Cupid .
Let him speak , my lord , Upon his peril , that I have reserved To myself nothing .
O Cassio , Cassio , Cassio !
What think you of the Scottish lord , his neighbor ?
Good gentlemen , give him a further edge , And drive his purpose on to these delights .
Look to your house , your daughter , and your bags !
Go with my brothers to my lords of England .
O , 'twas the foulest deed to slay that babe , And the most merciless that e'er was heard of !
Stand , ho !
Now he'll outstare the lightning .
He , sir .
And laid the love juice on some true love's sight .
Prithee , keep up thy quillets .
Your man and you are marvelous merry , sir .
My face I'll grime with filth , Blanket my loins , elf all my hair in knots , And with presented nakedness outface The winds and persecutions of the sky .
Tis meet I should be used so , very meet .
God bless me from a challenge !
Strives in his little world of man to outscorn The to-and-fro-conflicting wind and rain .
Then shall we find tomorrow they have only stomachs to eat and none to fight .
Caesar gets money where He loses hearts .
But if it be a sin to covet honor , I am the most offending soul alive .
I trouble thee too much , but thou art willing .
Prepare we for our marriage ; on which day , My Lord of Burgundy , we'll take your oath , And all the peers ' , for surety of our leagues .
But I have , sir , a son by order of law , some year older than this , who yet is no dearer in my account .
I have professed me thy friend , and I confess me knit to thy deserving with cables of perdurable toughness .
Though it be pity to see such a sight , it well becomes the ground .
Tis known before .
By your patience , I needs must rest me .
Who's there ?
Do it .
Descend , brother , I say .
Tis a naughty night to swim in .
No watch ?
You lack a man's heart .
Will you grant with me That Ferdinand is drowned ?
They murder Caesar ! " , Who's within ?
I crave the law , The penalty , and forfeit of my bond .
But indeed an old religious uncle of mine taught me to speak , who was in his youth an inland man , one that knew courtship too well , for there he fell in love .
I attend them with all respect and duty .
As thou art to thyself .
He hath rid his prologue like a rough colt .
I have marked A thousand blushing apparitions To start into her face , a thousand innocent shames In angel whiteness beat away those blushes , And in her eye there hath appeared a fire To burn the errors that these princes hold Against her maiden truth .
Towards Chertsey , noble lord ?
Ah , do not tear away thyself from me !
Therefore I pray you lead me to the caskets To try my fortune .
Ay , now am I in Arden , the more fool I .
Didst not mark that ?
Then is there mirth in heaven When earthly things , made even , Atone together .
I prithee take the cork out of thy mouth , that I may drink thy tidings .
Your dinner , and the generous islanders By you invited , do attend your presence .
So is the bargain .
There he is .
But who comes here ?
Richmond is on the seas .
Hold , or cut bowstrings .
Then comes the time , who lives to see 't , That going shall be used with feet .
Come , where's the chain ?
I will not shame myself to give you this .
But that still use of grief makes wild grief tame , My tongue should to thy ears not name my boys Till that my nails were anchored in thine eyes , And I , in such a desp'rate bay of death , Like a poor bark of sails and tackling reft , Rush all to pieces on thy rocky bosom .
I , madam ?
The readiest way to make the wench amends Is to become her husband and her father ; The which will I , not all so much for love As for another secret close intent By marrying her which I must reach unto .
No further , sir .
My present business calls me from you now .
This done , he took the bride about the neck And kissed her lips with such a clamorous smack That at the parting all the church did echo .
All men's faces are true , whatsome'er their hands are .
You , Pyramus ' father. , Myself , Thisbe's father. , Snug the joiner , you , the lion's part. , And I hope here is a play fitted .
My suit to her Is that she will to virtuous Desdemona Procure me some access .
Here's yet some liquor left .
He only lived but till he was a man , The which no sooner had his prowess confirmed In the unshrinking station where he fought , But like a man he died .
Retire we to our chamber .
Madam , I will .
O vengeance !
One , Kate , that you must kiss and be acquainted with. , Where are my slippers ?
There's another garment for 't .
Thou shalt be lord of it and I'll serve thee .
You know no Centaur ?
Sola !
Antonio , as I heard in Genoa , What , what , what ?
This wedding day Perhaps is but prolonged .
Therein the patient Must minister to himself .
My being in Egypt , Caesar , what was 't to you ?
I'll mend it and then play , Where's the Queen ?
How chance thou art returned so soon ?
Both wind and tide stays for this gentleman , And I , to blame , have held him here too long .
I do the wrong , and first begin to brawl .
I will stand , and so shall Trinculo .
Now , I prithee , daughter , do not make me mad .
He needs not .
So let high-sighted tyranny range on Till each man drop by lottery .
Friar , it can not be .
Hear me , hear me what I say : he that strikes the first stroke , I'll run him up to the hilts , as I am a soldier .
Who calls ?
Tis very strange .
No , none by me .
Welcome , my good Alexas .
After the battle let George Stanley die .
He had one yesterday .
But I know none , and therefore am no beast .
But how hath she received his love ?
And a good soldier too , lady .
They'll tell all .
For this reason , if you'll know : That she's the choice love of Signior Gremio .
Happier than this , She is not bred so dull but she can learn .
Who's his lieutenant , hear you ?
Your cake there is warm within ; you stand here in the cold .
Peace , you were best .
What says that fool of Hagar's offspring , ha ?
If not , adieu .
These English woes will make me smile in France .
Rude ragged nurse , old sullen playfellow For tender princes , use my babies well .
You jig and amble , and you lisp , you nickname God's creatures and make your wantonness your ignorance .
In thy foul throat thou liest .
His fault is much , and the good king his master Will check him for 't .
Shall I have the thought To think on this , and shall I lack the thought That such a thing bechanced would make me sad ?
Delay not , Caesar .
I'll beat the knave into a twiggen bottle .
Would 't had been done !
Are you native of this place ?
Fare thee well .
For God's sake , send some other messenger .
We were Christians eno ' before , e'en as many as could well live one by another .
I shall devise something .
O Regan , Goneril , Your old kind father , whose frank heart gave all , Oh , that way madness lies .
Grant their lawful suit .
I am an ass , indeed ; you may prove it by my long ears. , I have served him from the hour of my nativity to this instant , and have nothing at his hands for my service but blows .
Set you down this ,
No , sir , 'tis in grain ; Noah's flood could not do it .
Wife , children , servants , all that could be found .
I say a husband .
Cowards die many times before their deaths .
Tell me , how fares our loving mother ?
Ay , sir , in Pisa have I often been , Pisa renowned for grave citizens .
Even here Do we shake hands .
No disgrace Shall fall you for refusing him at sea , Being prepared for land .
You must be father to your brother's daughter , And give her to young Claudio .
I have no hope That he's undrowned .
Ay , and a bold one , that dare look on that Which might appall the devil .
And welcome more common , for that's nothing but words .
I would have you .
Get thee gone , but do it .
Is Antony or we in fault for this ?
Revolving this will teach thee how to curse .
By this light , a most perfidious and drunken monster .
Good gentlemen , look fresh and merrily .
So call the field to rest , and let's away To part the glories of this happy day .
So kind a father ! , Be my horses ready ?
The fault's your own .
Jove shield thee well for this !
Saint Valentine is past .
Her name is Portia , nothing undervalued To Cato's daughter , Brutus ' Portia .
I pray thee , mark me .
Oh , by no means .
Under what title shall I woo for thee , That God , the law , my honor and her love Can make seem pleasing to her tender years ?
I have a daughter .
Is it two days ago since I tripped up thy heels and beat thee before the king ?
Twas a shame no less Than was his loss , to course your flying flags And leave his navy gazing .
No , you unnatural hags ,
Do you believe his "tenders , " as you call them ?
Those being all my study , The government I cast upon my brother And to my state grew stranger , being transported And rapt in secret studies .
She Phoebes me .
He can not flatter , he .
But forbear , I say .
No ?
My mistress here lies murdered in her bed , Oh , heavens forfend !
Nor will you not tell me who you are ?
Sent he to Macduff ?
I'll go farther off .
For our losses , his exchequer is too poor ; for th ' effusion of our blood , the muster of his kingdom too faint a number ; and for our disgrace , his own person , kneeling at our feet but a weak and worthless satisfaction .
Thou hast me , if thou hast me , at the worst , and thou shalt wear me , if thou wear me , better and better .
She shows a body rather than a life , A statue than a breather .
How am I then a villain To counsel Cassio to this parallel course , Directly to his good ?
He taught me how to know a man in love , in which cage of rushes I am sure you are not prisoner .
Nay , an you be a cursing hypocrite once , you must be looked to .
Will you hear me , Roderigo ?
Have mind upon your health , tempt me no further .
To that end , As matching to his youth and vanity , I did present him with the Paris balls .
You did .
Not if the small come first .
Nay , if an oily palm be not a fruitful prognostication , I can not scratch mine ear. , Prithee , tell her but a workaday fortune .
Your reason ?
Yes , sir .
I pray the gods she may , with all my heart !
Bless the isle of Cyprus and our noble general Othello !
Go , get thee hence .
If knife , drugs , serpents , have Edge , sting , or operation , I am safe .
There is no other shelter hereabouts .
Your servants ever Have theirs , themselves , and what is theirs in compt , To make their audit at your highness ' pleasure , Still to return your own .
To her , widow !
With him ?
This fellow doth not stand upon points .
Thou shouldst not have been old till thou hadst been wise .
Pray , then , foresee me one .
Madam , I trust , not so .
I do not like the office .
I will bandy with thee in faction .
Nor anyone .
Temperance was a delicate wench .
If he do blench , I know my course .
What need one ?
I must stay with the lackeys with the luggage of our camp .
Have you a mind to sink ?
Here comes a messenger .
This disease is beyond my practice .
You are naught , you are naught .
Caesar and Lepidus Are in the field .
No , truly not , although until last night I have this twelvemonth been her bedfellow .
Where's Peaseblossom ?
Would it were day !
She is a virtuous and a reverend lady .
He is then a giant to an ape ; but then is an ape a doctor to such a man .
Who bids thee call ?
I am sorry for thee , friend .
Graces will appear , and there's an end .
If thou beest not immortal , look about you .
But what will you be called ?
Get me a taper in my study , Lucius .
It was his bidding .
If thou hast any sound or use of voice , Speak to me .
I have said .
Thus we are agreed .
You are their heir , you sit upon their throne , The blood and courage that renowned them Runs in your veins ; and my thrice-puissant liege Is in the very May-morn of his youth , Ripe for exploits and mighty enterprises .
No , my good lord .
No , 'twas the vane on the house .
What other bond Than secret Romans that have spoke the word And will not palter ?
Fortune is merry , And in this mood will give us anything .
Be comforted , dear madam .
Cleopatra , Think you there was or might be such a man As this I dreamt of ?
Say boldly .
Tis certain then for Cyprus .
Avoid what is to come .
I know it well , sir .
Think so , Iago ?
What , Grumio !
How dost thou ?
But take a taste of my finding him , and relish it with good observance .
Thou shouldst be honest .
And so , God be with him !
I beseech you .
If thou the next night following enjoy not Desdemona , take me from this world with treachery and devise engines for my life .
Enobarbus , welcome .
Drink thou .
But now mine eyes , Which I have darted at thee , hurt thee not .
He says , my lord , your daughter is not well .
Sometimes from her eyes I did receive fair speechless messages .
I say it is the moon that shines so bright .
But I can tell why a snail has a house .
O , reform it altogether !
Look , here it is .
Say that I did all this for love of her .
I do now let loose my opinion , hold it no longer : this is no fish , but an islander that hath lately suffered by a thunderbolt .
Hast thou no care of me ?
If I were Brutus now and he were Cassius , He should not humor me .
That it would please you leave these sad designs To him that hath more cause to be a mourner , And presently repair to Crosby House , Where , after I have solemnly interred At Chertsey monast'ry this noble king And wet his grave with my repentant tears , I will with all expedient duty see you .
Infer fair England's peace by this alliance .
Get horses for your mistress .
You were kneeled to and importuned otherwise By all of us , and the fair soul herself Weighed between loathness and obedience , at Which end o ' th ' beam should bow .
Mine nightingale , We have beat them to their beds .
His Honor and myself are at the one , And at the other is my good friend Catesby , Where nothing can proceed that toucheth us Whereof I shall not have intelligence .
It seems that you scorn me .
If we are like you in the rest , we will resemble you in that .
Push home .
Therefore go with me .
Gloucester's eyes ?
He were no lion were not Romans hinds .
Wast thou mad , That thus so madly thou didst answer me ?
You wrong me , Brutus .
Soldiers , sir .
My father Is hard at study .
I have said .
What will you do ?
Thou sayest his sports were hinderd by thy brawls .
I ' th ' air or th ' earth ?
My Lord of Norfolk , Here , most gracious liege .
He sings at grave- making .
Why , then , I care not for thee .
Hail to your lordship .
It is as easy as lying .
Foul deeds will rise , Though all the earth o'erwhelm them , to men's eyes .
But will you woo this wildcat ?
To eat us hungerly , and when they are full , They belch us .
I wrote to you When rioting in Alexandria .
Alas , he faints !
Dream on , dream on , of bloody deeds and death .
Why do we wrap the gentleman in our more rawer breath ?
This deed of thine is no more worthy heaven Than thou wast worthy her .
We shall , my liege .
I speak but as I find .
O weary night , O long and tedious night , Abate thy hours .
The selfsame name , but one of better nature .
So-so" is good , very good , very excellent good .
Where be thy brothers ?
But let your fair eyes and gentle wishes go with me to my trial , wherein , if I be foiled , there is but one shamed that was never gracious ; if killed , but one dead that was willing to be so .
Speak this no more .
Mark him .
Upon condition Publius shall not live , Who is your sister's son , Mark Antony .
Which of you trembles not that looks on me ?
Are they not now upon the western shore , Safe-conducting the rebels from their ships ?
O Corin , that thou knew'st how I do love her !
Begone. , On , officer , to prison till it come .
I am informed thoroughly of the cause .
He is descried .
Your servant shall do so .
Would I could answer This comfort with the like .
Peace !
Why , a horse .
One inch of delay more is a South Sea of discovery .
Thank you .
Not tonight , good Iago .
My charms crack not , my spirits obey , and time Goes upright with his carriage .
Lie they upon thy hand And be undone by 'em !
No , let the candied tongue lick absurd pomp , And crook the pregnant hinges of the knee Where thrift may follow fawning .
Is it four o'clock ?
Swagger ?
In a false quarrel there is no true valor .
O nuncle , court holy water in a dry house is better than this rainwater out o ' door .
He shall tell them so .
None , my lord .
Was ever woman in this humor wooed ?
But 'tis a spirit .
Lear's shadow .
We should profane the service of the dead To sing a requiem and such rest to her As to peace-parted souls .
Let the doors be shut upon him , that he may play the fool no where but in 's own house .
Most learned judge , a sentence !
What follows , then , my lord ?
I dreamt there was an emperor Antony .
Come , be a man .
Marry , you may partly hope that your father got you not , that you are not the Jew's daughter .
Away , away , for he is coming hither !
Why , man , what is the matter ?
Come , tailor , let us see these ornaments .
Cassio , my lord , hath killed a young Venetian Called Roderigo .
Tranio , I saw her coral lips to move And with her breath she did perfume the air .
Touched you the bastardy of Edward's children ?
If they suffer our departure , death's the word .
Tomorrow , then , I judge a happy day .
Love looks not with the eyes but with the mind .
We think not so , my lord .
Sure , 'tis not so .
They are of Norway , sir .
He and Lepidus are at Caesar's house .
Now I begin : Imprimis , we came down a foul hill , my master riding behind my mistress , Both of one horse ?
Your betters have endured me say my mind , And if you can not , best you stop your ears .
Besides , they have burned and carried away all that was in the king's tent , wherefore the king , most worthily , hath caused every soldier to cut his prisoner's throat .
How ?
And shall , sir .
Even when you please , since you will have it so .
You best know the place .
Are those my tents where I perceive the fire ?
Natures of such deep trust we shall much need .
To save her life , I'll say she is not so .
Not see him since ?
Welcome , my friends all .
The age is grown so picked that the toe of the peasant comes so near the heel of the courtier he galls his kibe. , How long hast thou been a grave-maker ?
Nothing .
The foe vaunts in the field .
I do repent The tedious minutes I with her have spent .
If you deny them , all the land will rue it .
I know you are no truant .
Have you writ down that they are none ?
Look in the calendar and bring me word .
Go to .
No , my lord .
I have been your tenant and your father's tenant these fourscore years .
Far off methinks I hear the beaten drum .
But speak you this with a sad brow ?
I'll tell thee , Charles : it is the stubbornest young fellow of France , full of ambition , an envious emulator of every man's good parts , a secret and villainous contriver against me his natural brother .
Why , he was met even now As mad as the vexed sea , singing aloud , Crowned with rank fumiter and furrow-weeds , With burdocks , hemlock , nettles , cuckoo-flowers , Darnel , and all the idle weeds that grow In our sustaining corn. , A century send forth .
If he have never drunk wine afore , it will go near to remove his fit .
Oft have I heard of sanctuary men , But sanctuary children , ne'er till now .
I think it is .
You do extend These thoughts of horror further than you shall Find cause in Caesar .
Is it your dear friend that is thus in trouble ?
A segregation of the Turkish fleet .
O Antony , O thou Arabian bird !
Here , thou incestuous , murderous , damned Dane , Drink off this potion .
Where is thy husband now ?
Rosalind lacks then the love Which teacheth thee that thou and I am one .
O good old man , how well in thee appears The constant service of the antique world , When service sweat for duty , not for meed .
Till noon ?
What means your grace ?
For God's love , let me hear .
When think you that the sword goes up again ?
I speak not like a dotard nor a fool , As under privilege of age to brag What I have done being young , or what would do Were I not old .
And if it stand , as you yourself still do , Within the eye of honor , be assured My purse , my person , my extremest means Lie all unlocked to your occasions .
In your dumps ?
He was disposed to mirth , but on the sudden A Roman thought hath struck him. , Enobarbus !
I am your host .
No more a soldier .
By th ' clock 'tis day , And yet dark night strangles the travelling lamp .
I think our country sinks beneath the yoke .
Who will go with me ?
There's the cunning of it .
Watch me like Argus .
A tailor made thee .
To do thus I learned of thee .
My soul shall thine keep company to heaven .
If you have lost him , Why , I have lost him too .
I would it might prove the end of his losses .
Give him a present .
How canst thou cross this marriage ?
It is the bright day that brings forth the adder And that craves wary walking .
Your plainness and your shortness please me well .
He speaks well .
Thou seest the world , Volumnius , how it goes .
I know thee well , a serviceable villain , As duteous to the vices of thy mistress As badness would desire .
Where I have come , great clerks have purposed To greet me with premeditated welcomes , Where I have seen them shiver and look pale , Make periods in the midst of sentences , Throttle their practiced accent in their fears , And in conclusion dumbly have broke off , Not paying me a welcome .
What is the matter , masters ? , Honest Iago , that looks dead with grieving , Speak , who began this ?
It must be Nay , but hear you , Goodman Delver , Give me leave .
His hour is almost past .
O my Christian ducats !
What say you , Bottom ?
Tis sweating labor To bear such idleness so near the heart As Cleopatra this .
Clarence still breathes ; Edward still lives and reigns .
Though the nature of our quarrel yet never brooked parle , know now upon advice , it toucheth us both , that we may yet again have access to our fair mistress and be happy rivals in Bianca's love , to labor and effect one thing specially .
O sir , very well : here in your orchard .
Men may sleep , and they may have their throats about them at that time , and some say knives have edges .
My lord ?
Good nuncle , in , and ask thy daughters blessing .
So you shall .
What mean'st thou , that thou help'st me not ?
A could never abide carnation .
For I have seen more years , I'm sure , than ye .
That's two of his weapons .
Fathered he is , and yet he's fatherless .
Well , And well am like to do , for I perceive , Four feasts are toward .
What's this for ?
I was provoked by her sland'rous tongue , That laid their guilt upon my guiltless shoulders .
I am bound to thee forever .
Nay , then thou lov'st it not And all my pains is sorted to no proof .
To Dover .
I was a fine fool to take it .
There is not enough leek to swear by .
The poison of that lies in you to temper .
If I speak true !
And to that end we wished your Lordship here T ' avoid the censures of the carping world .
I am not a slut , though I thank the gods I am foul .
He no more shall see my face .
Lie not a night from home .
Should not upbraid our course .
But are not some whole that we must make sick ?
I have as much of this in art as you , But yet my nature could not bear it so .
Be merciful , great duke , to men of mold .
I would eat his heart in the marketplace .
I'll put it on .
My lord , upon the platform where we watch .
I knew your father .
Not honestly , my lord , but so covertly that no dishonesty shall appear in me .
Now tell me how long you would have her after you have possessed her .
I embrace it .
Ebbing men indeed Most often do so near the bottom run By their own fear or sloth .
It was well done , and thou shalt sleep again .
My master is grown quarrelsome .
Follow me .
Proceed , proceed .
My money is almost spent , I have been tonight exceedingly well cudgeled , and I think the issue will be I shall have so much experience for my pains .
For 'tis most easy Th ' inclining Desdemona to subdue In any honest suit .
What think you on 't ?
That same cowardly , giantlike ox-beef hath devoured many a gentleman of your house .
There , take it ; and much thanks for my good cheer .
Cobweb .
I'll tell thee , Aliena , I can not be out of the sight of Orlando .
I am armed and well prepared. , Give me your hand , Bassanio .
Now let it work .
Where's that mongrel ?
Make haste .
Let them go .
Yes , other men have ill luck too .
How now , Captain Macmorris , have you quit the mines ?
If any such there be , heaven pardon him !
Leave her to heaven And to those thorns that in her bosom lodge To prick and sting her .
Adieu .
It is almost morning , And yet I am sure you are not satisfied Of these events at full .
Thy lands and all things that thou dost call thine Worth seizure , do we seize into our hands Till thou canst quit thee by thy brother's mouth Of what we think against thee .
O you mighty gods , This world I do renounce , and in your sights Shake patiently my great affliction off .
You have good judgment in horsemanship .
Your son shall have my daughter with consent .
Wonder not till further warrant .
Is this face Hero's ?
As I have life and honor , there shall he sit till noon .
Within these ten days if that thou beest found So near our public court as twenty miles , Thou diest for it .
The rest aloof are the Dardanian wives , With bleared visages come forth to view The issue of th ' exploit. , Go , Hercules !
So do I ever For had I cursed now , I had cursed myself .
Then I will come to my mother by and by .
I pray you tell me .
Nay , send in time !
More shall they speak , for now I am bent to know , By the worst means , the worst .
This is kind I offer .
Were you well served , you would be taught your duty .
A pox o ' your bottle !
Grave sir , hail !
Nay , but who is it ?
And we did think it writ down in our duty To let you know of it .
Within this half hour will he be asleep .
Arise , I say !
If thou pleasest not , I yield thee up my life .
Or docks , or mallows .
Having once this juice , I'll watch Titania when she is asleep And drop the liquor of it in her eyes .
Master , if you do , expect spoon meat ; or bespeak a long spoon .
That you should here repent you , The actors are at hand , and by their show You shall know all that you are like to know .
I can not be so partial , Goneril , To the great love I bear you , Pray you , content .
Upon that I kiss your hand , and I call you my queen .
The foul'st best fits My latter part of life .
In truth , I know it is a sin to be a mocker , but he ! , why , he hath a horse better than the Neapolitan's , a better bad habit of frowning than the Count Palatine .
Now , for my life , Hortensio fears his widow .
O dainty duck !
To the vales , And hold our best advantage .
You wronged yourself to write in such a case .
Poor Ophelia Divided from herself and her fair judgment , Without the which we are pictures , or mere beasts .
How do you mean , removing of him ?
Let us go in , And charge us there upon interr'gatories , And we will answer all things faithfully .
Marry , sir , she's the kitchen wench , and all grease , and I know not what use to put her to but to make a lamp of her and run from her by her own light .
I can not think my sister in the least Would fail her obligation .
Let me know .
He shall live a man forbid .
Tut , fear not me .
See where they come .
Think and die .
Yet this is your harmless fairy , monster .
What do you think Of marching to Philippi presently ?
Doth it ?
In faith , hath not the world one man but he will wear his cap with suspicion ?
That's the next to do .
I will weep for nothing , like Diana in the fountain , and I will do that when you are disposed to be merry .
Messala , I have here received letters That young Octavius and Mark Antony Come down upon us with a mighty power , Bending their expedition toward Philippi .
He's a good fellow , I can tell you that .
Take heed , sirrah , the whip .
Call in the messengers .
God witness with me , I have wept for thine .
One woe doth tread upon another's heel , So fast they follow. , Your sister's drowned , Laertes .
Did he receive you well ?
I do beseech you , take it not amiss ; I can not , nor I will not , yield to you .
Caesar !
For , since the mortal and intestine jars 'Twixt thy seditious countrymen and us , It hath in solemn synods been decreed Both by the Syracusians and ourselves , To admit no traffic to our adverse towns .
Worse and worse !
The wildest hath not such a heart as you .
Yet you , the murderer , look as bright , as clear , As yonder Venus in her glimmering sphere .
Didst thou not say he lied ?
Farewell both .
My books and instruments shall be my company , On them to look and practice by myself .
Oh , beware , my lord , of jealousy !
Know you any , count ?
But hear thee , Gratiano .
I will not stay behind .
God help the noble Claudio !
I drunk !
I not doubt He came alive to land .
Be eloquent in my behalf to her .
Ho , let the door be locked .
I'll be with thee betimes .
While then , God be with you !
Here comes Lorenzo .
Moon and stars !
Take heed you fall not .
Let Rome be thus informed .
I prithee , who ?
But were the day come , I should wish it dark , That I were couching with the doctor's clerk .
She'll close and be herself whilst our poor malice Remains in danger of her former tooth .
Thou art The armorer of my heart .
But how , my lord , shall we resist it now ?
I am your spaniel .
Who would fardels bear , To grunt and sweat under a weary life , But that the dread of something after death , The undiscovered country from whose bourn No traveler returns , puzzles the will And makes us rather bear those ills we have Than fly to others that we know not of ?
Be patient till the last .
Ay , you did wish that I would make her turn .
Therefore away , to get our stuff aboard .
Who shall begin ?
Not one to throw at a dog .
It's true , good lieutenant .
First , I ask thee what they have done ; thirdly , I ask thee what's their offense ; sixth and lastly , why they are committed ; and , to conclude , what you lay to their charge .
Thou changed and self-covered thing , for shame !
Why , Belman is as good as he , my lord .
My lord , you once did love me .
Do not approach Till thou dost hear me call .
I pray you sir , go forth And give us truth who 'tis that is arrived .
You have of late stood out against your brother , and he hath ta'en you newly into his grace , where it is impossible you should take true root but by the fair weather that you make yourself .
Go to , well said , well said .
My master's a very Jew .
Weigh it but with the grossness of this age , You break not sanctuary in seizing him .
We have scorched the snake , not killed it .
I would have him nine years a-killing .
Good my lord , enter here .
How have I been behaved that he might stick The small'st opinion on my least misuse ?
But who was this ?
And thither will I straight to visit him .
Fair sir , and you , my merry mistress , That with your strange encounter much amazed me , My name is called Vincentio , my dwelling Pisa , And bound I am to Padua , there to visit A son of mine which long I have not seen .
That shall you know hereafter .
He longs to eat the English .
If wolves had at thy gate howled that stern time , Thou shouldst have said , "Good porter , turn the key , " All cruels else subscribed .
How many then should cover that stand bare !
I am a gentleman of blood and breeding , And from some knowledge and assurance offer This office to you .
Farewell .
To a nunnery , go .
The will !
None that I know will be ; much that I fear may chance .
I will give treason his payment into plows , I warrant you .
Also King Lewis the Tenth , Who was sole heir to the usurper Capet , Could not keep quiet in his conscience , Wearing the crown of France , till satisfied That fair Queen Isabel , his grandmother , Was lineal of the Lady Ermengare , Daughter to Charles the foresaid duke of Lorraine , By the which marriage the line of Charles the Great Was reunited to the crown of France .
I go , my lord .
Give me audience , good madam .
Alas , thou hast misconstrued everything !
Most noble Caesar !
That's not so good now .
I know his gait , 'tis he. , Villain , thou diest !
As you shall prove us , praise us .
What ?
All three Now marry in an instant .
All will be well .
Come , you look paler and paler .
I'll seal to such a bond , And say there is much kindness in the Jew .
She is low-voiced .
At least I'm sure it may be so in Denmark .
Most certain .
Go with me to a notary , seal me there Your single bond , and , in a merry sport , If you repay me not on such a day , In such a place , such sum or sums as are Expressed in the condition , let the forfeit Be nominated for an equal pound Of your fair flesh , to be cut off and taken In what part of your body pleaseth me .
And for the Jew's bond which he hath of me , Let it not enter in your mind of love .
Hence , Lest that th ' infection of his fortune take Like hold on thee .
No , as I shall be saved .
I love her ten times more than e'er I did .
I am thus bold to put your Grace in mind Of what you promised me .
Bring him through the bands .
My lord is not my lord , nor should I know him Were he in favor as in humor altered .
They shall , Nerissa , but in such a habit That they shall think we are accomplished With that we lack .
All but mariners Plunged in the foaming brine and quit the vessel , Then all afire with me .
Our duties , and the pledge .
Is 't possible ?

The several messengers From hence attend dispatch .
I have yet Room for six scotches more .
Away !
Enough .

Now go thy way .
Why , my boy ?
Alas , sir , it is worse for me than so , For I have bills for money by exchange From Florence , and must here deliver them .
Humbly , sir , I thank you .
By th ' law of arms thou wast not bound to answer An unknown opposite .
You are both sure , and will assist me ?
Oh , misery !
Let it suffice thee that I trust thee not .
Where is my love ?
Cassio !
Arrest him , officer .
Tis a day Such as the day is when the sun is hid .
My lord , from head to foot .
What , go you toward the Tower ?
And , as you said ( and wisely was it said ) 'T is meet that some more audience than a mother , Since nature makes them partial , should o'erhear The speech , of vantage .
We all stand up against the spirit of Caesar , And in the spirit of men there is no blood .

She that was ever fair and never proud , Had tongue at will and yet was never loud , Never lacked gold and yet went never gay , Fled from her wish and yet said "Now I may , " She that being angered , her revenge being nigh , Bade her wrong stay and her displeasure fly , She that in wisdom never was so frail To change the cod's head for the salmon's tail , She that could think and ne'er disclose her mind , See suitors following and not look behind , She was a wight , if ever such wights were , To do what ?
Is she not apt ?
Orlando .
I do beseech your Grace , Let me the knowledge of my fault bear with me .

Thus runs the bill .
Hast thou affections ?
Most reverend signior , do you know my voice ?
Pray you , let's sit together .
Not so .
Whither are they vanished ?
No , Corin , being old , thou canst not guess , Though in thy youth thou wast as true a lover As ever sighed upon a midnight pillow .
How say you now ?
Furthermore , I pray you show my youth old Shylock's house .
That's our offer .
I know I can not please you .
My lord , they stay for you to give your daughter to her husband .
Why , who would not make her husband a cuckold to make him a monarch ?
But , hold thee , take this garland on thy brow .
Speak .
For who would bear the whips and scorns of time , Th ' oppressor's wrong , the proud man's contumely , The pangs of despised love , the law's delay , The insolence of office , and the spurns That patient merit of th ' unworthy takes , When he himself might his quietus make With a bare bodkin ?
Well said .

Or would you have me speak after my custom , as being a professed tyrant to their sex ?

Who was 't came by ?
What from the cape can you discern at sea ?
No , my most wronged sister .
And this cuff was but to knock at your ear and beseech list'ning .

Hast thou not dropped from heaven ?
Soldier , you must come to the king .
Here let them lie Till famine and the ague eat them up .
Mark it , nuncle .
Welcome , good Cambio .
Come on and kiss me , Kate .
Brother , Content yourself .

Hail .
I wish mine eyes Would with themselves shut up my thoughts .

Ah , women , women !
Hortensio , peace .
I doubt not of your wisdom .
I come to bury Caesar , not to praise him .
Good morrow , Kate , for that's your name , I hear .
Here's that , I warrant you , will pay them all .

Let's follow the old earl , and get the Bedlam To lead him where he would .
Many a man would take you at your word And go indeed , having so good a mean .
Upon the talk of the poisoning ?
What , must I hold a candle to my shames ?
Stay , though thou kill me , sweet Demetrius .
I pray you , look upon her .
Tis cowardly and womanish .
Yea , just so much as you may take upon a knife's point and choke a daw withal .
Arise , dissembler .
Why might not you , my lord , receive attendance From those that she calls servants , or from mine ?
He shall pay for him that hath him , and that soundly .
He seeks my life .
This course I fittest choose , For forty ducats is too much to lose .
To do this is within the compass of man's wit , and therefore I will attempt the doing it .

Well , get thee gone .
What needed , then , that terrible dispatch of it into your pocket ?
If you will live , lament .
Good news , good news !

Oh , that I were a man !
It is but trash .
It is no matter .
Now will I question Cassio of Bianca , A huswife that by selling her desires Buys herself bread and clothes .
Is that his answer ?

He is simply the most active gentleman of France .

Lysander , whereto tends all this ?
Note him , Note him , good Charmian , 'tis the man , but note him .

This is old .
Fear nothing .
Old fashions please me best .

Why came I hither but to that intent ?
God's arm strike with us !
Nothing , my lord , or if , I know not what .
Or do you play the flouting jack , to tell us Cupid is a good hare-finder and Vulcan a rare carpenter ?
Is thy master coming ?
And is it thus ?

No more of drowning , do you hear ?
Where , my lord ?
Go , fetch me something : I'll break ope the gate .
Let their heads be slickly combed , their blue coats brushed , and their garters of an indifferent knit .
In sooth , I know not why I am so sad .
Were such things here as we do speak about ?
Do thy worst .

He does hear me , And that he does I weep .
My lord , you shall o'errule my mind for once. , Come on , Lord Hastings , will you go with me ?

Then are our beggars bodies , and our monarchs and outstretched heroes the beggars ' shadows .
But for your words , they rob the Hybla bees And leave them honeyless .
And my heart too .
I'll catch it ere it come to ground .
I am glad to see you .
Why , you gave no gold to me !
The duke's to blame in this .
You say he dined at home ; the goldsmith here Denies that saying .
Take thou the bill , give me thy mete- yard , and spare not me .
Your features , Lord warrant us !
Tyranny is dead !
Come , come , you are a fool , And turned into the extremity of love .
His name is Balthazar .
And the hour , I think , is come To give him hearing .
Should I lie , madam ?
To tell thee thou shalt see me at Philippi .
As manhood shall compound .
Ha , ha , ha !
Their bloody sign of battle is hung out , And something to be done immediately .
Thou bring'st me out of tune .
O Lord , Lord , it is a hard matter for friends to meet , but mountains may be removed with earthquakes and so encounter .
If he be , he knows how to turn his girdle .
For Christian shame , put by this barbarous brawl .
Ay , there's the villany .
Well , I'll go hide the body in some hole Till that the duke give order for his burial .
I have told thee often , and I re-tell thee again and again , I hate the Moor .
Leonato , stand I here ?
Hail , Caesar , and my lord !
The foul fiend bites my back .
And I must Rid all the sea of pirates , then , to send Measures of wheat to Rome .
O sir , pardon me !
If I do live , I will be good to thee .
Pardon this fault , and by my soul I swear I never more will break an oath with thee .
I thought thou hadst been resolute .
It shall be seven ere I go to horse .
Either there is a civil strife in heaven , Or else the world , too saucy with the gods , Incenses them to send destruction .
I am a gentleman , sir , and my name is Conrade .
Oh , behold How pomp is followed !
Mustardseed .
Nay , good Lysander .
Stay , dog , for thou shalt hear me .
Most noble Antony !
Why , then thou canst not break her to the lute ?
The sun !
Now he is a-praying .
This was but as a fly by an eagle .
And look when I am king , claim thou of me The earldom of Hereford , and all the moveables Whereof the king my brother was possessed .
A sovereign shame so elbows him .
Shut up your doors .
Damned as thou art , thou hast enchanted her !
My lord , we were sent for .
My lord it shall be done .
Is this well done ?
Cassio's a proper man .
Tomorrow , my lord .
It is not possible .
For though she's as like this as a crab's like an apple , yet I can tell what I can tell .
Ha , art thou bedlam ?
I will so .
Yet here's a spot .
Happiest of all is that her gentle spirit Commits itself to yours to be directed As from her lord , her governor , her king .
Shall I go win my daughter to thy will ?
Wouldst thou do such a deed for all the world ?
This health to Lepidus !
Let us not leave him out .
Is it even so ?
Therefore I will depart unkissed .
Bid farewell to your sisters .
But yet , alas , stood I within his grace , I would prefer him to a better place .
Our brother is imprisoned by your means , Myself disgraced , and the nobility Held in contempt , while great promotions Are daily given to ennoble those That scarce some two days since were worth a noble .
But tell me yet , dost thou not know my voice ?
The fault of it I'll answer .
Why thou , loss upon loss !
But when shall we set the savage bull's horns on the sensible Benedick's head ?
Is yonder the man ?
You saw they speak us fair , give us gold .
And mine , but it grows something stale with me .
It was ourself thou didst abuse .
By my troth , niece , thou wilt never get thee a husband if thou be so shrewd of thy tongue .
We have not yet set down this day of triumph .
Be'st thou sad or merry , The violence of either thee becomes , So does it no man else. , Mett'st thou my posts ?
But for the seventh cause .
Good morrow , Prince ; good morrow , Claudio .
I am not so well as I should be , but I'll ne'er out .
How now !
Thy substance , valued at the highest rate , Can not amount unto a hundred marks ; Therefore by law thou art condemned to die .
What the goodyear , my lord , why are you thus out of measure sad ?
We have not spoke us yet of torchbearers .
Come with a thought .
Thy life hath had some smatch of honor in it .
For this slave , If there be any cunning cruelty That can torment him much and hold him long , It shall be his .
Either heaven with lightning strike the murderer dead , Or earth gape open wide and eat him quick , As thou dost swallow up this good king's blood , Which his hell-governed arm hath butchered !
Now am I dead .
Calphurnia here , my wife , stays me at home .
Oh weary reckoning !
And what have kings that privates have not too , Save ceremony , save general ceremony ?
Thou baggage , let me in .
I understand a fury in your words , But not the words .
Here Catesby comes again .
Is not their climate foggy , raw , and dull , On whom , as in despite , the sun looks pale , Killing their fruit with frowns ?
Will you enforce me to a world of cares ?
He is very near by this .
No , sir .
This is a devil , and no monster .
Here's that shall drive some of them to a noncome .
You mistake , sir , you mistake , sir .
Pleaseth you walk with me down to his house , I will discharge my bond and thank you too .
Madam , I had rather seal my lips Than to my peril speak that which is not .
And may not young men die as well as old ?
Get you gone And hasten your return .
I would have her learn , my fair cousin , how perfectly I love her , and that is good English .
Praised be God , and not our strength , for it !
sits. , I did never think that lady would have loved any man .
Well , masters , we hear our charge .
Lysander's love , that would not let him bide , Fair Helena , who more engilds the night Than all yon fiery oes and eyes of light .
No , trust me , sir , nor I. I am sure thou dost .
The patch is kind enough , but a huge feeder , Snail-slow in profit , and he sleeps by day More than the wildcat .
Even he , madam .
The Prince and Claudio promised by this hour To visit me. , You know your office , brother .
Macbeth !
I humbly thank your ladyship .
Read the will !
You know the character to be your brother's ?
Mistress , how mean you that ?
If only to go warm were gorgeous , Why , nature needs not what thou gorgeous wear'st , Which scarcely keeps thee warm .
Treachery !
Asses are made to bear , and so are you .
Is this a holiday ?
And you must cut this flesh from off his breast .
First , Pyramus must draw a sword to kill himself , which the ladies can not abide .
Gentle lady , When I did first impart my love to you , I freely told you , all the wealth I had Ran in my veins .
It shall be called "Bottom's Dream" because it hath no bottom .
His eyes are humbler than they used to be .
Thy bed , lust-stained , shall with lust's blood be spotted .
What is a traitor ?
And your experience makes you sad .
Know then I came before you here a man prepared To take this offer , but Mark Antony Put me to some impatience .
Most certain .
Now is the day we long have looked for .
Nay , guiltiness Will speak , though tongues were out of use .
I saw him once .
Grumio , my horse .
I am paid for 't now .
Now sits the wind fair , and we will aboard .
Tomorrow , soldier , By sea and land I'll fight .
Look behind you , my lord .
Ready .
Are they married , think you ?
How dost thou like the Lord Bassanio's wife ?
But though my cates be mean , take them in good part .
What , shall I stab him as he sleeps ?
Utter my thoughts ?
It is well .
I'll make you amends next , to give you nothing for something .
He grows worse and worse .
The king , sir , Ay , sir , what of him ?
Thus losers part .
I will run , fiend .
But Brutus says he was ambitious , And Brutus is an honorable man .
Bid me farewell .
Let us all embrace .
Now , as you are a Roman , tell me true .
I wonder at it .
Welcome , Iago .
Tell me this , I pray : Where have you left the money that I gave you ?
Did you see Master Lorenzo ?
To these injunctions every one doth swear That comes to hazard for my worthless self .
Say I am sick .
I will challenge him .
Then learn this of me : to have is to have .
The worst fault you have is to be in love .
You would say so , master , if your garments were thin .
What are you ?
An it had not fallen flat-long .
Hath not a Jew hands , organs , dimensions , senses , affections , passions ?
Nor for yours neither .
Then I , and you , and all of us fell down , Whilst bloody treason flourished over us .
Therefore he hates me .
Fathers , from hence trust not your daughters ' minds By what you see them act .
The evil that men do lives after them ; The good is oft interred with their bones .
But how long fairly shall her sweet life last ?
Humbly I thank your grace .
Thyself art coming To see performed the dreaded act which thou So sought'st to hinder .
You have served me well , And kings have been your fellows .
I have a device to make all well .
The same indeed , a very valiant fellow .
Good my lord , vouchsafe me a word with you .
You nimble lightnings , dart your blinding flames Into her scornful eyes !
how am I beset ! , What kind of catechizing call you this ?
I thank you , sir .
I pray you , will you take him by the arm ?
I'll to the throng .
I was the other day talking on the sea-bank with certain Venetians , and thither comes the bauble and , by this hand , she falls me thus about my neck , Crying "O dear Cassio ! " as it were .
Good signior , you shall more command with years Than with your weapons .
Peter Quince , What sayest thou , bully Bottom ?
I shall deliver so .
The perdition of th ' athversary hath been very great , reasonable great .
I will laugh like a hyena , and that when thou art inclined to sleep .
Instance , briefly .
Hence , Mardian , And bring me how he takes my death .
Had you not come upon your cue , my lord , William Lord Hastings had pronounced your part , I mean your voice for crowning of the king .
I have ever held my cap off to thy fortunes .
I would your grace would constrain me to tell .
Here's a good world the while .
Hast thou forgot her ?
There's two or three of us have seen strange sights .
God speak this "amen" !
You must not think then that I am drunk .
As I learned , The night before there was no purpose in them Of this remove .
He were a brave monster indeed , if they were set in his tail .
Fare you well , boy .
Thou praisest the worst best .
Threescore and ten I can remember well , Within the volume of which time I have seen Hours dreadful and things strange , but this sore night Hath trifled former knowings .
I will talk further with you .
If you would take the pains but to examine the wars of Pompey the Great , you shall find , I warrant you , that there is no tiddle toddle nor pibble babble in Pompey's camp .
Is not your lord honorable without marriage ?
Tis a shrewd doubt , though it be but a dream .
Yes , gracious madam .
Then away she started To deal with grief alone .
Self-harming jealousy , fie , beat it hence .
Captain Jamy is a marvelous falorous gentleman , that is certain , and of great expedition and knowledge in th ' aunchient wars , upon my particular knowledge of his directions .
Ay , my liege , so please you give us leave .
Let us on heaps go offer up our lives .
Say , "the brave Antony." The valiant Caesar !
And yonder , Caesar .
Sleeping and waking , O , defend me still !
What is thy will with her ?
Are you not Kent ?
I can no more .
Hail , most dear Caesar !
Give to a gracious message An host of tongues , but let ill tidings tell Themselves when they be felt .
Your brother , no , no brother , yet the son , Yet not the son , I will not call him son , Of him I was about to call his father Hath heard your praises , and this night he means To burn the lodging where you use to lie , And you within it .
My soul is full of sorrow .
I marvel what kin thou and thy daughters are .
Ay , when the special thing is well obtained , That is , her love , for that is all in all .
For the which , as I told you , Antonio shall be bound .
Whither goest thou ?
I thank you , gentle uncle .
Caius Ligarius doth bear Caesar hard , Who rated him for speaking well of Pompey .
First kiss me , Kate , and we will .
Were not my doors locked up and I shut out ?
About it !
You are not , Cassius .
Doth Fortune play the huswife with me now ?
And second father This lady makes him to me .
No , that you shall not till you take her hand Before this friar and swear to marry her .
On me , whose all not equals Edward's moiety ?
At night we'll feast together .
It hath been The untimely emptying of the happy throne And fall of many kings .
I do remember now .
Soft !
The little strength that I have , I would it were with you .
Satan , avoid !
Were never orphans had so dear a loss .
I know our country disposition well .
And maidens call it "love-in-idleness." Fetch me that flower .
Soft and fair , Friar. , Which is Beatrice ?
How doth the lady ?
The fault , dear Brutus , is not in our stars But in ourselves , that we are underlings .
Why , Gloucester , Gloucester , I'd speak with the Duke of Cornwall and his wife .
Know'st thou Gower ?
If haply you my father do suspect An instrument of this your calling back , Lay not your blame on me .
Not ?
Approach .
Let every soldier hew him down a bough And bear 't before him .
He hath brought many captives home to Rome Whose ransoms did the general coffers fill .
He looks gentler than he did .
But , in faith , Kate , the elder I wax , the better I shall appear .
Knock , knock !
Why do you dress me In borrowed robes ?
Am I not stayed for ?
With all my heart , so thou canst get a wife .
But it sufficeth that the day will end , And then the end is known. , Come , ho !
My lord , what is your will ?
Of my kind uncle , that I know will give , And being but a toy , which is no grief to give .
I marvel Cambio comes not all this while .
A maiden never bold , Of spirit so still and quiet that her motion Blushed at herself .
O sir , content you .
The mercy that was quick in us but late By your own counsel is suppressed and killed .
It is a fault that springeth from your eye .
Well , sit we down , And let us hear Barnardo speak of this .
I pray you , uncle , give me this dagger .
Let us rather Hold fast the mortal sword and , like good men , Bestride our downfall'n birthdom .
Tis but a man gone .
Here I am Antony , Yet can not hold this visible shape , my knave .
And so , his knell is knolled .
I would not marry her , though she were endowed with all that Adam had left him before he transgressed .
What should this mean ?
Bid them achieve me and then sell my bones .
Methinks you are my glass , and not my brother : I see by you I am a sweet-faced youth .
Petruchio , patience .
An adder did it , for with doubler tongue Than thine , thou serpent , never adder stung .
You shall not choose but drink before you go .
Be not afeard .
Be subject To no sight but thine and mine , invisible To every eyeball else .
And then he drew a dial from his poke And , looking on it with lackluster eye , Says very wisely , "It is ten o'clock .
If it were done when 'tis done , then 'twere well It were done quickly .
I will , my lord , with all convenient haste .
And now methinks I have a mind to it .
Who does i' th' wars more than his captain can Becomes his captain's captain ; and ambition , The soldier's virtue , rather makes choice of loss Than gain which darkens him .
This wretch hath part confessed his villainy .
But what prevention ?
My worthy Cawdor !
I know you are of her bosom .
So shall you quietly enjoy your hope And marry sweet Bianca with consent .
Turn melancholy forth to funerals .
Therefore I'll sleep again .
What art thou , fellow ?
Eight wild boars roasted whole at a breakfast , and but twelve persons there !
This fellow I remember Since once he played a farmer's eldest son .
How low am I ?
Yes , a dozen , and as many to th ' vantage as would store the world they played for .
Sirrah , I'll teach thee a speech .
The worms were hallowed that did breed the silk , And it was dyed in mummy which the skillful Conserved of maidens ' hearts .
I do not know what "poetical" is .
God rest you merry , sir .
No , fair princess .
Let us seek out some desolate shade and there Weep our sad bosoms empty .
Barnardo has my place .
Seyton !
Take them in .
Cursed be thy stones for thus deceiving me !
Why does the world report that Kate doth limp ?
Come , come , away .
Show .
Cassio , may you suspect Who they should be that have thus mangled you ?
Sooth , la , I'll help .
The tempest in my mind Doth from my senses take all feeling else Save what beats there , filial ingratitude .
For , as I am a soldier , A name that in my thoughts becomes me best , If I begin the batt'ry once again , I will not leave the half-achieved Harfleur Till in her ashes she lie buried .
His lecture will be done ere you have tuned .
Brutus , my country's friend .
But there's no bottom , none , In my voluptuousness .
Let us score their backs And snatch 'em up , as we take hares , behind !
That I have labored With all my wits , my pains , and strong endeavors , To bring your most imperial Majesties Unto this bar and royal interview , Your mightiness on both parts best can witness .
Now am I Dromio , and his man , unbound .
Now .
Till then sit still , my soul .
Or I , I promise thee .
Friends , begone .
You wrong me , Signior Gremio .
I see , sir , you are liberal in offers .
I must attend mine office , Or would have done 't myself .
By the mess , ere theise eyes of mine take themselves to slomber , ay'll de gud service , or I'll lig i ' th ' grund for it , ay , or go to death .
Good old knight , Collect them all together at my tent .
Thank God." A good answer .
Tis hatched , and shall be so .
Fare you well .
A most ridiculous monster , to make a wonder of a poor drunkard .
Why , what's the matter ?
What answer , sir ?
Till Birnam Wood remove to Dunsinane I can not taint with fear .
Stand close and list him .
You see how easily she may be surprised .
Nay , hear them , Antony .
I'll get me to a place more void , and there Speak to great Caesar as he comes along .
Good madam , hear me .
But jealous souls will not be answered so .
If any ship put out , then straight away .
Here was a Caesar !
This thou shalt answer .
Varrus and Claudio !
If thou hadst feared to break an oath by Him , Th ' imperial metal circling now thy head Had graced the tender temples of my child , And both the princes had been breathing here , Which now , two tender bedfellows for dust , Thy broken faith hath made the prey for worms .
If every of your wishes had a womb , And fertile every wish , a million .
Grieve not that I am fall'n to this for you , For herein Fortune shows herself more kind Than is her custom .
If any , speak , for him have I offended .
Fa , sol , la , mi .
Put money enough in your purse .
And I beseech you instantly to visit My too much changed son .
And did you see the handkerchief ?
My lord , his majesty bade me signify to you that he has laid a great wager on your head .
I tell thee , Constable , my mistress wears his own hair .
For mine own good , All causes shall give way .
You have trained me like a peasant , obscuring and hiding from me all gentlemanlike qualities .
Thou hast done a deed , I care not for thy sword , I'll make thee known
Now my charms are all o'erthrown , And what strength I have's mine own , Which is most faint .
It is the rival of my love .
You received no gold ?
Die for adultery ?
Sister , it is not a little I have to say of what most nearly appertains to us both .
Why , that's all one .
My hour is almost come When I to sulfurous and tormenting flames Must render up myself .
Tis a strange serpent .
Would you were not sick !
It shall be said his judgment ruled our hands .
All is confirmed , my lord , which was reported .
I have heard it over , And it is nothing , nothing in the world , Unless you can find sport in their intents , Extremely stretched and conned with cru 'l pain To do you service .
Go with me , Silvius .
What should I do with him ?
Dear Duff , I prithee , contradict thyself , And say it is not so .
God send you joy , Petruchio .
Brutus" will start a spirit as soon as "Caesar." Now in the names of all the gods at once , Upon what meat doth this our Caesar feed That he is grown so great ?
Break an hour's promise in love ?
But is he often thus ?
If I see anything tonight why I should not marry her , tomorrow in the congregation , where I should wed , there will I shame her .
Faith , e'en with losing his wits .
Tis true .
Doth he not deserve well ?
The table's full .
For me , I'll not be gone till I please myself .
Behold !
Please you , draw near. , Louder the music there !
The death of Antony Is not a single doom .
Come , come !
And now forward with thy tale .
Oh , let me see thee walk !
Young gentleman , your spirits are too bold for your years .
Now , by my troth , if I had been remembered , I could have given my uncle's grace a flout To touch his growth nearer than he touched mine .
The king's son , Ferdinand , With hair up-staring , then , like reeds , not hair , Was the first man that leaped , cried , "Hell is empty And all the devils are here." Why , that's my spirit !
Come , come , dispatch .
To whose hands You have sent the lunatic king .
They would be better if well followed .
I'll put myself in poor and mean attire And with a kind of umber smirch my face .
How !
That's as we list to grace him .
The old man and his people Can not be well bestowed .
Let him that loves me strike me dead .
The dropsy drown this fool !
These be good humors .
Do thou meet me presently at the harbor. , Come hither .
He'll but break a comparison or two on me , which , peradventure not marked or not laughed at , strikes him into melancholy , and then there's a partridge wing saved , for the fool will eat no supper that night .
Go , go , dispatch .
Marry , and did .
By the mass , I was about to say something .
I love thee well in that thou lik'st it not .
Go you , call hither my fool .
I know him not .
But yet I run before my horse to market .
I pray you , leave me .
Are there balance here to weigh The flesh ?
No ?
Ay , marry , why was he sent into England ?
Show his eyes and grieve his heart .
He died As one that had been studied in his death To throw away the dearest thing he owed As 'twere a careless trifle .
Before God , and in my mind , very wise .
A many of our bodies shall no doubt Find native graves , upon the which , I trust , Shall witness live in brass of this day's work .
Come away , servant , come .
Look , here comes a walking fire .
And will you , being a man of your breeding , be married under a bush like a beggar ?
My spirits are nimble .
We are their parents and original .
So be gone .
So am I purposed .
Your rye-straw hats put on , And these fresh nymphs encounter every one In country footing .
I could munch your good dry oats .
That nothing do but meditate on blood , To swearing and stern looks , diffused attire , And everything that seems unnatural .
I do not bid the thunder-bearer shoot , Nor tell tales of thee to high-judging Jove .
Look , where thy love comes .
But , too unruly deer , he breaks the pale And feeds from home .
My wit's diseased .
But let us rear The higher our opinion , that our stirring Can from the lap of Egypt's widow pluck The ne'er lust-wearied Antony .
The glowworm shows the matin to be near , And 'gins to pale his uneffectual fire .
Tut , I have the best armor of the world .
Misery acquaints a man with strange bedfellows .
Fie upon "But yet." "But yet" is as a jailer to bring forth Some monstrous malefactor .
God quit you in His mercy .
Well , sir , we will not .
Naughty lady , These hairs which thou dost ravish from my chin Will quicken and accuse thee .
My son Came then into my mind , and yet my mind Was then scarce friends with him .
Yea , my lord , but I can cross it .
Here , kiss the book .
Mark Antony is in your tents , my lord .
Come , draw the curtain , Nerissa .
Fellow , come from the throng .
I prithee , turn aside and weep for her .
Old lord , I can not blame thee , Who am myself attached with weariness To th ' dulling of my spirits .
Hark !
Made it for me , sir ?
Mine eyes do itch , Doth that bode weeping ?
If it please you .
My hair doth stand an end to hear her curses .
He hath no daughters , sir .
Do you find some occasion to anger Cassio , either by speaking too loud , or tainting his discipline , or from what other course you please , which the time shall more favorably minister .
Pray you , tell him I am his fortune's vassal , and I send him The greatness he has got .
Great thing of us forgot ! , Speak , Edmund , where's the king ?
Help to bear this away where my hogshead of wine is , or I'll turn you out of my kingdom .
Methinks the ground is even .
With whom ?
All things that are , Are with more spirit chased than enjoyed .
Bear it straight , And bring thy master home immediately .
O sir , such a life with such a wife were strange !
Let four captains Bear Hamlet like a soldier to the stage , For he was likely , had he been put on , To have proved most royally .
I'll make him find him .
Yours , yours .
You lie up to the hearing of the gods .
Lay thy finger thus , and let thy soul be instructed .
Approach the chamber , and destroy your sight With a new Gorgon .
To England will I steal , and there I'll steal .
Is she not a modest young lady ?
If ever I return to you again , I'll bring you comfort .
From the dread summit of this chalky bourn .
Here's a madman will murder me .
Go charge my goblins that they grind their joints With dry convulsions , shorten up their sinews With aged cramps , and more pinch-spotted make them Than pard or cat o ' mountain .
And fixed his eyes upon you ?
Your wives , your daughters , Your matrons , and your maids could not fill up The cistern of my lust , and my desire All continent impediments would o'erbear That did oppose my will .
Let him greet England with our sharp defiance .
Name Cleopatra as she is called in Rome .
What mar you then , sir ?
You bring me out .
Why , this it is when men are ruled by women .
Do , do .
Our tongue is rough , coz , and my condition is not smooth , so that , having neither the voice nor the heart of flattery about me , I can not so conjure up the spirit of love in her that he will appear in his true likeness .
He will come straight .
Dost thou squiny at me ?
And so far blameless proves my enterprise , That I have 'nointed an Athenian's eyes .
Who's here ?
Where America , the Indies ?
Alas , good Cassio !
What , art thou ashamed of me ?
Where runn'st thou so fast ?
Why , what is that to you ?
Meet me and Gratiano At Gratiano's lodging some hour hence .
It was a vision fair and fortunate .
Why , go to then .
I must have liberty Withal , as large a charter as the wind , To blow on whom I please , for so fools have .
Let me live here ever .
Do not doubt , Cassio , But I will have my lord and you again As friendly as you were .
You speak this to fetch me in , my lord .
They are then excused , my lord , when they see not what they do .
Do you see yonder cloud that's almost in shape of a camel ?
I go .
I myself .
One word more , honest neighbors .
Then let us both be sudden .
Nothing , my lord .
Help , help , help !
But how long shall that title "ever" last ?
Tis gone .
If she should make tender of her love , 'tis very possible he'll scorn it , for the man , as you know all , hath a contemptible spirit .
O dear son Edgar , The food of thy abused father's wrath , Might I but live to see thee in my touch , I'd say I had eyes again !
Alack , 'tis he .
You taught me first to beg , and now methinks You teach me how a beggar should be answered .
And though you know my inwardness and love Is very much unto the Prince and Claudio , Yet , by mine honor , I will deal in this As secretly and justly as your soul Should with your body .
Sola , sola !
God will revenge it .
And true she is , as she hath proved herself .
Sweet masters , be patient .
The broken rancor of your high-swoll'n hates , But lately splintered , knit , and joined together , Must gently be preserved , cherished , and kept .
Now fear I this will give it start again .
I never saw the chain , so help me heaven , And this is false you burden me withal .
Give me your hand .
And now you know my meaning .
Very well , my lord .
It can not be .
Be you constant in the accusation , and my cunning shall not shame me .
Even such a husband Hast thou of me as she is for a wife .
This was well done , my bird .
For my part , I had rather bear with you than bear you .
Ay , do .
Macbeth ! , Had I three ears , I'd hear thee .
This it is : 'T is better that the enemy seek us .
Trouble him no more Till further settling .
He sends to know if your pleasure hold to play with Laertes , or that you will take longer time .
My father , poorly led ?
Peace !
Alas , then she is drowned .
O Margaret , Margaret , now thy heavy curse Is lighted on poor Hastings ' wretched head .
She is banished .
Why , so didst thou .
Indeed , that is out of the air .
Why , headstrong liberty is lashed with woe .
And let our hearts , as subtle masters do , Stir up their servants to an act of rage And after seem to chide 'em .
Whither should I fly ?
Here's the friar ready .
Let me see .
Yet that is but a crushed necessity , Since we have locks to safeguard necessaries And pretty traps to catch the petty thieves .
Well demanded , wench .
Demetrius loves her , and he loves not you .
Ere it be demanded , As like enough it will , I would have it copied .
But leave it all to God .
Now , by the world , it is a lusty wench .
Hence , away !
So in the world .
Up , my lords .
Harpier cries , "'Tis time , 'tis time." Round about the cauldron go , In the poisoned entrails throw .
Excellent well .
Yes .
Welcome home , Grumio .
Do you go back dismayed ?
He shall stay my leisure .
Draw the curtain straight .
Come , let us to the castle .
My sight was ever thick .
No , since .
Happy be Theseus , our renowned duke .
Halfway down Hangs one that gathers samphire , dreadful trade !
O excellent motion !
If there be more , more woeful , hold it in .
I would have thought her spirit had been invincible against all assaults of affection .
You , cousin .
Help to dress me , good coz , good Meg , good Ursula .
And so do I too , lieutenant .
Why , Fool ?
No , sir .
It wearies me ; you say it wearies you .

I'll ask them .
Those that do teach young babes Do it with gentle means and easy tasks .
Where's Monsieur Cobweb ?
News , friends !
The time has been That , when the brains were out , the man would die , And there an end .
Come on !
I'll in to counsel them .

No , my good lord .
Go , by this token .
When these prodigies Do so conjointly meet , let not men say , "These are their reasons .
Why , for that too .
Go take this shape And hither come in 't .
His grace hath made the match , and all grace say "Amen" to it .
Ay , my lord .
Have you done yet ?
But soft !
If you will not , come when you are next prepared for .
And let us do it with no show of fear , No , with no more than if we heard that England Were busied with a Whitsun morris-dance .
What things are these , my lord Antonio ?
Make good room .
He comes to kill my heart .
Nay , then , Well , well , th ' event .
Oh , now forever Farewell the tranquil mind !
As good a gentleman as the emperor .
What art thou ?
Ay , I praise God , and I have merited some love at his hands .
Yes , bring me word , boy , if thy lord look well , For he went sickly forth .
In happy time , Iago .
I have it here about me .
Master young man , you , I pray you , which is the way to Master Jew's ?
His nurse ?
I hid me under the dead mooncalf's gaberdine for fear of the storm .
Tis well I am found by you .
But for the stuffing , well , we are all mortal .
Nay , that's certain .
How much unlike art thou Mark Antony !
Ay , Caesar , but not gone .
The king himself is rode to view their battle .
Portia , what mean you ?
We learn no other but the confident tyrant Keeps still in Dunsinane and will endure Our setting down before 't .
Why , how now , Count , wherefore are you sad ?
Dispatch us with all speed , lest that our king Come here himself to question our delay , For he is footed in this land already .
Have you had quiet guard ?
How can these things in me seem scorn to you , Bearing the badge of faith to prove them true ?
Ay , but not yet to die !
Hero that is dead !
And let her speak of me before her father .
But he protests he loves you And needs no other suitor but his likings To take the safest occasion by the front To bring you in again .
Dost thou lie so low ?
Is Signior Lucentio within , sir ?
O , they did urge it still unto the king .
For once upon a raw and gusty day , The troubled Tiber chafing with her shores , Caesar said to me , "Darest thou , Cassius , now Leap in with me into this angry flood And swim to yonder point ? " Upon the word , Accoutred as I was , I plunged in And bade him follow .
Grim death , how foul and loathsome is thine image !
It comes upon me. , Art thou any thing ?
He were an excellent man that were made just in the midway between him and Benedick .
Lead him to my bower .
Know you where you are , sir ?
The best I can , my lord .
My husband lost his life to get the crown , And often up and down my sons were tossed For me to joy , and weep , their gain and loss .
Then make a ring about the corpse of Caesar , And let me show you him that made the will .
When this advice is free I give and honest , Probal to thinking and indeed the course To win the Moor again ?
The Marshal of France , Monsieur la Far .
Ay , Casca .
Pardon , sweet father .
I'll wait upon your Lordship .
Another hit .
His letter there Will show you his estate .
And having brought our treasure where we will , Then take we down his load and turn him off , Like to the empty ass , to shake his ears And graze in commons .
And you shall be satisfied .
To feed my humor , wish thyself no harm .
We'll away tonight , And be a day before our husbands home .
How may we try it further ?
O , the kindest Kate !
Here he comes .
Nay , that would be as great a soil in the new gloss of your marriage as to show a child his new coat and forbid him to wear it .
No doubt , my lord .
That .
A greater gift ?
Fare you well , my lord .
Welcome , my lord .
Strike the vessels , ho !
Age can not wither her , nor custom stale Her infinite variety .
I have slept , my lord , already .
How now , Grumio ?
As it ebbs , the seedsman Upon the slime and ooze scatters his grain , And shortly comes to harvest .
Spake you with him ?
At land indeed Thou dost o'ercount me of my father's house , But since the cuckoo builds not for himself , Remain in 't as thou mayst .
There are no tongues else for 's turn .
So .
What though I killed her husband and her father ?
He's gone .
But small to greater matters must give way .
I would have daffed all other respects and made her half myself .
Marry , well said , very well said .
I swear to thee , youth , by the white hand of Rosalind , I am that he , that unfortunate he .
O , that's the sword to it .
My talk to thee must be how Benedick Is sick in love with Beatrice .
I might call him A thing divine , for nothing natural I ever saw so noble .
O excellent young man !
Tis very good .
Ay , my good lord .
They say , one Taurus .
But I shall crave your pardon .
I am not what I am .
I am sorry .
That now Sweno , the Norways ' king , craves composition .
He did , from first to last .
My noble lords and cousins all , good morrow .
Alas , poor Harry of England !
I would entreat you rather to put on Your boldest suit of mirth , for we have friends That purpose merriment .
Well , I'll break in .
O , well flown , bird .
Wherefore to Dover , sir ?
The bark is ready and the wind at help , Th ' associates tend , and everything is bent For England .
Remember'st thou any that have died on 't ?
Informed them" ?
Sister , welcome .
Lord Alexas , sweet Alexas , most anything Alexas , almost most absolute Alexas , where's the soothsayer that you praised so to th' Queen ?
Hast thou , spirit , Performed to point the tempest that I bade thee ?
It stops me here , it is too much of joy .
Why , she would hang on him As if increase of appetite had grown By what it fed on , and yet , within a month , Let me not think on 't .
At Crosby Place , there shall you find us both .
O plague right well prevented !
As 'tis said , the bastard son of Gloucester .
He lies tonight within seven leagues of Rome .
No , you shall paint when you are old .
Quite dumb ?
Monster , lay to your fingers .
I would have had thee there and here again Ere I can tell thee what thou shouldst do there .
As he shall smile , Othello shall go mad .
Remember me .

Some wine , ho !
Let th' Egyptians And the Phoenicians go a-ducking .
Tis midnight .
And I have met a gentleman Hath promised me to help me to another , A fine musician to instruct our mistress .
I pray , weep not .
Will Caesar speak ?
Nor rain , wind , thunder , fire are my daughters .
Her hair , what color ?
Hot , hot , and moist .
And so will I .
And now they do re-stem Their backward course , bearing with frank appearance Their purposes toward Cyprus .
We shall ne'er be younger .
Wherefore is this ?
I should have chid you for not bringing it , But , like a shrew , you first begin to brawl .
Why the wrong is but a wrong i ' th ' world , and having the world for your labor , 'tis a wrong in your own world , and you might quickly make it right .
No .
They swore that you were almost sick for me .
The arbitrament is like to be bloody .
Post to Salisbury .
Her father loved me , oft invited me , Still questioned me the story of my life From year to year , the battles , sieges , fortunes , That I have passed .
This is his second fit .
Sweet friends , your patience for my long abode .
I know not , madam .
Who's that ?
Here , my lord .
Horn mad , thou villain !
That very time I saw ( but thou couldst not ) Flying between the cold moon and the Earth , Cupid all armed .
Vanish , or I shall give thee thy deserving , And blemish Caesar's triumph .
I once did lend my body for his wealth , Which but for him that had your husband's ring Had quite miscarried .
He calls to horse , but will I know not whither .
My husband ?
Since they did plot The means that dusky Dis my daughter got , Her and her blind boy's scandaled company I have forsworn .
And if it sort not well , you may conceal her , As best befits her wounded reputation , In some reclusive and religious life , Out of all eyes , tongues , minds , and injuries .
O , yet defend me , friends .
Let me but bind it hard , within this hour It will be well .
What are you then determined to do ?
Would it not make one weep ?
Wherefore rejoice ?
Let go !
Go to , then .
He , he , 'tis he .
I know his trumpet .
Oh , brave Iago , honest and just , That hast such noble sense of thy friend's wrong !
Is not that he that lies upon the ground ?
I must take out the work ?
Come .
None does offend , none , I say , none .
I am glad on 't .
He meant he did me none ; the more my spite .
The moon methinks looks with a watery eye .
Who is here so rude that would not be a Roman ?
I crave your highness' pardon .
I thank his Grace .
Every one .
I think it is the weakness of mine eyes That shapes this monstrous apparition .
Twas I indeed thou promised'st to strike , And thou hast given me most bitter terms .
Did not great Julius bleed for justice ' sake ?
He hath some meaning in his mad attire .
I'll court his favors .
We have none such , sir .
And doth affection breed it ?
But swords I smile at , weapons laugh to scorn , Brandished by man that's of a woman born .
A most miraculous work in this good king , Which often since my here-remain in England I have seen him do .
He attendeth here hard by To know your answer whether you'll admit him .
Here is thy fee .
His life was gentle , and the elements So mixed in him that Nature might stand up And say to all the world , "This was a man." According to his virtue let us use him , With all respect and rites of burial .
He wore his beaver up .
I never knew woman love man so .
That , being mad herself , she's madly mated .
Well , the beginning that is dead and buried .
I am to blame to be thus waited for .
No , he's in Tartar limbo , worse than hell .
That is the way to make her scorn you still .
And so am I revenged. , That would be scanned .
You mock me , sir .
Here .
Come on , sir knave , have done your foolishness , And tell me how thou hast disposed thy charge .
Send him but hither and I'll fashion him .
What stature is she of ?
Welcome , then , Thou unsubstantial air that I embrace !
Catesby , fly to the duke .
I make not , but foresee .
I can not think you are my son .
O noble judge !
But if the cause be not good , the king himself hath a heavy reckoning to make , when all those legs and arms and heads , chopped off in a battle , shall join together at the latter day , and cry all , "We died at such a place , " some swearing , some crying for a surgeon , some upon their wives left poor behind them , some upon the debts they owe , some upon their children rawly left .
I should be wise , for honesty's a fool And loses that it works for .
If he have the condition of a saint and the complexion of a devil , I had rather he should shrive me than wive me .
Zounds , sir , you're robbed !
Calls my lord ?
You have among you many a purchased slave , Which , like your asses and your dogs and mules , You use in abject and in slavish parts Because you bought them .
There's something else to do .
Not that I know .
I know it is the sun that shines so bright .
O thou good Kent , how shall I live and work To match thy goodness ?
We'll beat 'em into bench-holes .
But I beseech your Grace pardon me .
What error drives our eyes and ears amiss ?
Softly and swiftly , sir , for the priest is ready .
Give every man thy ear but few thy voice .
I Beyond all limit of what else i ' th ' world Do love , prize , honor you .
If it please His Majesty , 'tis the breathing time of day with me .
Tis a hooded valor , and when it appears , it will bate .
Oh , most lame and impotent conclusion !
Now die , die , die , die , die .
He plies the duke at morning and at night , And doth impeach the freedom of the state If they deny him justice .
Alack , what noise is this ?
And let no man abide this deed But we the doers .
Therefore , when he sees reason of fears as we do , his fears , out of doubt , be of the same relish as ours are .
His reason well I know .
We know each other's faces ; for our hearts , He knows no more of mine than I of yours , Or I of his , my lord , than you of mine. , Lord Hastings , you and he are near in love .
Down with him , thief !
Come to me , that of this I may speak more .
So please you , he is here at the door and importunes access to you .
One ever near thee .
Ask me not what I know .
I will be faithful .
That shall be by and by .
O most bloody sight !
Whip him .
Fear not , Baptista , we will content you .
Live , Brutus !
Do we but find the tyrant's power tonight , Let us be beaten if we can not fight .
O thou dull Moor !
I may do that I shall be sorry for .
Pray , write down , "Borachio." , Yours , sirrah ?
We'll mend our dinner here .
He sups tonight with a harlotry , and thither will I go to him .
He said the truth .
But are my brother's powers set forth ?
My father's love is enough to honor him .
And I am your Rosalind .
Give her this key , and tell her in the desk That's cover'd o'er with Turkish tapestry There is a purse of ducats .
Tyrant , show thy face !
They have their exits and their entrances , And one man in his time plays many parts , His acts being seven ages .
My tale provokes that question .
If I should speak , She would mock me into air .
So. , Thus then , thou most renowned : Caesar entreats Not to consider in what case thou stand'st , Further than he is Caesar .
The ox hath therefore stretched his yoke in vain , The ploughman lost his sweat , and the green corn Hath rotted ere his youth attained a beard .
Our arms in strength of malice and our hearts Of brothers ' temper do receive you in With all kind love , good thoughts , and reverence .
And I pray God grant them a fair departure .
Only I say Things have been strangely borne .
Let's tonight Be bounteous at our meal .
Why then , we are awake .
They are not ever jealous for the cause , But jealous for they're jealous .
I could find in my heart to beat him , But that the poor monster's in drink .
And the creature run from the cur ?
Octavius , lead your battle softly on , Upon the left hand of the even field .
Neither .
Villain , thou liest ; for even her very words Didst thou deliver to me on the mart .
He is my prisoner , and you shall not have him .
I confess the cape .
Good my lord , enter here .
But wherefore do you hold me here so long ?
Tomorrow shall you know our mind at full .
The watery kingdom , whose ambitious head Spits in the face of heaven , is no bar To stop the foreign spirits , but they come As o'er a brook to see fair Portia .
I will not speak with her .
Good guard Until their greater pleasures first be known That are to censure them .
Thy spirit walks abroad and turns our swords In our own proper entrails .
As sweet as balm , as soft as air , as gentle , O Antony ! , Nay , I will take thee too .
What is , my lord ?
I have an humor to knock you indifferently well .
Your Majesty , hear now , saving your Majesty's manhood , what an arrant , rascally , beggarly , lousy knave it is .
Sir , sir , sir ,
Why , how now , Adam ?
Let him appear that's come from Antony .
Why , would not you ?
For God's sake , take a house .
Is 't not strange ?
Nobody marks you .
Quick , quick !
I prithee , tell me who is it quickly , and speak apace .
My dear'st sister !
Wilt thou rest damned ?
She for an Edward weeps , and so do I ; I for a Clarence weep ; so doth not she .
Who knows the Lord Protector's mind herein ?
There is too great testimony in your complexion that it was a passion of earnest .
If they deny to come , Swinge me them soundly forth unto their husbands .
Oh , but she'll keep her word .
Thus the bowl should run , And not unluckily against the bias .
Is he not jealous ?
I owe you none till I receive the chain .
You charge me most unjustly .
Look , my lord , it comes !
In the name lay A moiety of the world .
Who knows not that ?
He'll make a proper man .
I will go lose myself And wander up and down to view the city .
Now Lord be thanked for my good amends !
Yet touch this sparingly , as 'twere far off , Because , my lord , you know my mother lives .
In cases of defense 'tis best to weigh The enemy more mighty than he seems .
The laws are mine , not thine .
Ere he take ship for France , and in Southampton .
I am that merry wanderer of the night .
Is he pursued ?
Oh , strange !
How intend you , "practiced" ?
For several virtues Have I liked several women .
For that he dares us to 't .
By this sword , I will .
Tis new to thee .
What , is this so ?
Decius , well urged .
Mark Antony , shall we give sign of battle ?
John Duke of Norfolk , Walter , Lord Ferrers , Sir Robert Brakenbury , and Sir William Brandon .
And terms compulsatory , those foresaid lands So by his father lost .
I'll cross it though it blast me. , Stay , illusion !
You shall confess that you are both deceived .
I fear it is too choleric a meat .
Hear me , Queen : The strong necessity of time commands Our services awhile , but my full heart Remains in use with you .
The ditty does remember my drowned father .
Where dwell you , pretty youth ?
Woo't weep ?
I peseech you heartily , scurvy , lousy knave , at my desires , and my requests , and my petitions , to eat , look you , this leek .
Let specialties be therefore drawn between us , That covenants may be kept on either hand .
I have seen nothing .
How say you , Signior Gremio ?
Fair lovers , you are fortunately met .
The king's a bawcock , and a heart of gold , A lad of life , an imp of fame , Of parents good , of fist most valiant .
More , Domitius : My lord desires you presently .
The sight is dismal , And our affairs from England come too late .
If thou dost love me Show me thy thought .
Now , Iras , what think'st thou ?
Oh , Oh , Oh !
You speak not as you think .
If there be any in this assembly , any dear friend of Caesar's , to him I say that Brutus ' love to Caesar was no less than his .
That I did love the Moor to live with him , My downright violence and storm of fortunes May trumpet to the world .
Show 's the way , sir .
Not with salt tears .
My lord ?
Sister , have comfort .
Why call you me "love" ?
Came they not by you ?
By heaven , I'll make a ghost of him that lets me .
Pray God , I say , I prove a needless coward !
With her , on her , what you will .
I shall win at the odds .
And Benedick is not the unhopefulest husband that I know .
Help !
That did I never hear .
All is lost !
I pray you , pass with your best violence .
I say again , give out That Anne my queen is sick and like to die .
To lend me arms and aid when I required them , The which you both denied .
Each heart in Rome does love and pity you .
The chain !
He's a traitor .
Is supper ready , the house trimmed , rushes strewed , cobwebs swept , the servingmen in their new fustian , their white stockings , and every officer his wedding garment on ?
I will be flesh and blood , For there was never yet philosopher That could endure the toothache patiently , However they have writ the style of gods And made a push at chance and sufferance .
What make you from home ?
Mercy , mercy !
And cries aloud , "Tarry , my cousin Suffolk .
Pray you sit still .
Only for this , I pray you , pardon me .
He is welcome too .
I ' faith , he'll have a lusty widow now That shall be wooed and wedded in a day .
Kill the poys and the luggage !
For I am Trinculo , be not afeard , thy good friend Trinculo .
Then 'tis like the breath of an unfee'd lawyer .
And here he stands .
This doth betoken The corse they follow did with desperate hand Fordo its own life .
What , did Caesar swoon ?
Tis better , sir , to be brief than tedious. , Let him see our commission , and talk no more .
Here do I choose , and thrive I as I may !
I am sorry that with better heed and judgment I had not quoted him .
And now , I pray you , sir , For still 'tis beating in my mind , your reason For raising this sea storm ?
Then I beat my tabor , At which , like unbacked colts , they pricked their ears , Advanced their eyelids , lifted up their noses As they smelt music .
I will unto Venice To buy apparel 'gainst the wedding day .
Most heavy day !
Why , thou peevish sheep , What ship of Epidamnum stays for me ?
I heard nothing .
So will you say when you have seen the sequel .
Cry "holla" to thy tongue , I prithee .
O Iago !
Oh , the world hath not a sweeter creature , she might lie by an emperor's side and command him tasks .
So all hail , Macbeth and Banquo !
Not he that himself is not so , which is Mark Antony .
But come , your Bergomask .
Farewell , sweet lord , and sister .
Farewell .
Marry , I fare well , For here is cheer enough .
Strike not by land ; keep whole .
They sit conferring by the parlor fire .
A damned death !
And so far am I glad it so did sort , As this their jangling I esteem a sport .
My father was no traitor .
It shall go hard if "Cambio" go without her .
There let him sink , and be the seas on him !
Come , shall we go and kill us venison ?
How long within this wood intend you stay ?
I'll devil-porter it no further .
Our time does call upon 's .
Hear me for my cause , and be silent that you may hear .
I am a gentleman of a company .
Can it be possible that no man saw them ?
No , some of it is for my child's father .
The ways are dangerous .
Do not learn of him , Emilia , though he be thy husband .
I thank you , doctor .
Is it so , countrymen ?
If , Duke of Burgundy , you would the peace , Whose want gives growth to th ' imperfections Which you have cited , you must buy that peace With full accord to all our just demands , Whose tenors and particular effects You have , enscheduled briefly , in your hands .
And yet for aught I see , they are as sick that surfeit with too much as they that starve with nothing .
Pindarus , Bid our commanders lead their charges off A little from this ground .
Wilt thou suffer them To make a rescue ?
Besides , there is no king , be his cause never so spotless , if it come to the arbitrament of swords , can try it out with all unspotted soldiers .
The duke of Exeter doth love thee well .
If this prove A vision of the Island , one dear son Shall I twice lose .
I often came where I did hear of her , but can not find her .
Lady !
Alas , gentlemen , Help , ho ! , Lieutenant , sir , Montano , Help , masters ! , Here's a goodly watch indeed !
Take but good note , and you shall see in him The triple pillar of the world transformed Into a strumpet's fool .
He'll never yield to that .
What are these faces ?
Come , shall I make you two friends ?
He would have deserved it .
No , I will go seek Some ditch wherein to die .
And did not they Put on my brows this wreath of victory And bid me give it thee ?
Oh , my pardon !
Three times today my foot-cloth horse did stumble , And started when he looked upon the Tower , As loath to bear me to the slaughterhouse .
I pray you , pardon me .
I should not urge thy duty past thy might .
I hear The strain of strutting chanticleer Cry "Cock-a-diddle-dow." Where should this music be ?
If you do love Rosalind so near the heart as your gesture cries it out , when your brother marries Aliena shall you marry her .
Murder most foul , as in the best it is .
Shut up your doors , my lord .
The worm that's fled Hath nature that in time will venom breed ; No teeth for th ' present .
Content you , gentlemen .
If he please To give me conquered Egypt for my son , He gives me so much of mine own as I Will kneel to him with thanks .
Hath an argosy cast away coming from Tripolis .
But what a fool am I to chat with you , When I should bid good morrow to my bride And seal the title with a lovely kiss !
Then show it me .
See" 't shalt thou never. , Fellows , hold the chair. , Upon these eyes of thine I'll set my foot .
So , adieu .
To which we all appeal .
Let me see your eyes .
O most false love !
Horses are tied by the heads , dogs and bears by the neck , monkeys by the loins , and men by the legs .
The crowner hath sat on her and finds it Christian burial .
Take no offense that I would not offend you .
Master , go on , and I will follow thee To the last gasp , with truth and loyalty .
I did nothing .
Let me but move one question to your daughter , And by that fatherly and kindly power That you have in her , bid her answer truly .
But where tomorrow ?
Nay , but Beatrice , Sweet Hero , she is wronged , she is slandered , she is undone .
But let me hear the letter of your friend .
Therefore heaven nature charged That one body should be filled With all graces wide-enlarged .
And thou unfit for any place but hell .
Our dinner done and he not coming thither , I went to seek him .
Shall we go seek Benedick and tell him of her love ?
My dukedom to a beggarly denier , I do mistake my person all this while !
Wilt thou not answer , man ?
But then I saw no harm , and then I heard Each syllable that breath made up between them .
Yea , the same .
You have stayed me in a happy hour .
Signior , is all your family within ?
Tell him I am prompt To lay my crown at 's feet , and there to kneel .
My wits begin to turn. , Come on , my boy .
Casca , be sudden , for we fear prevention , Brutus , what shall be done ?
Hand in hand with fairy grace Will we sing and bless this place .
Thou hast frighted the word out of his right sense , so forcible is thy wit .
Alack , sir , I am sand-blind .
Sir , in good faith , or in sincere verity , Under th ' allowance of your great aspect , Whose influence , like the wreath of radiant fire On flickering Phoebus ' front , What mean'st by this ?
O slanderous world !
Where is our usual manager of mirth ?
This is not the way To win your daughter .
The elements be kind to thee and make Thy spirits all of comfort !
All schooldays ' friendship , childhood innocence ?
My master's mind .
I durst not !
No such jade as you , if me you mean .
My lord , that would dishonor him !
I can keep honest counsel , ride , run , mar a curious tale in telling it , and deliver a plain message bluntly .
We are yet but young in deed .
Shall we their fond pageant see ?
Would all were well , but that will never be .
By heaven , it is the same I gave the doctor !
You shall play it in a mask , and you may speak as small as you will .
How are they escoted ?
Peace , ho !
With patience , noble lord , as prisoners must .
O my poor Rosalind , whither wilt thou go ?
Here is a rural fellow That will not be denied your Highness' presence .
Be not you ashamed to show , he'll not shame to tell you what it means .
I say thou hast belied mine innocent child .
You have not been abed , then ?
Our son shall win .
Repent that e'er thy tongue Hath so betrayed thine act .
I do believe 'twas he .
The soldier's pole is fall'n !
No more of that .
A grievous fault. , Say , woman , didst thou so ?
I do believe that these applauses are For some new honors that are heaped on Caesar .
No , Antony , take the lot .
She soon shall know of us , by some of ours , How honorable and how kindly we Determine for her , for Caesar can not live To be ungentle .
I never gave him token .
Liberty !
The worm of conscience still begnaw thy soul .
Behold and see .
What would my lord ?
Sure , I think so , And therefore certainly it were not good She knew his love , lest she make sport at it .
God give your Grace good rest .
The gates of mercy shall be all shut up , And the fleshed soldier , rough and hard of heart , In liberty of bloody hand , shall range With conscience wide as hell , mowing like grass Your fresh fair virgins and your flow'ring infants .
As far , my lord , as will fill up the time 'Twixt this and supper .
There is one goat for you .
The old cock .
Is 't far you ride ?
What if my house be troubled with a rat And I be pleased to give ten thousand ducats To have it baned ?
So he laughed and let me go .
Mine ear , I thank it , brought me to thy sound But why unkindly didst thou leave me so ?
Such unconstant starts are we like to have from him as this of Kent's banishment .
How goes 't ?
Nay , I will give thee a kiss .
Come let's in all .
What news among the merchants ?
Come , you deceive yourself .
My lord , you know I love you .
It is , my lord .
But if we fail , We then can do 't at land .
Tis passing good .
Cleopatra , Not what you have reserved nor what acknowledged Put we i' th' roll of conquest .
Come hither , fellow .
The gods forbid !
Why dost thou ask ?
Speak softly .
Let's all sink wi ' th ' king .
Hold off the earth awhile Till I have caught her once more in mine arms .
Now , Charmian !
Exchange forgiveness with me , noble Hamlet .
Mine honor was not yielded , But conquered merely .
He may recover yet .
Cousin , thou wast not wont to be so dull .
What is thy news then ?
Where is Metellus Cimber ?
Ah , but I think him better than I say , And yet would herein others ' eyes were worse .
For my part , I have walked about the streets , Submitting me unto the perilous night , And , thus unbraced , Casca , as you see , Have bared my bosom to the thunder-stone .
We looked not for Mark Antony here .
Hear me yet , good Shylock .
Coming from Sardis , on our former ensign Two mighty eagles fell , and there they perched , Gorging and feeding from our soldiers ' hands , Who to Philippi here consorted us .
We are enough yet living in the field To smother up the English in our throngs , If any order might be thought upon .
I will tomorrow , And betimes I will , to the weird sisters .
Fly , good Fleance , fly , fly , fly !
What he hath lost , noble Macbeth hath won .
Think yourself a baby That you have ta'en these tenders for true pay , Which are not sterling .
Brother , good night .
Hey , Mountain , hey !
Nor hath Love's mind of any judgment taste , Wings and no eyes figure unheedy haste .
Where is Lysander and fair Hermia ?
Caesar , thou canst not die by traitors ' hands Unless thou bring'st them with thee .
Then every soldier kill his prisoners .
I will possess you of that ship and treasure .
If we know him to be a thief , shall we not lay hands on him ?
He thinks , being twenty times of better fortune , He is twenty men to one .
Villain , not for thy life !
Rarely , rarely .
A fine woman !
Harder , harder .
How sweet the moonlight sleeps upon this bank !
If this uncouth forest yield anything savage , I will either be food for it or bring it for food to thee .
Go , go , good countrymen , and for this fault , Assemble all the poor men of your sort , Draw them to Tiber banks , and weep your tears Into the channel till the lowest stream Do kiss the most exalted shores of all .
Away , get thee away .
The children thus disposed , my wife and I , Fixing our eyes on whom our care was fixed , Fastened ourselves at either end the mast And , floating straight , obedient to the stream , Was carried towards Corinth , as we thought .
Holds it true , sir , that the Duke of Cornwall was so slain ?
The noblest deer hath them as huge as the rascal .
Burn but his books .
Edmund , seek him out , wind me into him , I pray you .
The third part , then , is drunk .
But , good Kate , mock me mercifully , the rather , gentle princess , because I love thee cruelly .
Ha !
How , in one house , Should many people under two commands Hold amity ?
Here comes my man .
Men , wives , and children stare , cry out , and run As it were doomsday .
If we do meet again , why , we shall smile .
Tis a blushing , shamefaced spirit that mutinies in a man's bosom .
Roderigo !
Tell me for more certainty , Albeit I'll swear that I do know your tongue .
They swore you did .
Dear master , I can go no further .
Make you a wholesome answer .
Our force by land Hath nobly held .
How many , as you guess ?
Come not in here , nuncle .
I fear your disposition .
And therefore , since I can not prove a lover To entertain these fair well-spoken days , I am determined to prove a villain And hate the idle pleasures of these days .
I was sure your lordship did not give it me .
Relent , and save your souls .
I'll bring you to him straight .
O bear me witness , night , What man is this ?
Remember First to possess his books , for without them He's but a sot , as I am , nor hath not One spirit to command .
Let me come to her .
Yea , but you must not make the full show of this till you may do it without controlment .
Let that appear hereafter , and aim better at me by that I now will manifest .
I know not , madam .
Put on what weary negligence you please , You and your fellow servants .
Who hath sent thee now ?
I am quickly ill , and well , So Antony loves .
If I have killed the issue of your womb , To quicken your increase I will beget Mine issue of your blood upon your daughter .
Give me your present to one Master Bassanio , who indeed gives rare new liveries .
Something he left imperfect in the state which , since his coming forth , is thought of ; which imports to the kingdom so much fear and danger that his personal return was most required and necessary .
I speak not yet of proof .
Go to the gate .
Sir , this is the matter , I beseech you , remember , Nay , good my lord , for mine ease , in good faith .
Farewell , kind master .
Yea , dost thou jeer and flout me in the teeth ?
If our father would sleep till I waked him , you should enjoy half his revenue forever , and live the beloved of your brother , Edgar." Hum , conspiracy ?
Look where it comes again !
I'll be at thy elbow .
Has he never before sounded you in this business ?
Long since thy husband served me in my wars , And I to thee engaged a prince's word , When thou didst make him master of thy bed , To do him all the grace and good I could .
Madam ?
So say I. Methinks you are sadder .
When I come where he calls , then he is gone .
What will you do ?
Pronounce it for me , sir , to all our friends , For my heart speaks they are welcome .
You may , sir .
thieves !
All lost !
I think 'twas Soto that your Honor means .
Now , Signior Petruchio , how speed you with my daughter ?
Miserable England , I prophesy the fearfull'st time to thee That ever wretched age hath looked upon. , Come , lead me to the block .
The weakest kind of fruit Drops earliest to the ground , and so let me .
Woe , woe are we , sir , you may not live to wear All your true followers out .
Marry , sir , we say we are none .
Now boast thee , Death , in thy possession lies A lass unparalleled .
Ay , but the mustard is too hot a little .
And from hence I go To make these doubts all even .
They were villains , murderers .
And so , adieu .
By the eighth hour .
And yet it is danger To make him even o'er the time he has lost .
Good my lord , give me thy favor still .
Thus Rosalind of many parts By heavenly synod was devised , Of many faces , eyes , and hearts To have the touches dearest prized .
What , so brief ?
Cleopatra Hath nodded him to her .
Gives him three thousand crowns in annual fee And his commission to employ those soldiers , So levied as before , against the Polack , With an entreaty , herein further shown , That it might please you to give quiet pass Through your dominions for this enterprise , On such regards of safety and allowance As therein are set down .
Besides , they all are fresh .
What cheer ?
I go .
How came we ashore ?
Let Lucius and Titinius guard our door .
But for my daughter Katherine , this I know , She is not for your turn , the more my grief .
I will play the swan .
I pray you , let it stand .
Where is thy leather apron and thy rule ?
I came hither to tell you ; and , circumstances shortened , for she has been too long a-talking of , the lady is disloyal .
I mean that my heart unto yours is knit So that but one heart we can make of it .
You have some cause ; they have not .
Ill luck , ill luck ?
The soul and body rive not more in parting Than greatness going off .
And squabble ?
Marry , if he that writ it had played Pyramus and hanged himself in Thisbe's garter , it would have been a fine tragedy .
No , pray thee .
Was this fair paper , this most goodly book , Made to write "whore" upon ?
I am afeard there are few die well that die in a battle , for how can they charitably dispose of anything , when blood is their argument ?
How now , cousin Hero !
Were I a common laugher , or did use To stale with ordinary oaths my love To every new protester , if you know That I do fawn on men and hug them hard And , after , scandal them , or if you know That I profess myself in banqueting To all the rout , then hold me dangerous .
Who brought it ?
Bloody constraint , for if you hide the crown Even in your hearts , there will he rake for it .
I do assure thee , father , so it is .
Speak yet .
Why , one that swears and lies .
What , was I married to her in my dream ?
If thou say so , withdraw and prove it too .
Hang up thy mistress !
And fair she is , if that mine eyes be true .
Thy asses are gone about 'em .
What's the matter , think you ?
Downy windows , close ,
Seek , seek for him , Lest his ungoverned rage dissolve the life That wants the means to lead it .
Nay , if they lead to any ill , I will leave them at the next turning .
The Count is neither sad , nor sick , nor merry , nor well , but civil count , civil as an orange , and something of that jealous complexion .
Very easily possible .
If thou canst love a fellow of this temper , Kate , whose face is not worth sunburning , that never looks in his glass for love of anything he sees there , let thine eye be thy cook .
Your brother Gloucester hates you .
Good counsel , marry .
These griefs and losses have so bated me , That I shall hardly spare a pound of flesh Tomorrow to my bloody creditor. , Well , jailer , on. , Pray God Bassanio come To see me pay his debt , and then I care not .
Where hast thou been , sister ?
Would Katherine had never seen him , though !
I am no child , no babe .
In the meantime I will draw a bill of properties such as our play wants .
Hence !
Fear not my government .
I stand for judgment .
Dost thou not suspect my place ?
With his mouth full of news .
Tom's a-cold .
Good people , enter and lay hold on him .
I thought thy heart had been wounded with the claws of a lion .
What do you see ?
But yet hie you to Egypt again .
Hover about her ; say that right for right Hath dimmed your infant morn to aged night .
More villain thou. , Well , push him out of doors And let my officers of such a nature Make an extent upon his house and lands .
For shame , put on your gown .
What , thou meanest an officer ?
The dew is raw and cold .
Upon record , my gracious lord .
Faith , stay here this night .
You are welcome .
I have done ill , Of which I do accuse myself so sorely That I will joy no more .
An you lie , sirrah , we'll have you whipped .
Is not this true ?
She replied It should be better he became her guest , Which she entreated .
Here is better than the open air .
What , with my tongue in your tail ?
I knew it would be your answer .
He would not ?
A dear happiness to women .
Question it , Horatio .
And we'll consign thereto. , Will you , fair sister , Go with the princes or stay here with us ?
I tell him we shall stay here at the least a month , and he heartily prays some occasion may detain us longer .
Night hangs upon mine eyes .
The best and soundest of his time hath been but rash .
Be gone !
Wast ever in court , shepherd ?
To threaten me with death is most unlawful .
Good Corporal Nym , show thy valor and put up your sword .
I had rather be a canker in a hedge than a rose in his grace , and it better fits my blood to be disdained of all than to fashion a carriage to rob love from any .
How now , brother Edmund ?
I can not hide what I am .
Thou art a villain !
Then let your servants bring my husband forth .
I will seek him , sir , presently , convey the business as I shall find means , and acquaint you withal .
Macbeth doth come .
She has light by her continually .
How , in stripping it , You more invest it !
I pray you leave me .
Thou shouldst know There were a heart in Egypt .
You know he does .
Ay , marry , is 't .
Who's there , besides foul weather ?
She died , my lord , but whiles her slander lived .
An he should , it were an alms to hang him .
Thither must I , and here I leave you , sir .
Come on , come on .
An please your Worship , Brakenbury , You may partake of anything we say .
No marrying 'mong his subjects ?
I know the glove is a glove .
If it be man's work , I'll do 't .
It must needs be of subtle , tender , and delicate temperance .
Demetrius thinks not so .
We'll leave you , Brutus .
Not a jot more , my lord .
There , drink that for me .
Everything is well .
Is he dead ?
If you do fight against your country's foes , Your country's fat shall pay your pains the hire .
With the earl , sir , here within .
I feared he did but trifle And meant to wreck thee .
Marcus Octavius , Marcus Justeius , Publicola , and Caelius , are for sea ; But we keep whole by land .
I think he thinks upon the savage bull .
I will withdraw To furnish me with some swift means of death For the fair devil .
Now is it Rome indeed , and room enough , When there is in it but one only man .
Well praised !
If he do , sure he can not weep 't back again .
To make an account of her life to a clod of wayward marl ?
If you will come to me , For now I spy a danger , I entreat you To bring but five and twenty .
O , would to God that the inclusive verge Of golden metal that must round my brow Were red-hot steel to sear me to the brains !
Thy husband .
Madam , O good Empress !
Who's there ?
Made you my guardians , my depositaries , But kept a reservation to be followed With such a number .
Yet words do well When he that speaks them pleases those that hear .
We will be married o ' Sunday .
She swoons to see them bleed .
Be lion-mettled , proud , and take no care Who chafes , who frets , or where conspirers are .
Well , but to my choice .
How can that be , unless she drowned herself in her own defense ?
Good my liege , Peace , Kent .
No more words .
Have you a soul or sense ?
He's a friend of the Duke Alencon's .
Who is 't that hinders you ?
Your heart's desires be with you .
The greatest note of it is his melancholy .
If you do sweat to put a tyrant down , You sleep in peace , the tyrant being slain .
O Thou , whose captain I account myself , Look on my forces with a gracious eye .
O most unhappy day !
Ink and paper , Charmian .
Villain , thou didst deny the gold's receipt And told'st me of a mistress and a dinner , For which , I hope , thou felt'st I was displeased .
I am sorry thou wilt leave my father so .
You will be schoolmaster And undertake the teaching of the maid : That's your device .
What a strange drowsiness possesses them !
And Cassius too .
My gracious sovereign , now in Devonshire , As I by friends am well advertised , Sir Edward Courtney and the haughty prelate , Bishop of Exeter , his elder brother , With many more confederates are in arms .
If God will be avenged for this deed , O , know you yet He doth it publicly !
Let your wedding be tomorrow .
And let my liver rather heat with wine Than my heart cool with mortifying groans .
Your Majesty shall mock at me .
And what said he ?
Where remains he ?
In each thing give him way .
Good my lord , How does your honor for this many a day ?
My fault , but not my body , pardon , sovereign .
And fair words to them .
Something , sure , of state , Either from Venice , or some unhatched practice Made demonstrable here in Cyprus to him , Hath puddled his clear spirit , and in such cases Men's natures wrangle with inferior things , Though great ones are their object .
Where is the gold I gave in charge to thee ?
Oh , 'twas a din to fright a monster's ear , To make an earthquake !
Wear both of them , for both of them are thine .
This speed of Caesar's Carries beyond belief .
Swallows have built In Cleopatra's sails their nests .
Your wife Octavia , with her modest eyes And still conclusion , shall acquire no honor Demuring upon me .
He would not have spoke such a word .
Go , call him hither , boy No more shall be the neighbor to my counsels Hath he so long held out with me , untired , And stops he now for breath ?
Assist , good friends .
Quiet thy cudgel .
Therefore , since brevity is the soul of wit And tediousness the limbs and outward flourishes , I will be brief : your noble son is mad .
Twere damnation To think so base a thought .
If she deny to wed , I'll crave the day When I shall ask the banns and when be married .
O , let him pass .
What , An advocate for an imposter ?
And I'll be wise hereafter And seek for grace .
It was divided Between her heart and lips .
But I will tell you at some meeter season .
Why , there , there , there , there !
A surgeon !
As well as I can , madam .
I know not , Menas , How lesser enmities may give way to greater .
What "quality" ?
Talk you of young Master Launcelot ?
This is a man , old , wrinkled , faded , withered , And not a maiden , as thou say'st he is .
Come hither , you rogue !
O vassal !
Alack , for pity !
An oath , an oath , I have an oath in heaven .
Oh , horrible , oh , horrible , most horrible !
It is just so high as it is , and moves with its own organs .
What I should deny , As this I would , ay , though thou didst produce My very character , I'd turn it all To thy suggestion , plot , and damned practice .
Why , that he did , I know not what he did .
God be with you .
If I could add a lie unto a fault I would deny it .
O , no !
Briefly , sir .
Be not so hasty to confound my meaning .
He hath honored me of late , and I have bought Golden opinions from all sorts of people , Which would be worn now in their newest gloss , Not cast aside so soon .
O , my old master. , Who hath bound him here ?
Caesar , and that , having in Sicily Sextus Pompeius spoiled , we had not rated him His part o' th' isle .
I'll have this crown of mine cut from my shoulders Before I'll see the crown so foul misplaced .
Oh , that's well said , the chair !
Tis dangerous when the baser nature comes Between the pass and fell incensed points Of mighty opposites .
We are for you .
I had rather have this tongue cut from my mouth Than it should do offence to Michael Cassio .
What , are the brothers parted ?
What touches us ourself shall be last served .
Bring me to Antony .
And this report Hath so exasperated the king that he Prepares for some attempt of war .
Therefore prepare thee to cut off the flesh .
Is there not charms By which the property of youth and maidhood May be abused ?
You'll let us in , I hope ?
Nothing , madam .
Is it not past two o'clock ?
While grace is saying , hood mine eyes Thus with my hat , and sigh and say , "Amen" , Use all the observance of civility Like one well studied in a sad ostent To please his grandam , never trust me more .
Where be the sacred vials thou shouldst fill With sorrowful water ?
But I am much to blame .
Why so earnestly seek you to put up that letter ?
I pray you , know me when we meet again .
Monsieur the challenger , the Princess calls for you .
Come , Dromio , come , these jests are out of season .
Oh , heavy ignorance !
You may as well do anything most hard , As seek to soften that , than which what's harder ? , His Jewish heart .
In faith , he's penitent , And yet his trespass , in our common reason ( Save that , they say , the wars must make example Out of her best ) is not , almost , a fault T ' incur a private check .
And find I am alone felicitate In your dear highness ' love .
Be bloody , bold , and resolute .
Oh , villainous !
Will you give her o'er ?
Come , I will bring thee to thy bridal chamber .
Ha , ha !
Tis safer to be that which we destroy Than by destruction dwell in doubtful joy .
Farewell , thou lob of spirits .
Therein , ye gods , you tyrants do defeat .
If ever he have wife , let her be made More miserable by the death of him Than I am made by my poor lord and thee. , Come now towards Chertsey with your holy load , Taken from Paul's to be interred there .
My love , my life , my soul , fair Helena !
You shall have anything .
Marry , thou dost wrong me , thou dissembler , thou .
Such a one is a natural philosopher .
So , again , good night .
But why , why , why ?
He is ready at the door .
Is she so hot a shrew as she's reported ?
Why then , your uncle and the Prince and Claudio Have been deceived .
No , hath not ?
It is not friendly , 'tis not maidenly .
Of whence , I pray ?
Poor heart , adieu .
On a trice , so please you , Even in a dream were we divided from them And were brought moping hither .
Or shall I think in silver she's immured , Being ten times undervalued to tried gold ?
What man is that ?
What's the matter , lieutenant ?
Say , have I thy consent that they shall die ?
And yet I do thee wrong to mind thee of it , For thou art framed of the firm truth of valor .
Not being the worst Stands in some rank of praise .
How do you , madam ?
Are you our daughter ?
Go , sirrah , seek him .
Listen but speak not to 't .
I have been up this hour , awake all night .
And what's the news , good cousin Lodovico ?
How fares my noble lord ?
Farewell , thou woeful welcomer of glory .
Oh , I am slain !
What should I do I do not ?
And we will hear it .
All three of them are desperate .
Indeed , indeed , sirs , but this troubles me .
Iago , who began 't ?
I have seen thee fight When I have envied thy behavior .
Excellent .
She shall , Lucentio .
What is 't you do ?
Fouler than heart can think thee , thou canst make No excuse current but to hang thyself .
And , for his passage , The soldiers ' music and the rites of war Speak loudly for him .
Therefore I have entreated him along With us to watch the minutes of this night , That if again this apparition come He may approve our eyes and speak to it .
By what rule , sir ?
Shall , Antipholus , Even in the spring of love thy love-springs rot ?
Oh , that woman that can not make her fault her husband's occasion , let her never nurse her child herself , for she will breed it like a fool .
Here I am .
Oh , a good wish upon you .
I will be satisfied .
Urge the necessity and state of times , And be not peevish found in great designs .
My good lord .
I have told him , Lepidus was grown too cruel , That he his high authority abused And did deserve his change .
Thou hast some suit to Caesar , hast thou not ?
That thing you speak of , I took it for a man .
By Jupiter , Were I the wearer of Antonio's beard , I would not shave 't today .
His name , my lord , is Tyrrel .
Phoebe did write it .
I afeard of him !
Now we speak upon our cue , and our voice is imperial .
His glory not extenuated wherein he was worthy , nor his offenses enforced for which he suffered death .
I do not know .
This prince hath neither claimed it nor deserved it And therefore , in mine opinion , can not have it .
And let him hold his fingers thus , and through that cranny shall Pyramus and Thisbe whisper .
Let her live To join our kingdoms and our hearts , and never Fly off our loves again !
And must they all be hanged that swear and lie ?
You , constable , are to present the Prince's own person .
I am satisfied .
Ay , madam .
That he hath used thee .
There's money for thee .
My Lord of Oxford , you , Sir William Brandon , And you , Sir Walter Herbert , stay with me .
I'll set a bourn how far to be beloved .
Yet have I left a daughter .
No more than my residing here at Rome Might be to you in Egypt .
Now , soldiers , march away , And how Thou pleasest , God , dispose the day .
Three thousand ducats for three months , and Antonio bound .
So good night unto you all .
I could be well moved if I were as you .
You embrace your charge too willingly .
Yet hear me speak .
Come , one for me .
Most certain , sir .
If it were so , it was a grievous fault , And grievously hath Caesar answered it .
And unrespective boys .
I know not what to say .
Hail , King of Scotland !
Look where they come .
The heart is sorely charged .
Dorset , embrace him. , Hastings , love Lord Marquess .
To me it is a prison .
Dear Celia , I show more mirth than I am mistress of , and would you yet I were merrier ?
Of Albany's and Cornwall's powers you heard not ?
Now let me see if I can conster it .
A trade , sir , that I hope I may use with a safe conscience , which is , indeed , sir , a mender of bad soles .
O , teach me how you look and with what art You sway the motion of Demetrius ' heart .
A sleeve ?
Your loss is as yourself , great , and you bear it As answering to the weight .
Amen .
I have sent to bid Cassio come speak with you .
Where art thou now ?
His folly , Helena , is no fault of mine .
We three are married , but you two are sped .
I would these dewy tears were from the ground .
Come , boy .
It is meat and drink to me to see a clown .
If I can recover him and keep him tame , I will not take too much for him .
This bond doth give thee here no jot of blood .
If this were true , then should I know this secret .
But that you do not love me .
Nor heaven nor earth have been at peace tonight .
You see how simple and how fond I am .
You see me here , you gods , a poor old man , As full of grief as age , wretched in both .
Kill me tomorrow , let me live tonight !
I had a son , Now outlawed from my blood .
Is 't frailty that thus errs ?
It is a reeling world indeed , my lord , And I believe will never stand upright Till Richard wear the garland of the realm .
Tis true .
Thou art a villain to impeach me thus .
No , unpin me here .
I will expect you .
The honor is sacred which he talks on now , Supposing that I lacked it. , But , on , Caesar .
Weapons , arms ?
When I presented Ceres , I thought to have told thee of it , but I feared Lest I might anger thee .
Who shall stay you ?
Here lies the east .
By the apostle Paul , shadows tonight Have struck more terror to the soul of Richard Than can the substance of ten thousand soldiers Armed in proof and led by shallow Richmond .
Begone !
It is the most impenetrable cur That ever kept with men .
Ay , past all surgery .
Hazard for lead ?
It is a tale Told by an idiot , full of sound and fury , Signifying nothing .
Think on Lord Hastings .
Titinius ' face is upward .
Ay , or very falsely pocket up his report .
I'll not be made a soft and dull-eyed fool To shake the head , relent and sigh , and yield To Christian intercessors .
Why should she write to Edmund ?
Canst thou , when thou command'st the beggar's knee , Command the health of it ?
Sit you too .
I am in this commanded to deliver The noble duke of Clarence to your hands .
What I can do I will , and more I will Than for myself I dare .
Thy slander hath gone through and through her heart , And she lies buried with her ancestors , Oh , in a tomb where never scandal slept Save this of hers , framed by thy villainy .
No .
For a fish without a fin , there's a fowl without a feather. , Go , get thee gone .
I'll to my book , For yet ere supper-time must I perform Much business appertaining .
Go , and bring them .
I know 't , my sister's .
Peace then !
Come , bid me do anything for thee .
What , must I come to you With five and twenty , Regan ?
And when I rear my hand , do you the like , To fall it on Gonzalo .
Sir , I shall study deserving .
What a foolish duty call you this ?
I know you of old .
Now , unto thy bones good night !
If by your art , my dearest father , you have Put the wild waters in this roar , allay them .
Take heed of Cassius .
I prithee , let thy wife attend on her , And bring them after in the best advantage .
What ?
For them all together , which maintained so politic a state of evil that they will not admit any good part to intermingle with them .
But though thou art adjudged to the death , And passed sentence may not be recalled But to our honour's great disparagement , Yet will I favor thee in what I can .
But it is no matter .
I here take my oath before this honorable assembly , she kicked the poor king her father .
It is not for you .
These fifteen years you have been in a dream Or , when you waked , so waked as if you slept .
And sometime lurk I in a gossip's bowl In very likeness of a roasted crab , And when she drinks , against her lips I bob And on her withered dewlap pour the ale .
If you shall cleave to my consent , when 'tis , It shall make honor for you .
The usurer hangs the cozener .
Soft !
Now I perceive they have conjoined all three To fashion this false sport , in spite of me. , Injurious Hermia !
Good Lord !
A touch , a touch , I do confess 't .
It much would please him That of his fortunes you should make a staff To lean upon .
Now he importunes him To tell it o'er .
We will speak further .
What's that good for ?
What were these ?
Alexas !
Go in with me .
Let us be conjunctive in our revenge against him .
Tis figured in my tongue .
I did , my lord .
She is indeed perfection .
You come with letters against the king and take Vanity the puppet's part against the royalty of her father .
Therefore should every soldier in the wars do as every sick man in his bed : wash every mote out of his conscience .
Come , go in .
It may be , very like .
I dare make his answer , none .
Ay , my good lord .
Abhor it , fear it , do not enter it .
Good sir , be patient .
Your Emperor Continues still a Jove .
And here's a marvelous convenient place for our rehearsal .
Nay , I prithee stay a little .
Aboard , aboard , for shame !
Keep me in temper .
If I can recover him and keep him tame and get to Naples with him , he's a present for any emperor that ever trod on neat's leather .
Tis clean out of the way .
No , my lord .
Bless thee from whirlwinds , star-blasting , and taking !
I will set down what comes from her , to satisfy my remembrance the more strongly .
I hear him .
Have I not heard the sea , puffed up with winds , Rage like an angry boar chafed with sweat ?
Let me hire him too. , Here's my coxcomb .
Then if we lose this battle You are contented to be led in triumph Thorough the streets of Rome ?
Saving your merry humor , here's the note How much your chain weighs to the utmost carat , The fineness of the gold , and chargeful fashion , Which doth amount to three-odd ducats more Than I stand debted to this gentleman .
How now , you dog ?
Fare you well .
It was my turquoise .
Tis for the dead , not for the quick .
O , for my beads !
That we should , with joy , pleasance revel and applause , transform ourselves into beasts !
No , it begins again .
What's he ?
Fire !
He received them Of him that brought them .
Now , my Lord Constable ?
To what base uses we may return , Horatio .
In the street I met him , And in his company that gentleman .
Do so .
No more .
The mind I sway by and the heart I bear Shall never sag with doubt nor shake with fear .
It is the blessed sun .
Fly , fly , my lord .
Go but with me tonight , you shall see her chamber window entered , even the night before her wedding day .
I should have known no less .
He will not say so .
Ere I ope his letter , I pray you tell me how my good friend doth .
Our good old friend , Lay comforts to your bosom , and bestow Your needful counsel to our business , Which craves the instant use .
No , my lord , I saw nothing .
Let go , slave , or thou diest !
But if that I am I , then well I know Your weeping sister is no wife of mine , Nor to her bed no homage do I owe .
I have been talking with a suitor here , A man that languishes in your displeasure .
Well , I will call Beatrice to you , who I think hath legs .
And thought they Margaret was Hero ?
Welcome , Signior .
Fly , my lord , fly .
Thee and thy virtues here I seize upon , Be it lawful I take up what's cast away .
And I know , my lord , If law , authority , and power deny not , It will go hard with poor Antonio .
The Moor himself at sea And is in full commission here for Cyprus .
Some food we had and some fresh water that A noble Neapolitan , Gonzalo , Out of his charity , who being then appointed Master of this design , did give us , with Rich garments , linens , stuffs , and necessaries , Which since have steaded much .
Master young gentleman , I pray you , which is the way to Master Jew's ?
Early tomorrow will we rise and hence .
What said Northumberland as touching Richmond ?
The king comes here tonight .
Thou shouldst rather ask if it were possible any villainy should be so rich .
Good sir ,
Tis time we twain Did show ourselves i' th' field , and to that end Assemble we immediate council .
Fellows , let's be gone .
The gods defend him from so great a shame !
I met this man with my glove in his cap , and I have been as good as my word .
Nay , come again , Good Kate .
How does my good Lord Hamlet ?
Thus I let you go And give you to the gods .
Let the old ruffian know I have many other ways to die , meantime Laugh at his challenge .
Is it possible that any villainy should be so dear ?
What is the matter there ?
Was he not born of woman ?
I warrant you , madam .
Do not lie so near .
Have patience and endure .
Tis exactly valued , Not petty things admitted .
Think you to walk forth ?
It pleases your Worship to say so , but we are the poor duke's officers .
My letters say a hundred and seven galleys .
Ay , or drinking , fencing , swearing , Quarreling , drabbing , you may go so far .
Tut , a toy !
Rosalind is your love's name ?
Sir , have pity , I'll be his surety .
Bid that welcome Which comes to punish us , and we punish it , Seeming to bear it lightly .
Wilt break my heart ?
Now in respect it is in the fields , it pleaseth me well ; but in respect it is not in the court , it is tedious .
Doth not Brutus bootless kneel ?
Why , but there's many a man hath more hair than wit .
They stand and would have parley .
There , take it , Prince .
This is a most majestic vision , and Harmonious charmingly .
Die when thou hast lived .
These injuries the king now bears will be revenged home .
O most unhappy strumpet !
He's speaking now , Or murmuring "Where's my serpent of old Nile ? " For so he calls me .
I think that one of them is hereabout , And can not make away .
Lord , let me never have a cause to sigh , Till I be brought to such a silly pass !
The English force , so please you .
Then take him up and manage well the jest .
The king rises .
In your bad strokes , Brutus , you give good words .
A quarrel , but nothing wherefore .
Thou liest .
Why , your lieutenant , Cassio .
I can not draw a cart , nor eat dried oats .
I will go seek the king .
And what's to come of my despised time Is naught but bitterness .
This will prove a brave kingdom to me , where I shall have my music for nothing .
Better be with the dead , Whom we , to gain our peace , have sent to peace , Than on the torture of the mind to lie In restless ecstasy .
Mine ear must pluck it thence .
And this our life , exempt from public haunt , Finds tongues in trees , books in the running brooks , Sermons in stones , and good in everything .
That methinks is strange .
He's dead .
But here my father comes .
Dolabella !
That you have wronged me doth appear in this : You have condemned and noted Lucius Pella For taking bribes here of the Sardians , Wherein my letters , praying on his side Because I knew the man , were slighted off .
All things are ready if our minds be so .
One heart , one bed , two bosoms , and one troth .
Good night .
Be happy .
Gifts that God gives .
Think not I love him , though I ask for him .
Madam wife , they say that I have dreamed And slept above some fifteen year or more .
Sir , I lack advancement .
When it is paid , bring your true friend along .
Tear him to pieces .
Rub him about the temples .
Me , uncle ?
About the wood go swifter than the wind , And Helena of Athens look thou find , All fancy-sick she is and pale of cheer , With sighs of love , that costs the fresh blood dear .
What , in the midst of the street ?
Proceed , Moon .
Now , Eros .
Thou canst tell why one's nose stands i ' th ' middle on 's face ?
Sooth , madam , I hear nothing .
That's fouler .
He has deserved it , were it carbuncled Like holy Phoebus' car .
All which the Moor is defective in .

Who are they ?
But we are prevented .
I can write very like my lady your niece : on a forgotten matter we can hardly make distinction of our hands .
Do thy office .
If this fall into thy hand , revolve .
Wherefore are these things hid ?
They say he has been fencer to the Sophy .
You do mistake me , sir .
About your years , my lord .
A coward , a most devout coward , religious in it .
Like aqua vitae with a midwife .
What are you ?
Then you are mad indeed , if you be no better in your wits than a fool .
It may be worth thy pains , for I can sing And speak to him in many sorts of music That will allow me very worth his service .
Challenge me the count's youth to fight with him .
Go look after him .
Let him be the devil , an he will , I care not .
It is perchance that you yourself were saved .
Madam , there is at the gate a young gentleman much desires to speak with you .
Hold , sir , here's my purse .
The house will be the quieter .
I tell thee , I am as well in my wits as any man in Illyria .
There lies your way , due west .
I would we were well rid of this knavery .
Fie , thou dishonest Satan !
Sir Topas !
Look where the youngest wren of nine comes .
Antonio never yet was thief or pirate , Though , I confess , on base and ground enough , Orsino's enemy .
An your ladyship will have it as it ought to be , you must allow Prithee , read i ' thy right wits .
I do assure you , 'tis against my will .
I am no fighter .
How dost thou , my good fellow ?
Good , good .
A blank , my lord .
Who you are and what you would are out of my welkin , I might say "element , " but the word is overworn .
Let him send no more , Unless perchance you come to me again To tell me how he takes it .
What news from her ?
If it will not , what remedy ?
To the Elephant .
Most certain .
Do not desire to see this letter .
Pray you , sir , do you know of this matter ?
Thou shalt not choose but go .
I will answer you with gait and entrance .
This is the air , that is the glorious sun .
What shall we do else ?
Fare thee well .
I mean , she is the list of my voyage .
Away with him !
If it be thus to dream , still let me sleep !
If you offend him , I for him defy you .
Madam , I come to whet your gentle thoughts On his behalf .
By this hand , they are scoundrels and substractors that say so of him .
Where is Malvolio ?
Ay , sir , we are some of her trappings .
I told him you were asleep .
Virtue is beauty , but the beauteous evil Are empty trunks o'erflourished by the devil .
He is very well-favored , and he speaks very shrewishly .
Sir , no .
I think oxen and wainropes can not hale them together .
The gentleman will , for his honor's sake , have one bout with you .
O , welcome , father !
And wished to see thee cross-gartered." Cross-gartered ?
A good note , that keeps you from the blow of the law .
Is 't so saucy ?
How now , mistress ?
I'll ride home tomorrow , Sir Toby .
I will prove it legitimate , sir , upon the oaths of judgment and reason .
Did you never see the picture of "We Three" ?
What might you think ?
He named Sebastian .
Be curst and brief .
How now , gentleman ?
I will do everything that thou wilt have me .
Here is yet a postscript .
Alas , sir , be patient .
I'll ride your horse as well as I ride you .
Sir Topas , Sir Topas , good Sir Topas , go to my lady , Out , hyperbolical fiend !
Not yet old enough for a man , nor young enough for a boy , as a squash is before 'tis a peascod , or a codling when 'tis almost an apple .
Why , this is excellent .
A false conclusion .
And some have greatness thrust upon them." Heaven restore thee !
Signior Fabian , stay you by this gentleman till my return .
His employment between his lord and my niece confirms no less .
Here comes the fool , i ' faith .
Thy Fates open their hands .
What is decreed must be , and be this so .
What think you of this fool , Malvolio ?
When did I see thee so put down ?
Are you a comedian ?
Tis not so sweet now as it was before .
Jove , I thank thee !
Art thou a churchman ?
Have you any commission from your lord to negotiate with my face ?
Nay , I'll come .
Will you deny me now ?
I must obey .
I am a fellow o ' th ' strangest mind i ' th ' world .
Thou canst not choose but know who I am .
Lead me on .
Ay , madam .
Go shake your ears !
If my lady have not called up her steward Malvolio and bid him turn you out of doors , never trust me .
Ay , is 't , I warrant him .
I may command where I adore." Why , she may command me .
Give me your hand , sir .
The Count's gentleman , one Cesario .
His very genius hath taken the infection of the device , man .
Here , wear this jewel for me .
Observe him , for the love of mockery , for I know this letter will make a contemplative idiot of him .
Not so , sir , I do care for something .
Here come the officers .
Then lead the way , good father ; and heavens so shine That they may fairly note this act of mine .
The competitors enter .
Farewell .
Here , madam , at your service .
With the same 'havior that your passion bears Goes on my master's grief .
This is a dear manikin to you , Sir Toby .
Why appear you with this ridiculous boldness before my lady ?
Even so quickly may one catch the plague ?
Nay , if you be an undertaker , I am for you .
Ay , madam , well , for I was bred and born Not three hours ' travel from this very place .
And so perchance may he be .
For him , I think not on him .
Your cousin , my lady , takes great exceptions to your ill hours .
We'll whisper o'er a couplet or two of most sage saws .
Shall we rouse the night owl in a catch that will draw three souls out of one weaver ?
You are well fleshed .
Welcome , ass .
Pursue him and entreat him to a peace .
One would think his mother's milk were scarce out of him .
Sooth , but you must .
What , what ?
Even now , sir .
It doth not fit me .
My lord and master loves you .
M" , Malvolio .
As plain as I see you now .
To the gates of Tartar , thou most excellent devil of wit !
What is your parentage ? " "Above my fortunes , yet my state is well .
Well , God give them wisdom that have it .
No , believe me .
If it be so , as 'tis , Poor lady , she were better love a dream .
Take the fool away .
Away !
My master , not myself , lacks recompense .
My purpose is , indeed , a horse of that color .
You shall hear more .
Would it be better , madam , than I am ?
I would be loath to cast away my speech , for besides that it is excellently well penned , I have taken great pains to con it .
I prithee , vent thy folly somewhere else .
Perchance he is not drown'd. , What think you , sailors ?
Thy reason , man ?
A good lenten answer .
Can you do it ?
Good gentle one , give me modest assurance if you be the lady of the house , that I may proceed in my speech .
Maria once told me she did affect me , and I have heard herself come thus near , that , should she fancy , it should be one of my complexion .
My masters , are you mad ?
My lady will hang thee for thy absence .
I saw thee late at the Count Orsino's .
Talkest thou nothing but of ladies ?
Tis too late to go to bed now .
And on the answer , he pays you as surely as your feet hit the ground they step on .
Fare thee well .
Madam , the young gentleman of the Count Orsino's is returned .
Get him to bed , and let his hurt be looked to .
Your will ?
Ay , Biddy , come with me. , What , man !
I marvel your ladyship takes delight in such a barren rascal .
She's a beagle , true-bred , and one that adores me .
Or what are you ?
If I think so , I think the same of you .
Above my fortunes , yet my state is well .
Make the trial of it in any constant question .
Where lies your text ?
What's to do ?
Anything that's mended is but patched .
Why , we shall make him mad indeed .
Shall we not , Sir Andrew ?
Yet there he was , and there I found this credit , That he did range the town to seek me out .
Come , bring us , bring us where he is .
Would thou'dst be ruled by me !
My niece is already in the belief that he's mad .
I care not for good life .
O , if I thought that , I'd beat him like a dog !
Lie thou there ( throwing down a letter ) , for here comes the trout that must be caught with tickling .
I think his soul is in hell , madonna .
Nay , that's certain .
Malvolio's coming down this walk .
I will return again into the house and desire some conduct of the lady .
What will become of this ?
Are you the lady of the house ?
If this were played upon a stage now , I could condemn it as an improbable fiction .
I could not find him at the Elephant .
Alas , I took great pains to study it , and 'tis poetical .
I will make your peace with him if I can .
doth sway my life." Nay , but first , let me see , let me see , let me see .
Nor I neither .
Yes , by Saint Anne , and ginger shall be hot i ' the mouth too .
What's she ?
And you too , sir .
No .
In Orsino's bosom .
They that add , moreover , he's drunk nightly in your company .
How now , my hearts !
If she do , he'll smile and take 't for a great favor .
Good beauties , let me sustain no scorn .
Sebastian was my father ; Such a Sebastian was my brother too , So went he suited to his watery tomb .
Wouldst thou not be glad to have the niggardly rascally sheep-biter come by some notable shame ?
If he may be conveniently delivered , I would he were , for I am now so far in offense with my niece that I can not pursue with any safety this sport to the upshot .
The better for thy friends .
I have been dear to him , lad , some two thousand strong , or so .
They lack retention .
I know not , madam .
What wouldst thou now ?
I saw 't i ' the orchard .
He shall enlarge him .
Can he that deny ?
She is drowned already , sir , with salt water , though I seem to drown her remembrance again with more .
But you , sir , altered that , for some hour before you took me from the breach of the sea was my sister drowned .
The man grows mad .
This is the man .
You are now out of your text .
Good madonna , why mournest thou ?
Besides , she uses me with a more exalted respect than anyone else that follows her .
So do not I .
Let still the woman take An elder than herself .
I dare lay any money 'twill be nothing yet .
Gentlewoman , my lady calls .
Sir Toby , I must be round with you .
He's as tall a man as any 's in Illyria .
And I , most jocund , apt , and willingly , To do you rest , a thousand deaths would die .
An they be not , let them hang themselves in their own straps .
What thinkest thou of his opinion ?
I am sure no man hath any quarrel to me .
If thou darest tempt me further , draw thy sword .
No , I do not know you , nor I am not sent to you by my lady , to bid you come speak with her , nor your name is not Master Cesario , nor this is not my nose neither .
Speak to me .
There is no obstruction in this .
This is open .
To him , Sir Topas .
How do you , Malvolio ?
That face of his I do remember well .
And by all means stir on the youth to an answer .
You , sir ?
He's fortified against any denial .
Wherefore have these gifts a curtain before 'em ?
What years , i ' faith ?
This will so fright them both that they will kill one another by the look , like cockatrices .
Away before me to sweet beds of flowers .
I am a gentleman .
A lady , sir , though it was said she much resembled me , was yet of many accounted beautiful .
Vent my folly ?
By the Lord , madam , you wrong me , and the world shall know it .
A fiend like thee might bear my soul to hell .
But tell me true , are you not mad indeed ?
When my tongue blabs , then let mine eyes not see .
Have you not set mine honor at the stake , And baited it with all the unmuzzled thoughts That tyrannous heart can think ?
Get you all three into the boxtree .
Do but read .
Do not deny .
I am bound to your niece , sir .
Are you full of them ?
Do you know what you say ?
Get you to your lord .
to fool ) Is thy lady within ?
Dismount thy tuck , be yare in thy preparation , for thy assailant is quick , skillful and deadly .
I would not so much as make water but in a sink-a-pace .
How now , Malvolio ?
Save you , gentleman .
I pity you .
I would you were as I would have you be !
Hast thou forgot thyself ?
Farewell .
Ay , but I know , What dost thou know ?
And cross-gartered ?
Jove and my stars be praised !

Come hither , knight .
Who saw Cesario , ho ?
By my troth , the fool has an excellent breast .
To answer by the method , in the first of his heart .
A wreck past hope he was .
By this hand , I am .
I'll help you , Sir Toby , because we'll be dressed together .
Some achieve greatness , " What sayest thou ?
Make that good .
What should I think on 't ?
For his thoughts , Would they were blanks , rather than fill'd with me .
And you , sir .
Then hadst thou had an excellent head of hair .
It did come to his hands , and commands shall be executed .
A contagious breath .
Anything .
Pray God , he keep his oath !
Madam , I will .
I will be strange , stout , in yellow stockings , and cross-gartered , even with the swiftness of putting on .
Excellent !
Orsino , noble sir , Be pleased that I shake off these names you give me .
Come , my young soldier , put up your iron .
em all three all ready .
Madam ?
He did me kindness , sir , drew on my side , But in conclusion put strange speech upon me .
Good Sir Toby !
Come , boy , with me .
But this is from my commission .
Does she so ?
No , not a grize .
Will you hoist sail , sir ?
I prithee , foolish Greek , depart from me .
With drinking healths to my niece .
Have you no wit , manners , nor honesty but to gabble like tinkers at this time of night ?
But it becomes me well enough , does 't not ?
I pray you , sir , what is he ?
Where's my cousin Toby ?
Sir , I have not you by the hand .
Never trust me , then .
Still in this fashion , color , ornament , For him I imitate .
She loves me , sure !
Vent my folly !
Well-a-day that you were , sir .
I can say little more than I have studied , and that question's out of my part .
Who of my people hold him in delay ?
My kind Antonio , I can no other answer make but thanks , And thanks , and ever thanks .
Or I'll deliver thy indignation to him by word of mouth .
I know I can do it .
I have many enemies in Orsino's court , Else would I very shortly see thee there .
I will do so .
He , upon some action , Is now in durance at Malvolio's suit , A gentleman and follower of my lady's .
His life I gave him and did thereto add My love , without retention or restraint , All his in dedication .
Pox on 't !
It is no matter how witty , so it be eloquent and full of invention .
But we will draw the curtain and show you the picture .
For women are as roses , whose fair flower Being once displayed , doth fall that very hour .
Souls and bodies hath he divorced three , and his incensement at this moment is so implacable that satisfaction can be none but by pangs of death and sepulchre .
If it please the eye of one , it is with me as the very true sonnet is , "Please one , and please all." Why , how dost thou , man ?
Fare thee well .
So that by my foes , sir I profit in the knowledge of myself , and by my friends , I am abused .
What's the matter ?
I am all the daughters of my father's house , And all the brothers too , and yet I know not .
And ask no other dowry with her but such another jest .
Why , what's the matter ?
O , you give me ill counsel .
And you , sir .
What , to perverseness ?
Father , I charge thee , by thy reverence , Here to unfold ( though lately we intended To keep in darkness what occasion now Reveals before 'tis ripe ) what thou dost know Hath newly passed between this youth and me .
It shines everywhere .
Then he's a rogue , and a passy-measures pavin .
Come , Sir Andrew , there's no remedy .
Even what it please my lord that shall become him .
Tell him he shall not speak with me .
Cesario is your servant's name , fair princess .
I know thee well .
FOOL Oh , he's drunk , Sir Toby , an hour agone .
Get him to say his prayers , good Sir Toby , get him to pray .
Antonio , I arrest thee at the suit of Count Orsino .
It alone concerns your ear .
Good Mistress Accost , I desire better acquaintance .
Why , then , build me thy fortunes upon the basis of valor .
Good my mouse of virtue , answer me .
Go , hang yourselves all !
No , madam , I do but read madness .
And on that vice in him will my revenge find notable cause to work .
I have not seen such a firago .
I was adored once too .
Let him approach .
Has here writ a letter to you .
Be you his eunuch , and your mute I'll be .
I wish it might , for now I am your fool .
Of what nature the wrongs are thou hast done him , I know not , but thy intercepter , full of despite , bloody as the hunter , attends thee at the orchard end .
His dishonesty appears in leaving his friend here in necessity and denying him .
He is knight , dubbed with unhatched rapier and on carpet consideration , but he is a devil in private brawl .
I have sent after him .
Is 't not well done ?
Sir Toby , madam , your kinsman .
Madam , I will .
And what should I do in Illyria ?
As hell , Sir Topas .
Open 't , and read it .
Fool !
This was looked for at your hand , and this was balked .
He says he'll come .
If that this simple syllogism will serve , so .
More matter for a May morning .
Come , sir , away .
I tell thee true .
I could be sad .
If I lose a scruple of this sport , let me be boiled to death with melancholy .
I know his soul is in heaven , fool .
Give me now leave to leave thee .
Go to , you're a dry fool .
One face , one voice , one habit , and two persons !
Virtue that transgresses is but patched with sin , and sin that amends is but patched with virtue .
You stand amazed , But be of comfort .
I have heard of some kind of men that put quarrels purposely on others , to taste their valor .
If you will see it , follow me .
I am not of your element .
Gentleman , God save thee .
Truly , madam , he holds Beelzebub at the staves ' end as well as a man in his case may do .
How is 't with you ?
Of very ill manner .
Spend this for me .
This shall end without the perdition of souls .
What means this lady ?
No , sir , I live by the church .
So I do , madonna .
Slight , will you make an ass o ' me ?
Fear not , Cesario .
How now ?
You might have saved me my pains to have taken it away yourself .
Good madam , let me see your face .
Ay , but he will not now be pacified .
I am bound to the Count Orsino's court .
Go , write it in a martial hand .
Only myself stood out ; For which , if I be lapsed in this place , I shall pay dear .
Fool , fool , fool , I say !
An 't be any way , it must be with valor , for policy I hate .
But out of question , 'tis Maria's hand .
Oh , if it prove , Tempests are kind and salt waves fresh in love !
Remain thou still in darkness .
I left no ring with her .
Let us therefore eat and drink .
What is his name ?
I know thy constellation is right apt For this affair .
Come , sir , I pray you , go .
I had as lief be a Brownist as a politician .
My servant , sir !
For Monsieur Malvolio , let me alone with him .
One , sir , that for his love dares yet do more Than you have heard him brag to you he will .
Excellent .
Most sweet lady , A comfortable doctrine , and much may be said of it .
But here the lady comes .
Sweet lady , ho , ho .
Did she see thee the while , old boy ?
She made good view of me , indeed so much That sure methought her eyes had lost her tongue , For she did speak in starts distractedly .
There's one at the gate .
What dost thou mean ?
Twill endure wind and weather .
Belike you slew great number of his people ?
In the wars .
Ay , he .
A most extracting frenzy of mine own From my remembrance clearly banished his .
Here comes the man , sir , that did rescue me .
Let me yet know of you whither you are bound .
I would be sorry , sir , but the fool should be as oft with your master as with my mistress : I think I saw your wisdom there .
I never hurt you .
What money , sir ?
I can not love him .
And , to inure thyself to what thou art like to be , cast thy humble slough and appear fresh .
That's a degree to love .
Does he rave ?
Why , what are you ?
He can not by the duello avoid it .
Come , we'll have him in a dark room and bound .
On thy life I charge thee , hold !
And died that day when Viola from her birth Had numbered thirteen years .
He does smile his face into more lines than is in the new map with the augmentation of the Indies .
But oh , how vile an idol proves this god !
I thank you .
Master Malvolio ?
He started one poor heart of mine in thee .
Sad , lady !
By my troth , Sir Toby , you must come in earlier o ' nights .
I have heard her swear 't .
I'll come to him .
I say , there is no darkness but ignorance , in which thou art more puzzled than the Egyptians in their fog .
I am not such an ass , but I can keep my hand dry .
My father had a daughter loved a man As it might be , perhaps , were I a woman , I should your lordship .
I take pleasure in singing , sir .
Yet you will be hanged for being so long absent .
She that would alter services with thee , The Fortunate Unhappy" Daylight and champaign discovers not more .
Notable pirate !
Her husband , sirrah ?
Soft , soft !
My duty , madam , and most humble service .
You are resolute , then ?
If you be not mad , be gone .
It is heresy .
Good Master Fabian , grant me another request .
If this letter move him not , his legs can not .
He left behind him myself and a sister , both born in an hour .
Take away the lady .
Is that the meaning of "accost" ?
Fate , show thy force .
Tell me that .
For this night , to bed , and dream on the event .
He's a coward and a coistrel that will not drink to my niece till his brains turn o ' th ' toe like a parish top .
God send you , sir , a speedy infirmity , for the better increasing your folly !
I must catechise you for it , madonna .
To him in thine own voice , and bring me word how thou findest him .
It hangs like flax on a distaff .
Give me excess of it that , surfeiting , The appetite may sicken , and so die .
Past question , for thou seest it will not curl by nature .
And they have been grand-jurymen since before Noah was a sailor .
Who does beguile you ?
I'll drink to her as long as there is a passage in my throat and drink in Illyria .
What's a drunken man like , fool ?
Shall I play my freedom at tray-trip , and become thy bondslave ?
If Sir Toby would leave drinking , thou wert as witty a piece of Eve's flesh as any in Illyria .
It is too hard a knot for me to untie !
What o ' that ?
Therefore in my presence still smile , dear my sweet , I prithee."
How now !
He'll speak with you , will you or no .
Tut , there's life in 't , man .
Observe his construction of it .
Ay , marry , what is he ?
I will on with my speech in your praise and then show you the heart of my message .
I hate a drunken rogue .
I say to you this house is dark .
It shall advantage thee more than ever the bearing of letter did .
She did commend my yellow stockings of late , she did praise my leg being cross-gartered , and in this she manifests herself to my love , and with a kind of injunction , drives me to these habits of her liking .
I am no fee'd post , lady .
I told him you were sick .
He is , indeed , sir , the most skillful , bloody , and fatal opposite that you could possibly have found in any part of Illyria .
Well held out , i ' faith .
Sir !
No man must know." What follows ?
Nay , but say true , does it work upon him ?
Come , away !
How now ?
Come to what is important in 't .
Sir Topas , Sir Topas !
Thy smiles become thee well .
The honorable lady of the house , which is she ?
Sir , I bade them take away you .
I do I know not what and fear to find Mine eye too great a flatterer for my mind .
What kind of woman is't ?
If you desire the spleen , and will laugh yourself into stitches , follow me .
Farewell .
Of what personage and years is he ?
Gracious Olivia , What do you say , Cesario ? , Good my lord , My lord would speak .
Once more , Cesario , Get thee to yond same sovereign cruelty .
Fear'st thou that , Antonio ?
He speaks nothing but madman .
I'll be your purse-bearer and leave you For an hour .
A stoup of wine !
Art thou mad ?
Approach , Sir Andrew .
To one of your receiving Enough is shown .
Nothing that can be can come between me and the full prospect of my hopes .
You can fool no more money out of me at this throw .
You lie .
But in my conscience , sir , I do not care for you .
How now , Malvolio !
Cesario , you do not keep promise with me .
He hath not told us of the captain yet .
Of your complexion .
You may have very fit occasion for 't .
Do it quickly .
Sweet Sir Andrew !
Look you , sir , such a one I was this present .
He has been yonder i ' the sun practising behavior to his own shadow this half hour .
Wilt thou go to bed , Malvolio ?
What say you sir ?
Tell me why .
I shall answer for her .
Fare you well at once .
Taurus !
We shall have a rare letter from him : but you'll not deliver 't ?
Twas never merry world Since lowly feigning was call'd compliment .
He's coming , madam ; but in very strange manner .
Whence came you , sir ?
He hath known you but three days , and already you are no stranger .
Your ladyship were best to have some guard about you if he come , for sure the man is tainted in 's wits .
None can be called deformed but the unkind .
This concurs directly with the letter .
And so they are .
On a moderate pace I have since arrived but hither .
But if he had not been in drink , he would have tickled you othergates than he did .
That defense thou hast , betake thee to 't .
I'll follow this good man , and go with you ; And , having sworn truth , ever will be true .
I will meditate the while upon some horrid message for a challenge .
That you do think you are not what you are .
No , sooth , sir .
Very sweet and contagious , i ' faith .
Accost , Sir Andrew , accost .
Come , throw it o'er my face .
Marian , I say !
There is no way but this , Sir Andrew .
Hold little faith , though thou hast too much fear .
Art not thou the Lady Olivia's fool ?
If you will not murder me for my love , let me be your servant .
Marry , sir , lullaby to your bounty till I come again .
He's in yellow stockings .
The knave counterfeits well .
The more fool , madonna , to mourn for your brother's soul being in heaven .
Now , as thou lovest me , let me see his letter .
Fool , I say !
Yes , being kept together and put to use .
Must she not then be answered ?
Nay , pursue him now , lest the device take air and taint .
He is sad and civil And suits well for a servant with my fortunes .
Troth , sir , I can yield you none without words , and words are grown so false , I am loath to prove reason with them .
Let all the rest give place .
Fabian can scarce hold him yonder .
Who was it ?
Good fool , for my brother's death .
Let me see the caper .
I would therefore my sister had no name , sir .
Fie , that you'll say so !
There's another .
A little , by your favor .
But as well ?
Good Maria , let this fellow be looked to .
You mistake , sir .
Go call him hither .
Hang him , foul collier !
O good Sir Toby , hold !
No , sir , the worse .
Oh , you are sick of self-love , Malvolio , and taste with a distempered appetite .
What a caterwauling do you keep here !
Who hath made this havoc with them ?
To be Count Malvolio !
Tis not for gravity to play at cherry-pit with Satan .
Methinks his words do from such passion fly , That he believes himself .
In what chapter of his bosom ?
And for his cowardship , ask Fabian .
Put them to motion .
What , Curio ?
Fair lady , do you think you have fools in hand ?
You , uncivil lady , To whose ingrate and unauspicious altars My soul the faithfull'st off'rings have breathed out That e'er devotion tendered , what shall I do ?
I'll do my best To woo your lady , Whoe'er I woo , myself would be his wife .
Sweet Sir Toby , be patient for tonight .
Why , he has three thousand ducats a year .
A spirit I am indeed , But am in that dimension grossly clad Which from the womb I did participate .
Oh , that I served that lady And might not be delivered to the world , Till I had made mine own occasion mellow , What my estate is .
I had rather than forty pound I were at home .
I could marry this wench for this device .
Go .
And when she went away now , "Let this fellow be looked to." "Fellow ! " Not "Malvolio , " nor after my degree , but "fellow." Why , everything adheres together , that no dram of a scruple , no scruple of a scruple , no obstacle , no incredulous or unsafe circumstance , what can be said ?
Tell me your mind .
I have 't in my nose too .
Some are born great , some achieve greatness , and some have greatness thrust upon 'em .
A gentleman .
I say , this house is as dark as ignorance , though ignorance were as dark as hell .
Madam , yond young fellow swears he will speak with you .
Alas , their love may be called appetite , No motion of the liver , but the palate , That suffer surfeit , cloyment , and revolt ; But mine is all as hungry as the sea , And can digest as much .
Who , Sir Andrew Aguecheek ?
I'll have an action of battery against him if there be any law in Illyria .
I hate it as an unfilled can .
Still so cruel ?
He left this ring behind him , Would I or not .
I'll write thee a challenge .
A noble duke , in nature As in name .
I will acquit you .
And your horse now would make him an ass .
Let the garden door be shut , and leave me to my hearing .
Thou mightst have done this without thy beard and gown .
I'll serve this duke .
I did think , by the excellent constitution of thy leg , it was formed under the star of a galliard .
I know my physic will work with him .
I will help you to 't .
Nay , let him alone .
And what's her history ?
That's all one : has hurt me , and there's the end on 't .
Here lies your way .
I will not give my part of this sport for a pension of thousands to be paid from the Sophy .
I saw him put down the other day with an ordinary fool that
I sent for thee upon a sad occasion .
Not to be abed after midnight is to be up betimes , and Nay , my troth , I know not .
I can tell thee where that saying was born , of "I fear no colors." Where , good Mistress Mary ?
Write loyal cantons of contemned love And sing them loud even in the dead of night .
The madly used Malvolio." Did he write this ?
But if she can not love you , sir ?
I pray you , keep it in .
This is Illyria , lady .
Most certain , if you are she , you do usurp yourself , for what is yours to bestow is not yours to reserve .
Now let's have a catch .
Ay me , detested !
Good .
But , come what may , I do adore thee so That danger shall seem sport , and I will go .
My remembrance is very free and clear from any image of offense done to any man .
I can hardly forbear hurling things at him .
Come by and by to my chamber .
What is to be said to him , lady ?
Let me speak a little .
I prithee now , ungird thy strangeness and tell me what I shall vent to my lady .
Believe me , I am not .
Well , come again tomorrow .
We took him for a coward , but he's the very devil incardinate .
There is no woman's sides Can bide the beating of so strong a passion As love doth give my heart .
Stay , I prithee , tell me what thou thinkest of me .
If not , an it would please you to take leave of her , she is very willing to bid you farewell .
My most exquisite Sir Topas !
By your patience , no .
If thou hast her not i ' the end , call me "Cut." If I do not , never trust me , take it how you will .
I will give out divers schedules of my beauty .
Be not afraid of greatness." 'T was well writ .
No , indeed , sir ; the Lady Olivia has no folly .
Do you come near me now ?
Put up your sword .
This savors not much of distraction .
I will be proud , I will read politic authors , I will baffle Sir Toby , I will wash off gross acquaintance , I will be point- devise the very man .
Bonos dies , Sir Toby .
Sir Toby Belch !
I am as mad as he , If sad and merry madness equal be .
Tis with him in standing water , between boy and man .
Like a drowned man , a fool and a madman .
A good knave .
Yet I suppose him virtuous , know him noble , Of great estate , of fresh and stainless youth .
So thou mayst say the king lies by a beggar if a beggar dwell near him , or the church stands by thy tabor , if thy tabor stand by the church .
Where goes Cesario ?
My name is Mary , sir .
What is the opinion of Pythagoras concerning wildfowl ?
Fortune forbid my outside have not charmed her !
But , if you were the devil , you are fair .
Marry , sir , they praise me and make an ass of me , now my foes tell me plainly I am an ass .
Or o ' mine either ?
This is as uncivil as strange .
Nay , I prithee , put on this gown and this beard .
I thank my stars I am happy .
Is it a world to hide virtues in ?
And so adieu , good madam .
He will bear you easily and reins well .
But that it would be double-dealing , sir , I would you could make it another .
The lady of the Strachy married the yeoman of the wardrobe .
My prayers , minx ?
Twere as good a deed as to drink when a man's a-hungry , to challenge him the field and then to break promise with him and make a fool of him .
Nay , let me alone for swearing .
Orsino , this is that Antonio That took the And this is he that did the When your young nephew Titus lost his leg .
You know , he brought me out o ' favor with my lady about a bear-baiting here .
My lady is within , sir .
He is now in some commerce with my lady and will by and by depart .
No pains , sir .
He takes on him to understand so much , and therefore comes to speak with you .
Faith , I'll home tomorrow , Sir Toby .
Were we not born under Taurus ?
In his bosom ?
Will you help ? , An ass-head , and a coxcomb , and a knave , a thin-faced knave , a gull !
You might do much .
His counsel now might do me golden service .
You should then have accosted her , and with some excellent jests , fire-new from the mint , you should have banged the youth into dumbness .
Have you no more to say ?
My life upon 't , young though thou art , thine eye Hath stay'd upon some favor that it loves .
A very dishonest paltry boy , and more a coward than a hare .
A dry jest , sir .
An apple , cleft in two , is not more twin Than these two creatures .
Run after that same peevish messenger , The county's man .
I warrant thou art a merry fellow and carest for nothing .
Let's to bed , knight .
He seems to have a foreknowledge of that too , and therefore comes to speak with you .
If all the devils of hell be drawn in little , and Legion himself possessed him , yet I'll speak to him .
I'll make one too .
What is your name ?
I think you set nothing by a bloody coxcomb .
If a bloody coxcomb be a hurt , you have hurt me .
If you can separate yourself and your misdemeanors , you are welcome to the house .
I defy lechery .
And so had mine .
Most excellent accomplished lady , the heavens rain odors on you !
Thou shalt not be the worse for me : there's gold .
M.O.A.I." This simulation is not as the former , and yet to crush this a little , it would bow to me , for every one of these letters are in my name .
Give me .
Dexterously , good madonna .
Now Mercury endue thee with leasing , for thou speakest well of fools !
Ha ?
What country , friends , is this ?
No , sir , no jot .
If one should be a prey , how much the better To fall before the lion than the wolf !
He's a very fool and a prodigal .
Oh , say so , and so be !
Slid , I'll after him again and beat him .
O , my poor brother !
Say that some lady , as perhaps there is , Hath for your love a great a pang of heart As you have for Olivia .
Sneck up !
I leave my duty a little unthought of and speak out of my injury .
I shall be constrained in 't to call thee knave , knight .
I call thee by the most modest terms , for I am one of those gentle ones that will use the devil himself with courtesy .
Remember who commended thy yellow stockings , " Thy yellow stockings ?
But yet I can not love him ; He might have took his answer long ago .
Doth he not mend ?
Give me my veil .
His eyes were set at eight i ' the morning .
An you love me , let's do 't .
I prithee , be gone .
But I perceive in you so excellent a touch of modesty that you will not extort from me what I am willing to keep in .
Most radiant , exquisite and unmatchable beauty , I pray you , tell me if this be the lady of the house , for I never saw her .
Most villanously , like a pedant that keeps a school i ' the church .
That the soul of our grandam might haply inhabit a bird .
Back you shall not to the house , unless you undertake that with me which with as much safety you might answer him .
He has heard that word of some great man and now applies it to a fool .
And yet , by the very fangs of malice I swear , I am not that I play .
If one knight give a , Would you have a love song or a song of good life ?
No , my lord , not I. Alas , it is the baseness of thy fear That makes thee strangle thy propriety .
Dear lad , believe it .
Since the youth of the count's was today with thy lady , she is much out of quiet .
O good Antonio , forgive me your trouble .
Nay , then I must have an ounce or two of this malapert blood from you .
It hath no tongue to vex you .
Farewell , fair cruelty .
What gentleman ?
Hurt him in eleven places .
Go off , I discard you .
Nay , good Sir Toby .
I'll go another way to work with him .
The count himself here hard by woos her .
Ay , ay .
Out of my sight ! , Be not offended , dear Cesario. , Rudesby , be gone !
By my troth , thou hast an open hand .
I think nobly of the soul , and no way approve his opinion .
Husband ?
Sir Toby will be sworn that I am no fox , but he will not pass his word for two pence that you are no fool .
True , madam .
Why , this is evident to any formal capacity .
An you part so , mistress , I would I might never draw sword again .
Here comes my noble gull-catcher .
Away !
But I know to be up late is to be up late .
He has broke my head across and has given Sir Toby a bloody coxcomb too .
Here comes the count .
What meanest thou by that , Malvolio ?
For the love of God , a surgeon !
O Lord !
Let me be clear of thee .
I'll no more of you .
I think not so , my lord .
There's money for thee .
What is the matter with thee ?
Wherefore , sweetheart ?
Farewell .
Fare you well .
Dear lady , Give me leave , beseech you .
Nay , come , I prithee .
The captain that did bring me first on shore Hath my maid's garments .
If thou entertainest my love , let it appear in thy smiling .
I can not be so answer'd .
The gentleness of all the gods go with thee !
Hob , nob , is his word .
I go , sir , but I would not have you to think that my desire of having is the sin of covetousness .
My determinate voyage is mere extravagancy .
Thou shalt hold the opinion of Pythagoras ere I will allow of thy wits , and fear to kill a woodcock lest thou dispossess the soul of thy grandam .
I do not now fool myself , to let imagination jade me , for every reason excites to this , that my lady loves me .
If the heavens had been pleased , would we had so ended !
So , let me hear you speak .
I forgive you the praise .
I say , remember .
To anger him , we'll have the bear again , and we will fool him black and blue .
Not black in my mind , though yellow in my legs .
I think we do know the sweet Roman hand .
Will you go hunt , my lord ?
Dost thou live by thy tabour ?
What I am and what I would are as secret as maidenhead .
Then let thy love be younger than thyself , Or thy affection can not hold the bent .
What's that ?
So could I too .
How have you made division of yourself ?
Shall we do that ?
Will you walk towards him ?
Lechery !
O , sir , I will not be so hard-hearted .
Do not then walk too open .
How with mine honor may I give him that Which I have given to you ?
Therefore get you on and give him his desire .
No , my profound heart .
Nothing but this : your true love for my master .
Marry , and it shall be done tomorrow morning if I live .
Pardon me , sweet one , even for the vows We made each other but so late ago .
Belike this is a man of that quirk .
Save thee , friend , and thy music .
Who governs here ?
But to read his right wits is to read thus .
For but a month ago I went from hence , And then 'twas fresh in murmur , as , you know , What great ones do the less will prattle of , That he did seek the love of fair Olivia .
What shall you ask of me that I'll deny , That honor , saved , may upon asking give ?
I have heard my father name him .
Nay , I'll ne'er believe a madman till I see his brains .
I can not love him .
Too well what love women to men may owe .
Alas , Malvolio , this is not my writing , Though , I confess , much like the character .
Sayest thou that house is dark ?
How can this be ?
I'll not meddle with him .
I did send , After the last enchantment you did here , A ring in chase of you .
Though you have put me into darkness and given your drunken cousin rule over me , yet have I the benefit of my senses as well as your Ladyship .
Ay , my lord , this same .
Come on , to 't .
Alas , that they are so , To die even when they to perfection grow !
Good madonna , give me leave to prove you a fool .
Here comes the Countess .
It might have since been answered in repaying What we took from them , which , for traffic's sake , Most of our city did .
But , as you say , sir , let your bounty take a nap , I will awake it anon .
A baubling vessel was he captain of , For shallow draught and bulk unprizable , With which such scathful grapple did he make With the most noble bottom of our fleet , That very envy and the tongue of loss Cried fame and honor on him. , What's the matter ?
Ass , I doubt not .
I mean , to go , sir , to enter .
I had a pass with him , rapier , scabbard , and all , and he gives me the stuck-in with such a mortal motion , that it is inevitable .
You'll find it otherwise , I assure you .
Good .
How vexest thou this man !
O knight , thou lackest a cup of canary .
Have I , Malvolio ?
Who does do you wrong ?
This was a great argument of love in her toward you .
An we do not , it is pity of our lives .
Refuse it not .
I am no more mad than you are .
Why , man , he's a very devil .
As I am a gentleman , I will live to be thankful to thee for 't .
I'll make division of my present with you .
Methinks sometimes I have no more wit than a Christian or an ordinary man has .
I will be free from thee .
His indignation derives itself out of a very competent injury .
Oh , I have read it .
Here comes my lady .
It is the more like to be feigned .
Were not you even now with the Countess Olivia ?
M" , why , that begins my name .
I could not stay behind you .
Give them way till he take leave , and presently after him .
Ay , good fool .
Good night , Penthesilea .
I should have given 't you today morning , but as a madman's epistles are no gospels , so it skills not much when they are delivered .
If I do not usurp myself , I am .
Yet , when I saw it last , it was besmeared As black as Vulcan in the smoke of war .
Nay , I am for all waters .
Away with him .
Take away the fool , gentlemen .
Let her hang me .
How will this fadge ?
You have said , sir .
My niece shall take note of it , and assure thyself , there is no love-broker in the world can more prevail in man's commendation with woman than report of valor .
One draught above heat makes him a fool , the second mads him , and a third drowns him .
I am the man .
Is it so long ? , Call forth the holy father .
Thou know'st not me .
I thank you for your pains .
Why , sir , her name's a word , and to dally with that word might make my sister wanton .
I'll stay a month longer .
Ourselves we do not owe .
Here comes Sir Toby halting .
Here he is , here he is .
What is he at the gate , cousin ?
Shall I vent to her that thou art coming ?
Do 't , knight .
He shall see none to fear .
A love song , a love song .
No way but gentleness , gently , gently .
Cesario , come , For so you shall be , while you are a man .
What a plague means my niece , to take the death of her brother thus ?
For the love of God , your help !
I'll give 't him .
Thou'rt i ' the right .
Come thy ways , Signior Fabian .
I will construe to them whence you come .
Is there no respect of place , persons , nor time in you ?
Oh , ho !
Give me some music .
I hate ingratitude more in a man Than lying , vainness , babbling , drunkenness , Or any taint of vice whose strong corruption Inhabits our frail blood , O heavens themselves !
My lady has a white hand , and the Myrmidons are no bottle-ale houses .
He knows I know him well .
See him delivered , Fabian ; bring him hither .
At your request !
It is something of my negligence , nothing of my purpose .
Besides , you grow dishonest .
Give me faith , say I .
My matter hath no voice , lady , but to your own most pregnant and vouchsafed ear .
Give me thy hand , And let me see thee in thy woman's weeds .
Never in your life , I think , unless you see canary put me down .
Are they like to take dust , like Mistress Mall's picture ?
Smilest thou ?
Most wonderful !
Give us the place alone .
How is't with you , sir ?
I am afraid this great lubber , the world , will prove a cockney .
And now I do bethink me , it was she First told me thou wast mad , then camest in smiling , And in such forms which here were presupposed Upon thee in the letter .
Make him believe thou art Sir Topas the curate .
Hold , sir , or I'll throw your dagger o'er the house .
Excellent good , i ' faith .
Think of me as you please .
In faith , they are as true of heart as we .
In voices well divulged , free , learned , and valiant ; And in dimension and the shape of nature A gracious person .
And yet complainest thou of obstruction ?
Do you not hear , fellows ?
Unless the master were the man .
Tell her my love , more noble than the world , Prizes not quantity of dirty lands ; The parts that fortune hath bestowed upon her , Tell her , I hold as giddily as fortune ; But 'tis that miracle and queen of gems That nature pranks her in attracts my soul .
Marry , will I , sir .
Hold , Toby !
Yes , and shall do till the pangs of death shake him .
I frown the while , and perchance wind up watch , or play with my , some rich jewel .
There is a fair behavior in thee , captain , And though that nature with a beauteous wall Doth oft close in pollution , yet of thee I will believe thou hast a mind that suits With this thy fair and outward character .
Why , man ?
Some are born great , "
You shall know more hereafter .
He shall think , by the letters that thou wilt drop , that they come from my niece , and that she's in love with him .
I'll make the motion .
I'll none of it .
Oh , it came o'er my ear like the sweet sound , That breathes upon a bank of violets , Stealing and giving odor .
Here comes the little villain .
Ay , 'tis strong , and it does indifferent well in a dun-colored stock .
How now , my metal of India ?
If that be to care for nothing , sir , I would it would make you invisible .
I'll pay thy pleasure then .
Prithee , be content .
Good , i ' faith .
What would my lord , but that he may not have , Wherein Olivia may seem serviceable ?
An I do not , Come , let's see the event .
Oh , 'twill be admirable !
Scout me for him at the corner the orchard like a bum-baily .
Will either of you bear me a challenge to him ?
He hath been most notoriously abused .
Come , sir , you peevishly threw it to her , and her will is it should be so returned .
No , sir , it is legs and thighs .
Art thou good at these kickshawses , knight ?
A mellifluous voice , as I am true knight .
So that , conclusions to be as kisses , if your four negatives make your two affirmatives , why then the worse for my friends and the better for my foes .
He is as horribly conceited of him , and pants and looks pale , as if a bear were at his heels .
Well , I will be so much a sinner , to be a double-dealer .
Let thy blood and spirit embrace them .
He finished indeed his mortal act That day that made my sister thirteen years .
I protest I take these wise men that crow so at these set kind of fools no better than the fools ' zanies .
Speak your office .
He is not here , so please your lordship , that should sing it .
The fiend is rough and will not be roughly used .
Seven of my people , with an obedient start , make out for him .
Orsino .
Sport royal , I warrant you .
Why , what would you ?
The cunning of her passion Invites me in this churlish messenger .
He is about the house .
These wise men that give fools money get themselves a good report , after fourteen years ' purchase .
Here he comes with your niece .
I bring no overture of war , no taxation of homage .
My words are as full of peace as matter .
Be that thou know'st thou art , and then thou art As great as that thou fear'st .
Come , sir , I will not let you go .
I am very comptible , even to the least sinister usage .
Aha !
I beseech you , what manner of man is he ?
It begins "Hold thy peace." I shall never begin if I hold my peace .
How say you to that , Malvolio ?
Andrew Aguecheek"
Peace , you rogue , no more o ' that .
How quickly the wrong side may be turned outward !
I have no exquisite reason for 't , but I have reason good enough .
Shall we go see the relics of this town ?
I thank thee .
Is this the madman ?
I will plant you two , and let the fool make a third , where he shall find the letter .
My lord , I do protest , O , do not swear !
Well , sir , for want of other idleness , I'll bide your proof .
There's something in 't That is deceivable .
What wilt thou do ?
Belong you to the Lady Olivia , friends ?
He sees thee not .
Why do you speak to me ?
Thou hadst need send for more money .
Lead me on .
Come hither , Fabian .
I shall be much bound to you for 't .
Go to , thou art made , if thou desirest to be so , " Am I made ?
Before me , she's a good wench .
But what's your jest ?
Which is Sebastian ?
I know my lady will strike him .
Will it be ever thus ?
Come on .
Fool , I'll requite it in the highest degree .
Out o ' tune , sir .
She did show favor to the youth in your sight only to exasperate you , to awake your dormouse valor , to put fire in your heart and brimstone in your liver .
I'll confine myself no finer than I am .
Therefore this letter , being so excellently ignorant , will breed no terror in the youth .
I would not have him miscarry for the half of my dowry .
You are idle , shallow things .
Lips , do not move ; No man must know."
In my stars I am above thee , but be not afraid of greatness .
Well , go thy way .
Sir , shall I to this lady ?
I would exult , man .
Or do you but counterfeit ?
Madman , thou errest .
Be clamorous , and leap all civil bounds , Rather than make unprofited return .
For they shall yet belie thy happy years That say thou art a man .
I delight in masques and revels sometimes altogether .
This does make some obstruction in the blood , this cross-gartering , but what of that ?
Were you a woman , as the rest goes even , I should my tears let fall upon your cheek And say "Thrice-welcome , drowned Viola ! " My father had a mole upon his brow .
We did keep time , sir , in our catches .
From the Count Orsino , is it ?
She took the ring of me .
I am not mad , Sir Topas .
I know your favor well , Though now you have no sea-cap on your head. , Take him away .
And I beseech you come again tomorrow .
Let our catch be "Thou Knave." "Hold thy peace , thou knave , " knight ?
Let some of my people have a special care of him .
You must needs yield your reason , Sir Andrew .
What manner of man ?
You have not seen such a thing as 'tis .
Not too fast !
My lady would not lose him for more than I'll say .
Are you ready , sir ?
Madam !
Good fool , some ink , paper , and light , and convey what I will set down to my lady .
I beseech you , do me this courteous office , as to know of the knight what my offense to him is .
How have the hours racked and tortured me Since I have lost thee !
Is 't possible ?
An thou let part so , Sir Andrew , would thou mightst never draw sword again .
Your lord does know my mind .
Why , would that have mended my hair ?
If it be a suit from the count , I am sick , or not at home .
I ' faith , or I either ?
Hath it not , boy ?
He was a bachelor then .
Let me enjoy my private .
Who has done this , Sir Andrew ?
By my troth , sir , no , though it please you to be one of my friends .
O , by your leave , I pray you , I bade you never speak again of him .
He will find it comes from a clodpole .
Thou shall present me as an eunuch to him .
The triplex , sir , is a good tripping measure , or the bells of Saint Bennet , sir , may put you in mind , one , two , three .
Why , "some are born great , some achieve greatness , and some have greatness thrown upon them." I was one , sir , in this interlude , one Sir Topas , sir , but that's all one .
Why , I think so .
These clothes are good enough to drink in , and so be these boots too .
I think it well , my lord .
Come , begin .
How does he love me ?
No man must know." If this should be thee , Malvolio ?
So full of shapes is fancy That it alone is high fantastical .
No woman's heart So big , to hold so much .
Good fool , as ever thou wilt deserve well at my hand , help me to a candle , and pen , ink , and paper .
How can that be ?
Was not this love indeed ?
Well , Jove , not I , is the doer of this , and he is to be thanked .
A gentleman ?
Hold , there's expenses for thee .
I may command where I adore , But silence , like a Lucrece knife , With bloodless stroke my heart doth gore ; M.O.A.I .
Yes , nightingales answer daws !
Sebastian are you ?
Very brief , and to exceeding good sense , less .
Make no compare Between that love a woman can bear me And that I owe Olivia .
Orsino .
Madam , you have done me wrong , Notorious wrong .
Go off .
My duty hushes me .
Marry , now I let go your hand , I am barren .
Look then to be well edified when the fool delivers the madman .
Why , let her except , before excepted .
Primo , secundo , tertio is a good play , and the old saying is , the third pays for all .
But he has promised me , as he is a gentleman and a soldier , he will not hurt you .
Infirmity , that decays the wise , doth ever make the better fool .
Oh , that record is lively in my soul !
For the love o ' God , peace !
If you will let your lady know I am here to speak with her , and bring her along with you , it may awake my bounty further .
I will fetch you light , and paper , and ink .
Alas the day !
Well , let it be. , What ho , Malvolio !
Soft , here follows prose .
How now , Sir Toby Belch !
She is not worth thee , then .
Still so constant , lord .
Ay , husband .
Whither , my lord ? , Cesario , husband , stay .
Thou'rt a scholar .
Plague on 't , an I thought he had been valiant and so cunning in fence , I'd have seen him damned ere I'd have challenged him .
Send one presently to Sir Toby .
Why , thou hast put him in such a dream that when the image of it leaves him he must run mad .
But , sir , I will deliver his challenge by word of mouth , set upon Aguecheek a notable report of valor , and drive the gentleman ( as I know his youth will aptly receive it ) into a most hideous opinion of his rage , skill , fury , and impetuosity .
Tis a fair young man , and well attended .
Still you keep o ' the windy side of the law .
And for that I promised you , I'll be as good as my word .
Know'st thou this country ?
I know not what 'twas but distraction .
Tis my picture .
Where's Antonio , then ?
But died thy sister of her love , my boy ?
O time , thou must untangle this , not I .
For youth is bought more oft than begged or borrow'd .
Cast thy humble slough , " says she .
I prithee , and I'll pay thee bounteously , Conceal me what I am , and be my aid For such disguise as haply shall become The form of my intent .
She returns this ring to you , sir .
Stand here , make a good show on 't .
My brother he is in Elysium .
He is sure possessed , madam .
I speak too loud. , Where's Malvolio ?
Jove bless thee , master Parson .
Too old by heaven .
I have limed her , but it is Jove's doing , and Jove make me thankful !
Make me a willow cabin at your gate And call upon my soul within the house .
Od's lifelings , here he is ! , You broke my head for nothing , and that that I did , I was set on to do 't by Sir Toby .
Therefore perpend , my princess , and give ear .
What would you ?
Haply your eye shall light upon some toy You have desire to purchase , and your store , I think , is not for idle markets , sir .
Wilt thou set thy foot o ' my neck ?
Antonio , O my dear Antonio !
That's sides and heart .
To bed ?
Truly , sir , the better for my foes and the worse for my friends .
No , faith , I'll not stay a jot longer .
If he can not , let the botcher mend him .
My lady bade me tell you , that , though she harbors you as her kinsman , she's nothing allied to your disorders .
Nothing that is so is so .
Now heaven walks on earth .
Beshrew his soul for me !
Taste your legs , sir .
That most ingrateful boy there by your side From the rude sea's enraged and foamy mouth Did I redeem .
Yet you began rudely .
Receive it so .
Thy reason , dear venom , give thy reason .
My gentleman , Cesario ?
Call in my gentlewoman .
Madam , I am most apt to embrace your offer .
No , madam , he does nothing but smile .
Thou dost speak masterly .
Why , it hath bay windows transparent as barricadoes , and the clerestories toward the south-north are as lustrous as ebony .
I do remember .
Fool !
Keep your purse .
Good fool , help me to some light and some paper .
Go , Sir Andrew .
I'll call Sir Toby the whilst .
Though I struck him first , yet it's no matter for that .
Hold , there's half my coffer .
If I could make that resemble something in me , Softly !
Now Jove , in his next commodity of hair , send thee a beard !
Let him let the matter slip , and I'll give him my horse , gray Capilet .
If this young gentleman Have done offence , I take the fault on me .
Why dost thou not go to church in a galliard and come home in a coranto ?
Marry , I saw your niece do more favors to the Count's servingman than ever she bestowed upon me .
This fellow is wise enough to play the fool , And to do that well craves a kind of wit .
By my troth , I would not undertake her in this company .
This is a practise As full of labor as a wise man's art , For folly that he wisely shows is fit .
Prove true , imagination , oh , prove true , That I , dear brother , be now ta'en for you !

Death's the end of all .
Came he not home tonight ?
Oh , she knew well Thy love did read by rote , that could not spell .
I know not .
I drew to part them .
Sweet , so would I .
To wreak the love I bore my cousin Upon his body that slaughtered him !
Wisely and slow .
If I had , my weapon should quickly have been out , I warrant you .
Tis he , that villain Romeo .
Farewell , my coz .
I hear thou must , and nothing may prorogue it , On Thursday next be married to this county .
O deadly sin !
Well , peace be with you , sir .
I am peppered , I warrant , for this world .
If they do see thee they will murder thee .
What eye but such an eye would spy out such a quarrel ?
Wife !
He bears him like a portly gentleman , And , to say truth , Verona brags of him To be a virtuous and well-governed youth .
Nurse , where's my daughter ?
By my count , I was your mother much upon these years That you are now a maid .
I am sped .
Come , Romeo .
Doth not Ay , Nurse , what of that ?
And what to ?
Her eye discourses .
Oh , here's a wit of cheveril , that stretches from an inch narrow to an ell broad !
I spoke with his man .
Well , Susan is with God .
I will go along .
Thou know'st my lodging .
Who now the price of his dear blood doth owe ?
No matter .
Such comfort as do lusty young men feel When well-appareled April on the heel Of limping winter treads .
Fly hence and leave me .
You take your pennyworths now .
How sweet is love itself possessed When but love's shadows are so rich in joy !
I have an interest in your hearts ' proceeding .
Indeed , I never shall be satisfied With Romeo , till I behold him , dead , Is my poor heart for a kinsman vexed .
No , not till Thursday .
Romeo is banished." There is no end , no limit , measure , bound , In that word's death .
But all so soon as the all-cheering sun Should in the farthest east begin to draw The shady curtains from Aurora's bed , Away from light steals home my heavy son ,
I will bite my thumb at them , which is a disgrace to them , if they bear it .
O heavens !
But all this did I know before .
Oh , he's a lovely gentleman .
The fearful passage of their death-marked love And the continuance of their parents ' rage , Which , but their children's end , naught could remove , Is now the two hours ' traffic of our stage , The which , if you with patient ears attend , What here shall miss , our toil shall strive to mend .
I do beseech you , sir , have patience .
If my heart's dear love , Well , do not swear .
Look , look .
Your love says , like an honest gentleman , and a courteous , and a kind , and a handsome , and , I warrant , a virtuous , Where is your mother ?
How now , who calls ?
Thy husband in thy bosom there lies dead , And Paris too .
If e'er thou wast thyself and these woes thine , Thou and these woes were all for Rosaline .
Here lies the county slain , And Juliet bleeding , warm and newly dead , Who here hath lain these two days buried. , Go , tell the Prince .
You know not how to choose a man .
So ho !
Nay , he will answer the letter's master , how he dares , being dared .
Ascend her chamber , hence , and comfort her .
Will you pluck your sword out of his pilcher by the ears ?
Stand up .
Thus from my lips , by thine , my sin is purged .
The other did not so .
O woeful sympathy , Piteous predicament !
Have not saints lips , and holy palmers too ?
Whose house ?
God in heaven bless her !
Well get you gone .
Come , come with me , and we will make short work .
Go waken Juliet .
And private in his chamber pens himself , Shuts up his windows , locks fair daylight out , And makes himself an artificial night .
Famine is in thy cheeks .
Sole monarch of the universal earth , Oh , what a beast was I to chide at him !
Alive in triumph , and Mercutio slain !
Ay , let the county take you in your bed .
Then I will give you the serving creature .
Tush , thou art deceived .
Art thou gone so , love , lord ?
Father , what news ?
Make haste , I say .
If love be blind , love can not hit the mark .
An thou make minstrels of us , look to hear nothing but discords .
She's not fourteen .
O Lord , they fight !
Not having that which , having , makes them short .
This bud of love , by summer's ripening breath , May prove a beauteous flower when next we meet .
O brother Montague , give me thy hand .
What hast thou found ?
Forget to think of her .
Cast it off !
Lady , come from that nest Of death , contagion , and unnatural sleep .
Or did I dream it so ?
Thy Juliet is alive , For whose dear sake thou wast but lately dead , There art thou happy .
Will it not be ?
Come you to make confession to this Father ?
By my heel , I care not .
I met the youthful lord at Lawrence ' cell , And gave him what becomed love I might , Not stepping o'er the bounds of modesty .
I must another way To fetch a ladder , by the which your love Must climb a bird's nest soon when it is dark .
O , tell me , Friar , tell me , In what vile part of this anatomy Doth my name lodge ?
Now art thou sociable .
I will follow you .
You say well .
Anon !
What further woe conspires against mine age ?
I will go call the watch .
Can you not conceive ?
Stay , then .
Hence , and stand aloof .
Here were the servants of your adversary , And yours , close fighting ere I did approach .
An you be mine , I'll give you to my friend .
Art thou so bare and full of wretchedness , And fear'st to die ?
Oh , mickle is the powerful grace that lies In herbs , plants , stones , and their true qualities .
Am I like such a fellow ?
But now , my lord , what say you to my suit ?
Death , that hath sucked the honey of thy breath , Hath had no power yet upon thy beauty .
My child , my only life , Revive , look up , or I will die with thee ! , Help , help !
This night I hold an old accustomed feast , Whereto I have invited many a guest Such as I love .
They call for dates and quinces in the pastry .
I can read .
Go , sirrah , trudge about Through fair Verona .
Marry , 'tis enough .
Madam !
O flesh , flesh , how art thou fishified !
Is my father well ?
Therefore thy kinsmen are no stop to me .
Ay , ay , the cords .
The earth , that's nature's mother , is her tomb .
For what purpose , love ?
Go thy ways , wench .
Am I come near ye now ? , Welcome , gentlemen !
Seigneur Martino and his wife and daughters ; County Anselme and his beauteous sisters ; The lady widow of Vitruvio ; Seigneur Placentio and his lovely nieces ; Mercutio and his brother Valentine ; Mine uncle Capulet , his wife and daughters ; My fair niece Rosaline and Livia ;
He ran this way and leapt this orchard wall .
These times of woe afford no time to woo .
Lie thou there .
Shame come to Romeo !
Heaven and yourself Had part in this fair maid .
Did ever dragon keep so fair a cave ?
That "banished , " that one word "banished" Hath slain ten thousand Tybalts .
Be patient , for the world is broad and wide .
Now comes the wanton blood up in your cheeks .
Monday !
Stand , an you be a man .
Of love ?
What man art thou that , thus bescreened in night , So stumblest on my counsel ?
It did , it did .
Wednesday is tomorrow .
You shall find me apt enough to that , sir , an you will give me occasion .
I'll send to one in Mantua , Where that same banished runagate doth live , Shall give him such an unaccustomed dram That he shall soon keep Tybalt company .
I am not I if there be such an Or those eyes shut that makes thee answer "ay." If he be slain , say "ay , " or if not , "no." Brief sounds determine of my weal or woe .
A braggart , a rogue , a villain that fights by the book of arithmetic !
Look , and thou shalt see .
Be ruled by me .
I am not here .
I will hence tonight .
Upon his brow shame is ashamed to sit , For 'tis a throne where honor may be crowned .
But by and by comes back to Romeo , Who had but newly entertained revenge , And to 't they go like lightning , for ere I Could draw to part them was stout Tybalt slain .
O calm dishonourable , vile submission !
Arms , take your last embrace .
You will not then ?
O God , she comes. , O honey Nurse , what news ?
Come , vial .
What is the matter ?
That may be , sir , when I may be a wife .
O God's lady dear , Are you so hot ?
This doth not so , for she divideth us .
And trust me , love , in my eye so do you .
And then , I hope , thou wilt be satisfied .
You tallow face !
Some grief shows much of love , But much of grief shows still some want of wit .
Welcome , gentlemen !
Do not answer me .
I would the fool were married to her grave !
I will show myself a tyrant .
Thou know'st the mask of night is on my face , Else would a maiden blush bepaint my cheek For that which thou hast heard me speak tonight .
What , ho ?
Thou wilt quarrel with a man for cracking nuts , having no other reason but because thou hast hazel eyes .
Out , you green sickness , carrion !
I do but keep the peace .
I will kiss thy lips .
But , I'll warrant you , when I say so , she looks as pale as any clout in the versal world .
Who calls so loud ?
And to sink in it , should you burthen love , Too great oppression for a tender thing .
Hast thou not a word of joy ?
Ay , marry , go , I say , and fetch him hither. , Now , afore God , this reverend holy friar !
Where are the vile beginners of this fray ?
Therefore , have done .
Why , she is within .
No , coz , I rather weep .
She speaks , yet she says nothing .
The bridegroom he is come already .
O , pardon me for bringing these ill news , Since you did leave it for my office , sir .
Peter !
I wot well where he is .
Tis all one .
God shield I should disturb devotion ! , Juliet , on Thursday early will I rouse ye .
Give me a torch .
Do as thou wilt , for I have done with thee .
What , Nurse , I say !
Talk not to me , for I'll not speak a word .
Their course of love , the tidings of her death .
Muffle me , night , awhile .
Ay , those attires are best .
What cursed foot wanders this way tonight To cross my obsequies and true love's rite ?
Why , bride !
I do defy thy commination And apprehend thee for a felon here .
Younger than you Here in Verona , ladies of esteem Are made already mothers .
How silver-sweet sound lovers ' tongues by night , Like softest music to attending ears !
What , art thou drawn among these heartless hinds ?
O my brother's child !
How shall that faith return again to earth , Unless that husband send it me from heaven By leaving earth ?
No , not he , though his face be better than any man's , yet his leg excels all men's , and for a hand and a foot and a body , though they be not to be talked on , yet they are past compare .
What must be shall be .
The slip , sir , the slip .
Open the tomb .
Without his roe , like a dried herring .
Both our remedies Within thy help and holy physic lies .
Your houses !
Now , by my maidenhead at twelve year old I bade her come .
Romeo , Romeo , Romeo !
Holy Saint Francis , what a change is here !
I serve as good a man as you .
Henceforth I never will be Romeo .
Why , no .
Content thee , gentle coz .
Tybalt , the kinsman to old Capulet , Hath sent a letter to his father's house .
The Prince will doom thee death If thou art taken .
Here comes my man .
You'll not endure him !
Mercy but murders , pardoning those that kill .
O Friar , the damned use that word in hell .
Let me be ta'en .
I am the youngest of that name , for fault of a worse .
My sword , I say !
O woeful time .
I will then give it you soundly .
Where I have learned me to repent the sin Of disobedient opposition To you and your behests , and am enjoined By holy Lawrence to fall prostrate here To beg your pardon .
Now , by Saint Peter's Church and Peter too , He shall not make me there a joyful bride .
Out , you baggage !
That "may be" must be , love , on Thursday next .
What , ho !
Tybalt , that murderer , which way ran he ?
To answer that , I should confess to you .
O most wicked fiend !
One fairer than my love ?
Farewell .
Why should you fall into so deep an O ?
I will bite thee by the ear for that jest .
Tut , I have lost myself .
What can he say in this ?
Not I , unless the breath of heartsick groans , Mistlike , infold me from the search of eyes .
These happy masks that kiss fair ladies ' brows , Being black , puts us in mind they hide the fair .
How hast thou the heart , Being a divine , a ghostly confessor , A sin-absolver , and my friend professed , To mangle me with that word "banished" ?
What , mistress !
Hie , make haste , Make haste .
My wits faints .
Would I were sleep and peace , so sweet to rest .
This wind you talk of , blows us from ourselves .
Go , girl , seek happy nights to happy days .
Bondage is hoarse , and may not speak aloud , Else would I tear the cave where Echo lies , And make her airy tongue more hoarse than mine , With repetition of "My Romeo ! " It is my soul that calls upon my name .
You say you do not know the lady's mind .
Welcome from Mantua .
Thou shalt be loggerhead. , Good faith , 'tis day .
Go ask his name. , If he be married .
I have watched ere now All night for lesser cause , and ne'er been sick .
What is yond gentleman ?
Look you , she loved her kinsman Tybalt dearly , And so did I .
Nay , I'll conjure too !
This is the truth , or let Benvolio die .
Thus with a kiss I die .
Stand not amazed .
Was ever book containing such vile matter So fairly bound ?
O Juliet , I already know thy grief .
Anon !
Two such opposed kings encamp them still , In man as well as herbs , grace and rude will .
Then have at thee , boy !
Zounds , a dog , a rat , a mouse , a cat to scratch a man to death !
I beseech you , follow straight .
Will you speak well of him that killed your cousin ?
Marry , I will , and this is wisely done .
And there she shall at Friar Lawrence ' cell Be shrived and married .
Do not deny to him that you love me .
How now ?
I would thou hadst my bones and I thy news .
I would I were thy bird .
Yea , is the worst well ?
Prates too. , What say you , James Soundpost ?
What say you ?
Then I'll be brief .
Nurse , will you go with me into my closet To help me sort such needful ornaments As you think fit to furnish me tomorrow ?
Can heaven be so envious ?
I will be gone , sir , and not trouble you .
I'll be with thee straight .
Though news be sad , yet tell them merrily .
I am none of his flirt-gills .
And yet thou wilt tutor me from quarreling !
Why , lady !
But I pray , can you read anything you see ?
I will be deaf to pleading and excuses .
Say thou but "ay , " And that bare vowel Than the death-darting eye of cockatrice .
Oh , the people in the street cry "Romeo , " Some "Juliet , " and some "Paris , " and all run With open outcry toward our monument .
Tis now near night .
Very well took , i ' faith , wisely , wisely .
Come , come away .
Oh , then I see that madmen have no ears .
Now , ere the sun advance his burning eye , The day to cheer and night's dank dew to dry , I must upfill this osier cage of ours With baleful weeds and precious-juiced flowers .
Hold , then .
If in thy wisdom thou canst give no help , Do thou but call my resolution wise , And with this knife I'll help it presently .
Tis torture and not mercy .
O rude unthankfulness !
Here comes the furious Tybalt back again .
My life were better ended by their hate Than death prorogued , wanting of thy love .
Therefore he that can not lick his fingers goes not with me .
Let them affright thee .
I like it not .
Thy wit is a very bitter sweeting .
Her vestal livery is but sick and green , And none but fools do wear it .
Not I , believe me .
Sin from thy lips ?
More light and light it grows .
An he speak any thing against me , I'll take him down , an he were lustier than he is , and twenty such Jacks .
Your part in her you could not keep from death , But heaven keeps his part in eternal life .
A right good markman !
We'll to dinner , thither .
Her lord is come .
I would have made it short , for I was come to the whole depth of my tale , and meant , indeed , to occupy the argument no longer .
Art thou a man ?
Couple it with something .
It is the lark that sings so out of tune , Straining harsh discords and unpleasing sharps .
Hast thou no letters to me from the friar ?
To supper ?
Blistered be thy tongue For such a wish !
Make haste , lest mine be about your ears ere it be out .
I stretch it out for that word "broad , " which , added to the goose , proves thee far and wide a broad goose .
It makes me mad .
Let me see her .
Would none but I might venge my cousin's death !
What wouldst thou have with me ?
Romeo slew Tybalt .
And where the worser is predominant , Full soon the canker death eats up that plant .
Courage , man .
Speakest thou from thy heart ?
News from Verona ! , How now , Balthasar ?
But woo her , gentle Paris , get her heart .
Go thither , and with unattainted eye Compare her face with some that I shall show , And I will make thee think thy swan a crow .
Yet let me weep for such a feeling loss .
Thou art not conquered .
Hark you , sir .
Give me , give me !
Who is it ?
A plague o ' both your houses !
I will be brief , for my short date of breath Is not so long as is a tedious tale .
Seal up the mouth of outrage for a while , Till we can clear these ambiguities And know their spring , their head , their true descent , And then will I be general of your woes , And lead you even to death .
An I were so apt to quarrel as thou art , any man should buy the fee simple of my life for an hour and a quarter .
I know thou wilt say "ay , " And I will take thy word .
Flies may do this , but I from this must fly .
My master's .
Madam , I am here .
Tybalt , my cousin !
O love !
I drink to thee .
O God ! , O Nurse , how shall this be prevented ?
This trick may chance to scathe you , I know what .
Now is he for the numbers that Petrarch flowed in .
Howling attends it .
Accursed , unhappy , wretched , hateful day !
And I'll still stay , to have thee still forget , Forgetting any other home but this .
Speak , nephew .
Vile earth , to earth resign .
And all the better is it for the maid .
Stay not , be gone .
I would not for the wealth of all the town Here in my house do him disparagement .
I am afeard , Being in night , all this is but a dream , Too flattering sweet to be substantial .
My dearest cousin and my dearer lord ?
He'll fright you up , i ' faith .
I hear some noise within .
To prison , eyes , ne'er look on liberty .
The hurt can not be much .
Thou wast never with me for anything when thou wast not there for the goose .
But no more deep will I endart mine eye Than your consent gives strength to make it fly .
He is hid at Lawrence ' cell .
Out on her , hilding !
Come between us , good Benvolio .
Can you not stay awhile ?
Ha , banishment !
Come , thou day in night , For thou wilt lie upon the wings of night Whiter than new snow upon a raven's back .
The cords That Romeo bid thee fetch ?
Romeo ! , Alack , alack , what blood is this , which stains The stony entrance of the sepulcher ?
There is no world without Verona walls But purgatory , torture , hell itself .
Beshrew my very heart , I think you are happy in this second match , For it excels your first .
What should it be that is so shrieked abroad ?

Is your man secret ?
Therefore , farewell .
A sick man in sadness makes his will , A word ill urged to one that is so ill .
Be fickle , fortune , For then , I hope , thou wilt not keep him long , But send him back .
No warmth , no breath shall testify thou livest .
They'll be in scarlet straight at any news .
That shall she .
Your plantain leaf is excellent for that .
Let me be satisfied .
Death is my son-in-law .
Romeo shall thank thee , daughter , for us both .
The ground is bloody. , Search about the churchyard .
Saw you him today ?
O woe !
And art thou changed ?
The date is out of such prolixity .
Nurse , commend me to thy lady and mistress .
What , drawn , and talk of peace ?
What shall I swear by ?
Oh , she is lame !
And she as much in love , her means much less To meet her new beloved anywhere .
Your looks are pale and wild , and do import Some misadventure .
What , shall this speech be spoke for our excuse ?
You'll be sick tomorrow For this night's watching .
Madam , if you could find out but a man To bear a poison , I would temper it , That Romeo should , upon receipt thereof , Soon sleep in quiet .
Have you got leave to go to shrift today ?
What , shall I groan and tell thee ?
A conduit , girl ?
But sadly , tell me who .
Groan !
Good night .
My invocation Is fair and honest .
Send for the county .
Raise up the Montagues .
What noise is here ?
The day is broke .
But new struck nine .
Were you by when it began ?
They are free men , but I am banished .
I will confess to you that I love him .
Romeo , away , be gone !
From forth the fatal loins of these two foes A pair of star-crossed lovers take their life , Whose misadventured piteous overthrows Doth with their death bury their parents ' strife .
It is some meteor that the sun exhales To be to thee this night a torchbearer , And light thee on thy way to Mantua .
How , will she none ?
I pray , sir , can you read ?
What a man are you ?
I'll to the friar to know his remedy .
No , my good lord .
And , pretty fool , it stinted and said "ay." Enough of this .
Methinks I see thee now , thou art so low As one dead in the bottom of a tomb .
That's not so .
Young men's love then lies Not truly in their hearts , but in their eyes .
More light and light , more dark and dark our woes !
A great suspicion .
Lo , here upon thy cheek the stain doth sit Of an old tear that is not washed off yet .
And here stands all your state : Either be gone before the watch be set , Or by the break of day disguised from hence .
Why , may one ask ?
Romeo will answer it .
Go , then , for 'tis in vain To seek him here that means not to be found .
What counterfeit did I give you ?
At this same ancient feast of Capulet's Sups the fair Rosaline whom thou so loves With all the admired beauties of Verona .
There is time enough .
Come forth , thou fearful man .
Ah , my back , my back !
Lay hand on heart , advise .
Is Rosaline , whom thou didst love so dear , So soon forsaken ?
Go , get thee to thy love , as was decreed .
Is she not proud ?
Yes , madam .
Young son , it argues a distempered head So soon to bid good morrow to thy bed .
Send thy man away .
It is too rough , Too rude , too boisterous , and it pricks like thorn .
God mark thee to his grace !
Here , sir , a ring she bid me give you , sir .
Here's one , a friend , and one that knows you well .
Peace , ho , for shame !
Thursday is near .
I do bite my thumb , sir .
Some others search .
Despised , distressed , hated , martyred , killed !
Didst thou not fall out with a tailor for wearing his new doublet before Easter ?
That's a certain text .
Ay , by my troth , the case may be amended .
Find thou the means , and I'll find such a man .
But , as I said , On Lammas Eve at night shall she be fourteen .
Farewell , farewell .
Peace , you mumbling fool !
I'll to him .
What o'clock tomorrow Shall I send to thee ?
Why dost thou stay ?
I'll go alone .
Hold him in safety till the Prince come hither .
Montague !
Hie you , make haste , for it grows very late .
Not proud you have , but thankful that you have .
Your mother .
Adieu , adieu !
Where's Potpan , that he helps not to take away ?
I saw her laid low in her kindred's vault And presently took post to tell it you .
And here I stand , both to impeach and purge , Myself condemned and myself excused .
I'll not to bed tonight .
I pray you , tell my lord and father , madam , I will not marry yet .
What if this mixture do not work at all ?
A man , young lady !
Ah , Juliet , if the measure of thy joy Be heaped like mine , and that thy skill be more To blazon it , then sweeten with thy breath This neighbor air , and let rich music's tongue Unfold the imagined happiness that both Receive in either by this dear encounter .
Dear love , adieu. , Anon , good Nurse ! , Sweet Montague , be true .
No , 'tis not so deep as a well nor so wide as a church-door , but 'tis enough , 'twill serve .
Is 't so , indeed ?
And why , my Lady Wisdom ?
I beg for justice , which thou , Prince , must give .
It is my lady .
Come , stir , stir , stir !
I gave thee mine before thou didst request it , And yet I would it were to give again .
Was I with you there for the goose ?
Not a dump , we .
Come , what says Romeo ?
Look , love , what envious streaks Do lace the severing clouds in yonder east .
Ha , ha .
Therefore love moderately .
And is he a man to encounter Tybalt ?
We are undone , lady , we are undone !
Faith , we may put up our pipes and be gone .
Thou wouldst else have made thy tale large .
Sometime she gallops o'er a courtier's nose , And then dreams he of smelling out a suit .
You must contrary me .
Ah , where's my man ? , Give me some aqua vitae. , These griefs , these woes , these sorrows make me old .
Good morrow , cousin .
What , lamb !
Let's see for means .
I bear no hatred , blessed man , for , lo , My intercession likewise steads my foe .
I hate the word , As I hate hell , all Montagues , and thee .
So will ye , I am sure , that you love me .
Who knocks so hard ?
Life and these lips have long been separated .
God 'i ' good e'en .
I would forget it fain , But oh , it presses to my memory , Like damned guilty deeds to sinners ' minds .
Do you quarrel , sir ?
What less than doomsday is the Prince's doom ?
Saints do not move , though grant for prayers ' sake .
Men's eyes were made to look and let them gaze .
The gray-eyed morn smiles on the frowning night , Checkering the eastern clouds with streaks of light , And fleckled darkness like a drunkard reels From forth day's path and Titan's fiery wheels .
The curfew bell hath rung .
Tell me not , Friar , that thou hear'st of this , Unless thou tell me how I may prevent it .
As I did sleep under this yew tree here , I dreamt my master and another fought , And that my master slew him .
The citizens are up , and Tybalt slain .
Here comes the lady .
Oh , God 'i ' good e'en .
I have forgot why I did call thee back .
This sight of death is as a bell , That warns my old age to a sepulcher .
The son and heir of old Tiberio .
Could you not take some occasion without giving ?
Younger than she are happy mothers made .
I'll lay fourteen of my teeth , and yet , to my teen be it spoken , I have but four , she is not fourteen .
The second cock hath crowed .
But I'll amerce you with so strong a fine That you shall all repent the loss of mine .
Sweet , sweet , sweet Nurse , tell me , what says my love ?
You are too hot .
That's my good son .
Dost thou love me ?
No , no .
A madness most discreet , A choking gall , and a preserving sweet .
Thou need'st not to be gone .
Say either , and I'll stay the circumstance .
Ay , mine own fortune in my misery .
Thy face is mine , and thou hast slandered it .
Good Father , I beseech you on my knees , Hear me with patience but to speak a word .
Here , here will I remain With worms that are thy chamber maids .
I dare not , sir .
By my troth , it is well said .
You lie .
Oh , then , I see Queen Mab hath been with you .
I'll find out your man , And he shall signify from time to time Every good hap to you that chances here .
Is it good e'en ?
Tybalt's death Was woe enough , if it had ended there .
I have a head , sir , that will find out logs , And never trouble Peter for the matter .
Dry sorrow drinks our blood .
I have it , And soundly too .
Nay , good goose , bite not .
Madam , I am not well .
Well , Juliet , I will lie with thee tonight .
Most detestable Death , by thee beguiled , By cruel , cruel thee quite overthrown !
Go tell him of this .
Buy food , and get thyself in flesh. , Come , cordial and not poison , go with me To Juliet's grave , for there must I use thee .
Is it e'en so ?
Farewell ! , God knows when we shall meet again .
Thou know'st my daughter's of a pretty age .
Or , if sour woe delights in fellowship And needly will be ranked with other griefs , Why followed not , when she said "Tybalt's dead , " "Thy father" or "thy mother , " nay , or both , Which modern lamentations might have moved ?
Come , civil night , Thou sober-suited matron , all in black , And learn me how to lose a winning match Played for a pair of stainless maidenhoods .
With Rosaline , my ghostly Father ?
Ay me , what news ?
My bounty is as boundless as the sea , My love as deep .
Tis no time to play now .
Both with an Ah , mocker , that's the dog's name .
Why Romeo , art thou mad ?
Hie you to church .
The boy gives warning something doth approach .
A pack of blessings light upon thy back , Happiness courts thee in her best array ,
Commend me to thy mistress .
Either withdraw unto some private place , And reason coldly of your grievances , Or else depart .
Where is my page ? , Go , villain , fetch a surgeon .
I see that thou art poor .
Scurvy knave !
Honest Nurse , farewell .
Get thee gone , And hire those horses .
He speaks not true .
O woeful , woeful , woeful day !
The world is not thy friend nor the world's law .
Where is my father and my mother , Nurse ?
If good , thou shamest the music of sweet news By playing it to me with so sour a face .
Faith , I can tell her age unto an hour .
No words can that woe sound .
This is she , Peace , peace , Mercutio , peace !
Thou shalt not stir one foot to seek a foe .
There lies that Tybalt .
Oh , he is even in my mistress ' case , Just in her case .
Ay , forsooth .
As if that name , Shot from the deadly level of a gun , Did murder her , as that name's cursed hand Murdered her kinsman .
Oh , thou wilt speak again of banishment .
What , art thou hurt ?
Death is my heir .
Oh , in this love , you love your child so ill That you run mad , seeing that she is well .
She's dead , she's dead , she's dead !
Comfort me .
Oh , think'st thou we shall ever meet again ?
O Lord , I could have stayed here all the night To hear good counsel .
Do you not see that I am out of breath ?
A merry whoreson , ha !
Farewell .
Then weep no more .
Help me into some house , Benvolio , Or I shall faint .
Sir Paris , I will make a desperate tender Of my child's love .
Go in , and tell my lady I am gone , Having displeased my father , to Lawrence's cell To make confession and to be absolved .
But passion lends them power , time means , to meet , Tempering extremities with extreme sweet .
What are they , beseech your ladyship ?
Beguiled , divorced , wronged , spited , slain !
Susan and she , God rest all Christian souls ! , Were of an age .
Here's drink .
Our solemn hymns to sullen dirges change , Our bridal flowers serve for a buried corse , And all things change them to the contrary .
Let me alone .
Spakest thou of Juliet ?
How oft tonight Have my old feet stumbled at graves ! , Who's there ?
There stays a husband to make you a wife .
What , not a word ?
Friends , part ! " and , swifter than his tongue , His agile arm beats down their fatal points , And 'twixt them rushes , underneath whose arm An envious thrust from Tybalt hit the life Of stout Mercutio , and then Tybalt fled .
Faith , I know not what to say .
Within the infant rind of this small flower Poison hath residence and medicine power .
As mine on hers , so hers is set on mine , And all combined , save what thou must combine By holy marriage .
Let's talk .
Well , you have made a simple choice .
An I might live to see thee married once , I have my wish .
What is your will ?
See how she leans her cheek upon her hand .
A plague o ' both your houses !
Happily met , my lady and my wife .
Well , sir .
I am too sore enpierced with his shaft To soar with his light feathers , and so bound , I can not bound a pitch above dull woe .
O , be gone !
Why , is not this better now than groaning for love ?
I see thou know'st me not .
Well , thou hast comforted me marvelous much .
I will omit no opportunity That may convey my greetings , love , to thee .
Ah sir , ah sir .
O , wilt thou leave me so unsatisfied ?
Tis twenty year till then .
He was not born to shame .
Come , come , thou art as hot a Jack in thy mood as any in Italy , and as soon moved to be moody , and as soon moody to be moved .
I bring thee tidings of the Prince's doom .
We'll keep no great ado , a friend or two .
Romeo , come forth .
Good night .
Our whole city is much bound to him .
Make haste , make haste , sirrah .
Shake ! " quoth the dovehouse .
How art thou out of breath when thou hast breath To say to me that thou art out of breath ?
That villain cousin would have killed my husband .
How should they , when that wise men have no eyes ?
Where is my lord ?
There lies the man , slain by young Romeo , That slew thy kinsman , brave Mercutio .
Wouldst thou withdraw it ?
To our house .
Tell me in sadness , who is that you love .
Was that my father that went hence so fast ?
Strike !
My nyas ?
Grief of my son's exile hath stopped her breath .
Come , we burn daylight , ho !
Or if not so , then here I hit it right : Our Romeo hath not been in bed tonight .
We found him in the churchyard .
Away , Tybalt .
And joy comes well in such a needy time .
I speak no treason .
Tomorrow night look that thou lie alone .
Good heart , at what ?
O me !
Right glad I am he was not at this fray .
Well , girl , thou weep'st not so much for his death , As that the villain lives which slaughtered him .
Switch and spurs , switch and spurs , or I'll cry a match .
But come , young waverer , come , go with me , In one respect I'll thy assistant be , For this alliance may so happy prove To turn your households ' rancor to pure love .
My leisure serves me , pensive daughter , now. , My lord , we must entreat the time alone .
Alas , my liege , my wife is dead tonight .
I have .
Ready to go , but never to return .
Chopped logic !
Need you my help ?
Ay , you have been a mouse-hunt in your time , But I will watch you from such watching now .
To move is to stir , and to be valiant is to stand .
Ask for me tomorrow , and you shall find me a grave man .
So thrive my soul , A thousand times good night !
God ye good e'en , fair gentlewoman .
But to be frank , and give it thee again .
O life !
Good morrow to you both .
I pray thee , hold thy peace .
The strangers all are gone .
But let them measure us by what they will .
Parting is such sweet sorrow That I shall say good night till it be morrow .
Never was seen so black a day as this .
Hie you to the cell .
Then have at you with my wit .
I tell you , he that can lay hold of her Shall have the chinks .
It is "music with her silver sound" because musicians have no gold for sounding .
I protest unto thee , Good heart , and i ' faith , I will tell her as much .
Romeo slew him ; he slew Mercutio .
The sun not yet thy sighs from heaven clears , Thy old groans ring yet in my ancient ears .
Bliss be upon you !
The all-seeing sun Ne'er saw her match since first the world begun .
The clock struck nine when I did send the Nurse .
Romeo's a dishclout to him .
I am not for this ambling .
Romeo , will you come to your father's ?
What ?
She is too fair , too wise , wisely too fair , To merit bliss by making me despair .
That I ask again , For nothing can be ill if she be well .
Stay , Tybalt , stay !
Hie to high fortune !
Wilt thou not , Jule ? " It stinted and said "ay." And stint thou too , I pray thee , Nurse , say I .
O God , did Romeo's hand shed Tybalt's blood ?
Away with the joint-stools , remove the court-cupboard , look to the plate .
All men call thee fickle .
O comfortable Friar !
Brother , I'll go and bring it thee .
By a name I know not how to tell thee who I am .
Thou canst not speak of that thou dost not feel .
What unaccustomed cause procures her hither ?
Be trusty , and I'll quit thy pains .
What satisfaction canst thou have tonight ?
Thou villain Capulet !
I dreamt a dream tonight .
I'll tell thee ere thou ask it me again .
And weep ye now , seeing she is advanced Above the clouds , as high as heaven itself ?
That last is true .
Riddling confession finds but riddling shrift .
I am none of his skains-mates .
Why rail'st thou on thy birth , the heaven , and earth ?
I would thou wert so happy by thy stay To hear true shrift. , Come , madam , let's away .
Put up thy sword , Or manage it to part these men with me .
Thou , why , thou wilt quarrel with a man that hath a hair more or a hair less in his beard than thou hast .
Our instruments to melancholy bells , Our wedding cheer to a sad burial feast .
Why , how now , Juliet ?
He is wise , And , on my life , hath stol'n him home to bed .
For I ne'er saw true beauty till this night .
O wife , look how our daughter bleeds !
But saying o'er what I have said before .
Not life , but love in death .
But where unbruised youth with unstuffed brain Doth couch his limbs , there golden sleep doth reign .
Oh , let us hence .
But come what sorrow can , It can not countervail the exchange of joy That one short minute gives me in her sight .
Nay , gentlemen , prepare not to be gone .
O Romeo , Romeo !
Madam , in happy time , what day is that ?
For doting , not for loving , pupil mine .
Warrant thee , my man's as true as steel .
Your love says , like an honest gentleman , 'Where is your mother ?
Now is the sun upon the highmost hill Of this day's journey , and from nine till twelve Is three long hours , yet she is not come .
Tis but thy name that is my enemy .
Dead art thou !
What said my man , when my betossed soul Did not attend him as we rode ?
Weeping and wailing over Tybalt's corse .
O serpent heart hid with a flowering face !
We took this mattock and this spade from him As he was coming from this churchyard's side .
Marry , that , I think , be young Petruchio .
O cousin , cousin !
While we were interchanging thrusts and blows , Came more and more and fought on part and part , Till the Prince came , who parted either part .
Nay , that's not so .
In love ?
Marry , sir , because silver hath a sweet sound .
Good even to my ghostly confessor .
Get me ink and paper , And hire post horses .
Here's Romeo's man .
This torture should be roared in dismal hell .
Or shall we on without apology ?
Well , well , thou hast a careful father , child .
Why , love , I say .
Wherefore art thou Romeo ?
By'r Lady , thirty years .
Alas , poor Romeo !
Reply not .
Oh , by this count I shall be much in years Ere I again behold my Romeo .
For shame , bring Juliet forth .
That same villain , Romeo .
I nursed her daughter that you talked withal .
Commend me to thy lady .
Here's goodly gear .
Tonight she is mewed up to her heaviness .
Mass , and well said .
Be brisk 0awhile , and the longer liver take all .
Go to , go to .
Love give me strength , and strength shall help afford .
Mine shall be spent When theirs are dry , for Romeo's banishment .
Where is my Romeo ?
Stay the friar too .
But one , poor one , one poor and loving child , But one thing to rejoice and solace in , And cruel death hath catched it from my sight !
Beat them down !
And sometime comes she with a tithe-pig's tail Tickling a parson's nose as he lies asleep , Then he dreams of another benefice .
My naked weapon is out .
She that makes dainty , She , I'll swear , hath corns .
Tis not to me she speaks .
Think upon these gone .
Go .
Where the devil should this Romeo be ?
Ah , welladay !
Old Montague is come , And flourishes his blade in spite of me .
We'll to church tomorrow .
O , what more favor can I do to thee , Than with that hand that cut thy youth in twain To sunder his that was thine enemy ?
For himself to mar , " quoth he ?
I was hurt under your arm .
Nurse !
Tybalt is gone , and Romeo banished .
Oh , no .
Therefore we'll have some half a dozen friends , And there an end .
Sweet-heart !
Thou chid'st me oft for loving Rosaline .
I will say for you .
Do you bite your thumb at us , sir ?
All this is comfort .
Ay , if I know the letters and the language .
Take thou that .
Now I'll tell you without asking .
Tell me , good my friend , What torch is yond that vainly lends his light To grubs and eyeless skulls ?
Ay , madam , from the reach of these my hands .
On Thursday , sir ?
Let them begin .
Thy wild acts denote The unreasonable fury of a beast .
You shall have none ill , sir , for I'll try if they can lick their fingers .
And stay , good Nurse .
Come , death , and welcome !
How long hath he been there ?
His son was but a ward two years ago .
My lord , I would that Thursday were tomorrow .
Answer me like men .
If all else fail , myself have power to die .
I will die , And leave him all .
Yet I can not choose but laugh To think it should leave crying and say "ay." And yet , I warrant , it had upon its brow A bump as big as a young cockerel's stone , A perilous knock , and it cried bitterly .
I am content , so thou wilt have it so .
Here all eyes gaze on us .
Things have fall'n out , sir , so unluckily , That we have had no time to move our daughter .
The quarrel is between our masters and us their men .
Have you importuned him by any means ?
Full half an hour .
Either my eyesight fails , or thou look'st pale .
Farewell !
Even such delight Among fresh fennel buds shall you this night Inherit at my house .
One kiss , and I'll descend .
I'll to dinner .
Then I defy you , stars !
So shalt thou show me friendship .
On , lusty gentlemen .
Now must I to the monument alone .
I pray thee , good Mercutio , let's retire .
Some say the lark makes sweet division .
I will , and know her mind early tomorrow .
Good thou , save me a piece of marchpane , and , as thou loves me , let the porter let in Susan Grindstone and Nell. , Antony and Potpan !
In bed asleep while they do dream things true .
Before and apace .
The most you sought was her promotion , For 'twas your heaven she should be advanced .
Rest you merry !
But now I'll tell thee joyful tidings , girl .
Fie , how my bones ache !
Her blood is settled , and her joints are stiff .
I'll go along , no such sight to be shown , But to rejoice in splendor of mine own .
What , are you busy , ho ?
Dove-feathered raven , wolvish-ravening lamb !
Indeed , I should have asked thee that before .
I'll play the housewife for this once .
But with a rearward following Tybalt's death , "Romeo is banished." To speak that word , Is father , mother , Tybalt , Romeo , Juliet , All slain , all dead .
Romeo !
As I discern , It burneth in the Capels ' monument .
Feeling so the loss , Can not choose but ever weep the friend .
We talk here in the public haunt of men .
Either thou or I , or both , must go with him .
But wherefore , villain , didst thou kill my cousin ?
Do not say "banishment." Hence from Verona art thou banished .
Poor living corse , closed in a dead man's tomb !
Nor tears nor prayers shall purchase out abuses , Therefore use none .
Two , two , a shirt and a smock .
She's dead , deceased , she's dead .
I have more care to stay than will to go .
Have you delivered to her our decree ?
Behind the abbey wall Within this hour my man shall be with thee And bring thee cords made like a tackled stair , Which to the high top-gallant of my joy Must be my convoy in the secret night .
Thou fond mad man , hear me a little speak .
Villain am I none .
Wilt thou be gone ?
What says he of our marriage ?
Nay , an there were two such , we should have none shortly , for one would kill the other .
Hang him , Jack !
O , teach me how I should forget to think !
One , gentlewoman , that God hath made , himself to mar .
Oh , so light a foot Will ne'er wear out the everlasting flint .
You are a lover .
Give me those flowers .
Oh , where is Romeo ?
I am hurt .
I know not , sir .
Romeo , he cries aloud , "Hold , friends !
Then hie you hence to Friar Lawrence's cell .
Go , be gone .
What of that ?
Although I joy in thee , I have no joy of this contract tonight .
We follow thee. , Juliet , the county stays .
What wilt thou tell her , Nurse ?
For what , I pray thee ?
Even so lies she , Blubbering and weeping , weeping and blubbering .
What is her mother ?
Meantime I writ to Romeo , That he should hither come as this dire night , To help to take her from her borrowed grave , Being the time the potion's force should cease .
Did you ne'er hear say , "Two may keep counsel , putting one away" ?
And what says My concealed lady to our canceled love ?
Is love a tender thing ?
I'll bury thee in a triumphant grave .
Amen , amen .
Long love doth so .
One knocks .
Oh , much I fear some ill unthrifty thing .
Serve God .
The heavens do lour upon you for some ill. Move them no more by crossing their high will .
Madam , your mother craves a word with you .
O woeful day , O woeful day !
Out .
Care keeps his watch in every old man's eye , And where care lodges , sleep will never lie .
There rust and let me die .
Yon light is not daylight , I know it , I .
Talk no more .
What , wilt thou wash him from his grave with tears ?
O blessed , blessed night !
Yet I should kill thee with much cherishing .
Take up those cords. , Poor ropes , you are beguiled , Both you and I , for Romeo is exiled .
Tell him so yourself , And see how he will take it at your hands .
I must hence to wait .
Hie to your chamber .
This can not anger him .
Speak but one rhyme , and I am satisfied .
Now will he sit under a medlar tree And wish his mistress were that kind of fruit As maids call medlars when they laugh alone. , O Romeo , that she were !
Fear comes upon me .
Do you like this haste ?
Borrow Cupid's wings And soar with them above a common bound .
Romeo can , Though heaven can not .
But what say you to Thursday ?
A grave ?
Or , if thou wilt , swear by thy gracious self , Which is the god of my idolatry , And I'll believe thee .
Bear hence this body and attend our will .
But old folks , many feign as they were dead , Unwieldy , slow , heavy , and pale as lead .
An if he hear thee , thou wilt anger him .
Unhappy fortune !
Thou wilt fall backward when thou comest to age .
That ever I should live to see thee dead .
It is not yet near day .
It is not day .
Why , I am glad on 't .
Yet put it out , for I would not be seen .
Come hither , Nurse .
But thou art not quickly moved to strike .
Is it my lady mother ?
Strike , drum .
Marry , my child , early next Thursday morn , The gallant , young , and noble gentleman , The County Paris , at Saint Peter's Church , Shall happily make thee there a joyful bride .
Good morrow , Father .
Yea , " quoth he , "Dost thou fall upon thy face ?
How canst thou try them so ?
The time is very short .
But I'll be hanged , sir , if he wear your livery .
And how doth she ?
Go hence .
And when I do , I swear It shall be Romeo , whom you know I hate , Rather than Paris .
Now heaven hath all ,
You have dancing shoes With nimble soles .
This is the place .
Mercutio's kinsman , noble County Paris .
He made you for a highway to my bed , But I , a maid , die maiden-widowed .
Good Romeo , hide thyself .
Now God in heaven bless thee !
Mercutio , thou consort'st with Romeo .
Day , night , hour , tide , time , work , play , Alone , in company , still my care hath been To have her matched .
Have at thee , coward !
Ah me !
You are to blame , my lord , to rate her so .
What's your will ?
I will come again .
How fares my Juliet ?
I will not budge for no man's pleasure , I .
It is an honor that I dream not of .
And she's fair I love .
O mischief , thou art swift To enter in the thoughts of desperate men !
Then have my lips the sin that they have took .
Fie , fie !
When good manners shall lie all in one or two men's hands , and they unwashed too , 'tis a foul thing .
Nurse ?
Brother , ho !
A gentleman , Nurse , that loves to hear himself talk , and will speak more in a minute than he will stand to in a month .
Madam .
He is not the flower of courtesy , but , I'll warrant him , as gentle as a lamb .
Within this three hours will fair Juliet wake .
How sound is she asleep !
Poison , I see , hath been his timeless end. , O churl , drunk all , and left no friendly drop To help me after ?
Not in a grave , To lay one in , another out to have .
Go thou to Juliet , help to deck up her .
Then she is well , and nothing can be ill .
Then , window , let day in and let life out .
Marry , I remember it well .
Under love's heavy burden do I sink .
What with a torch !
We waste our lights in vain , like lights by day .
Nay , if our wits run the wild-goose chase , I am done , for thou hast more of the wild-goose in one of thy wits than , I am sure , I have in my whole five .
This shall determine that .
And yet no further than a wanton's bird , That lets it hop a little from his hand Like a poor prisoner in his twisted gyves , And with a silken thread plucks it back again , So loving-jealous of his liberty .
My lord and you were then at Mantua. , Nay , I do bear a brain. , But , as I said , When it did taste the wormwood on the nipple Of my dug and felt it bitter , pretty fool , To see it tetchy and fall out with the dug !
She will indite him to some supper .
Down with the Montagues !
Now Romeo is beloved and loves again , Alike bewitched by the charm of looks , But to his foe supposed he must complain , And she steal love's sweet bait from fearful hooks .
His fault concludes but what the law should end , The life of Tybalt .
But I am sent to find those persons whose names are here writ , and can never find what names the writing person hath here writ .
No money , on my faith , but the gleek .
Cheerly , boys .
My master is the great rich Capulet , and if you be not of the house of Montagues , I pray come and crush a cup of wine .
And if you leave me so , you do me wrong .
I dare draw as soon as another man if I see occasion in a good quarrel and the law on my side .
Take thou some new infection to thy eye , And the rank poison of the old will die .
Every one prepare To follow this fair corse unto her grave .
Call , good Mercutio .
Where shall we dine ? , O me !
Cry but "Ay me ! " Pronounce but "love" and "dove." Speak to my gossip Venus one fair word , One nickname for her purblind son and heir , Young Abraham Cupid , he that shot so true When King Cophetua loved the beggar maid. , He heareth not , he stirreth not , he moveth not .
Give me my sin again .
Too familiar Is my dear son with such sour company .
Come hither , man .
Even or odd , of all days in the year , Come Lammas Eve at night shall she be fourteen .
Oh , that she knew she were !
I'll look to like if looking liking move .
Tell me , daughter Juliet , How stands your disposition to be married ?
More validity , More honorable state , more courtship lives In carrion flies than Romeo .
Let me stand here till thou remember it .
Utter your gravity o'er a gossip's bowl , For here we need it not .
Is he gone and hath nothing ?
Her eye in heaven Would through the airy region stream so bright That birds would sing and think it were not night .
What is it else ?
Uncle , this is a Montague , our foe , A villain that is hither come in spite To scorn at our solemnity this night .
Two of the fairest stars in all the heaven , Having some business , do entreat her eyes To twinkle in their spheres till they return .
O heavy day !
Apothecary !
O nature , what hadst thou to do in hell When thou didst bower the spirit of a fiend In moral paradise of such sweet flesh ?
Supper is done , and we shall come too late .
By the hour of nine .
That is because the traitor murderer lives .
Look , sir , here comes the lady toward my cell .
Tybalt is dead , and Romeo banished."
Hadst thou no poison mixed , no sharp-ground knife , No sudden mean of death , though ne'er so mean , But "banished" to kill me ? , "Banished" !
Farewell .
This is well .
Let not the Nurse lie with thee in thy chamber .
Go and trim her up .
Or , if his mind be writ , give me his letter .
I'll go and chat with Paris .
No .
O fortune , fortune !
What a pestilent knave is this same !
A right fair mark , fair coz , is soonest hit .
Therefore turn and draw .
Now , good sweet Nurse , O Lord , why look'st thou sad ?
And when I shall die , Take him and cut him out in little stars , And he will make the face of heaven so fine That all the world will be in love with night And pay no worship to the garish sun .
Hence will I to my ghostly friar's close cell , His help to crave and my dear hap to tell .
Hence , be gone , away !
Take no note of him .
Here comes your father .
This dagger hath mista'en , for , lo , his house Is empty on the back of Montague , And it mis-sheathed in my daughter's bosom .
Monday , my lord .
Smatter with your gossips , go .
My daughter he hath wedded .
I will carry no crotchets .
Do not swear at all .
Who bare my letter , then , to Romeo ?
Yet I will adventure .
Some comfort , Nurse .
O Romeo , Romeo , brave Mercutio is dead !
Peter , stay at the gate .
I am aweary .
It is a most sharp sauce .
Do so , and bid my sweet prepare to chide .
O ' Thursday be it , then. , Go you to Juliet ere you go to bed .
Or if it did not , Your first is dead , or 'twere as good he were , As living here and you no use of him .
Wilt thou provoke me ?
My dismal scene I needs must act alone .
A jealous hood , a jealous hood !
Let me be put to death .
Madam , good night .
It was .
If I may trust the flattering truth of sleep , My dreams presage some joyful news at hand .
My child is yet a stranger in the world .
Ay , pilgrim , lips that they must use in prayer .
Come , I'll dispose of thee Among a sisterhood of holy nuns .
Spare not for the cost .
Amen !
Thou dost not mark me .
In sadness , cousin , I do love a woman .
They pray ; grant thou , lest faith turn to despair .
Poor soul , thy face is much abused with tears .
Art thou not Romeo , and a Montague ?
I anger her sometimes and tell her that Paris is the properer man .
Oh , that I were a glove upon that hand That I might touch that cheek !
Many a morning hath he there been seen , With tears augmenting the fresh morning's dew , Adding to clouds more clouds with his deep sighs .
Let wantons light of heart Tickle the senseless rushes with their heels .
Then say at once what thou dost know in this .
Yea , " quoth my husband , "Fall'st upon thy face ?
Proud , " and "I thank you , " and "I thank you not , " And yet "not proud" ?
And so did I .
Give me thy torch , boy .
And so , good Capulet , which name I tender As dearly as my own , be satisfied .
What devil art thou that dost torment me thus ?
O holy Friar , O , tell me , holy Friar , Where is my lady's lord ?
Get you to bed , faith .
O simple !
I am for you .
Will you go to them ?
O lamentable day !
A challenge , on my life .
What day is this ?
Which way ran he that killed Mercutio ?
Then move not , while my prayer's effect I take .
Thou , wretched boy , that didst consort him here Shalt with him hence .
My noble uncle , do you know the cause ?
So shall you feel the loss , but not the friend Which you weep for .
Alack the day .
Doth she not count her blessed , Unworthy as she is , that we have wrought So worthy a gentleman to be her bride ?
His son is elder , sir .
Her body sleeps in Capels ' monument , And her immortal part with angels lives .
Why the devil came you between us ?
Evermore weeping for your cousin's death ?
But where hast thou been , then ?
And if I can not , I'll find those that shall .
Is the day so young ?
O Tybalt , Tybalt , the best friend I had !
Calling death "banishment , " Thou cutt'st my head off with a golden ax And smilest upon the stroke that murders me .
A lantern , slaughtered youth , For here lies Juliet , and her beauty makes This vault a feasting presence full of light .
Why dost thou wring thy hands ?
I will frown as I pass by , and let them take it as they list .
Towards him I made , but he was 'ware of me And stole into the covert of the wood .
This , by his voice , should be a Montague. , What , dares the slave Come hither , covered with an antic face , To fleer and scorn at our solemnity ?
Answer to that .
I will give you the minstrel .
What sayst thou , my dear Nurse ?
Sleep dwell upon thine eyes , peace in thy breast .
Eyes , look your last .
She hath not seen the change of fourteen years .
Here's such a coil .
And is it not well served into a sweet goose ?
Alack the day !
Too swift arrives as tardy as too slow .
Hark ye , your Romeo will be here at night .
Methinks I see my cousin's ghost Seeking out Romeo , that did spit his body Upon a rapier's point .
Is 't good or bad ?
A plague o ' both your houses !
Good gentle youth , tempt not a desperate man .
Will you tell me that ?
Well , sir , my mistress is the sweetest lady. , Lord , Lord !
Nay , I am the very pink of courtesy .
As sweet repose and rest Come to thy heart as that within my breast .
What early tongue so sweet saluteth me ?
A cup , closed in my true love's hand ?
What is this ?
No better .
Gentle Mercutio , put thy rapier up .
Uncomfortable time , why camest thou now To murder , murder our solemnity ?
But , like a misbehaved and sullen wench , Thou pout'st upon thy fortune and thy love .
As I remember , this should be the house .
Mistress !
A thousand times the worse to want thy light .
Come , night .
Juliet ! , Fast , I warrant her , she. , Why , lamb !
Tybalt would kill thee , But thou slew'st Tybalt , there art thou happy .
There , where the torch doth burn .
By my head , here comes the Capulets .
Give me that mattock and the wrenching iron .
But I will write again to Mantua , And keep her at my cell till Romeo come .
Wherefore storm you so ?
The what ?
How is it with her ?
Romeo !
Ha ?
Verona's summer hath not such a flower .
Dost thou not bring me letters from the friar ?
Leave me and do the thing I bid thee do .
Wert thou as young as I , Juliet thy love , An hour but married , Tybalt murdered , Doting like me , and like me banished , Then mightst thou speak , then mightst thou tear thy hair And fall upon the ground , as I do now , Taking the measure of an unmade grave .
The excuse that thou dost make in this delay Is longer than the tale thou dost excuse .
These are news indeed !
I'll to my rest .
Oh , it is my love .
O me , O me !
Perhaps you have learned it without book .
Well , think of marriage now .
O noble prince , I can discover all The unlucky manage of this fatal brawl .
Fie , fie , thou shamest thy shape , thy love , thy wit , Which , like a usurer , abound'st in all And usest none in that true use indeed Which should bedeck thy shape , thy love , thy wit .
You know not what you do .
Three words , dear Romeo , and good night indeed .
And from her womb children of divers kind We sucking on her natural bosom find , Many for many virtues excellent , None but for some and yet all different .
It was the nightingale , and not the lark , That pierced the fearful hollow of thine ear .
Live , and hereafter say A madman's mercy bid thee run away .
Alas the day , it did .
May not one speak ?
The sweeter rest was mine .
The heads of the maids ?
My back a ' t ' other side .
O happy dagger , This is thy sheath .
Tis no less , I tell you , for the bawdy hand of the dial is now upon the prick of noon .
Stay but a little .
I have a soul of lead So stakes me to the ground I can not move .
Hence "banished" is banished from the world , And world's exile is death .
Benedicite .
Romeo is coming .
If I do so , it will be of more price Being spoke behind your back than to your face .
Well , what was yours ?
How well my comfort is revived by this !
Thou wast the prettiest babe that e'er I nursed .
Where's Romeo ?
Go with me to the vault .
Ay , the heads of the maids , or their maidenheads .
What says Romeo ?
What , rouse thee , man !
Perchance she can not meet him .
Tis well thou art not fish .
I'll find Romeo To comfort you .
Let me dispute with thee of thy estate .
What's this ?
Twas no need , I trow , To bid me trudge .
And yet I wish but for the thing I have .
Tybalt , the reason that I have to love thee Doth much excuse the appertaining rage To such a greeting .
Night's candles are burnt out , and jocund day Stands tiptoe on the misty mountain tops .
Where is my mother ?
When and where and how We met , we wooed and made exchange of vow , I'll tell thee as we pass , but this I pray : That thou consent to marry us today .
With another , for tying his new shoes with old ribbon ?
What of that ?
O , then , dear saint , let lips do what hands do .
Death , that hath ta'en her hence to make me wail , Ties up my tongue and will not let me speak .
They must take it in sense that feel it .
What's this ?
My soul , and not my child !
Seigneur Valentio and his cousin Tybalt ; Lucio and the lively Helena." A fair assembly .
Ay , boy , ready .
Hast thou slain Tybalt ?
And we mean well in going to this mask , But 'tis no wit to go .
Call her forth to me .
Hood my unmanned blood bating in my cheeks , With thy black mantle , till strange love , grow bold , Think true love acted simple modesty .
Shall I be married then tomorrow morning ?
Well , we were born to die .
Give me thy hand .
I neither know it nor can learn of him .
Ye say honestly .
You are looked for and called for , asked for and sought for , in the great chamber .
Acquaint her here of my son Paris ' love , And bid her , mark you me , on Wednesday next , But , soft !
She was too good for me .
Boy , this shall not excuse the injuries That thou hast done me .
Benvolio , who began this bloody fray ?
What's he that now is going out of door ?
Thou art like one of those fellows that , when he enters the confines of a tavern , claps me his sword upon the table and says "God send me no need of thee ! " and , by the operation of the second cup , draws it on the drawer when indeed there is no need .
Therefore be patient .
Here is a friar that trembles , sighs and weeps .
O lamentable day !
Tush , I will stir about , And all things shall be well , I warrant thee , wife .
They have made worms ' meat of me .
Wash they his wounds with tears ?
For , I am sure , you have your hands full all In this so sudden business .
And death , not Romeo , take my maidenhead !
Up .
I thought all for the best .
How doth my lady ?
I ' faith , I am sorry that thou art not well .
An if thou couldst , thou couldst not make him live .
You kiss by th ' book .
For I had then laid wormwood to my dug , Sitting in the sun under the dovehouse wall .
I strike quickly , being moved .
Not to his father's .
Whence come you ?
Now art thou Romeo .
Stay , fellow .
Be merciful , say "death , " For exile hath more terror in his look , Much more than death .
Nay , as they dare .
Run to the Capulets .
By my holy order , I thought thy disposition better tempered .
It is , it is .
Hold , take these keys , and fetch more spices , Nurse .
I'll make you quiet. , What , cheerly , my hearts !
Make it a word and a blow .
It is written , that the shoemaker should meddle with his yard and the tailor with his last , the fisher with his pencil and the painter with his nets .
What villain , madam ?
What , are you mad ?
That dreamers often lie .
Then will I lay the serving creature's dagger on your pate .
My words would bandy her to my sweet love , And his to me .
Appear thou in the likeness of a sigh !
I mean , an we be in choler , we'll draw .
Nay , gentle Romeo , we must have you dance .
Henceforward do your messages yourself .
Yea , noise ?
Being holiday , the beggar's shop is shut .
Is thy news good , or bad ?
Wherefore weep I then ?
If love be rough with you , be rough with love .
O God , I have an ill-divining soul .
Romeo must not live .
Out upon you !
Death lies on her like an untimely frost Upon the sweetest flower of all the field .
Love's heralds should be thoughts , Which ten times faster glide than the sun's beams , Driving back shadows over louring hills .
She's not well married that lives married long , But she's best married that dies married young .
Commend me to thy lady , And bid her hasten all the house to bed , Which heavy sorrow makes them apt unto .
Look thou but sweet , And I am proof against their enmity .
Tis more , 'tis more .
when 'twas a little prating thing. , Oh , there is a nobleman in town , one Paris , that would fain lay knife aboard , but she , good soul , had as lief see a toad , a very toad , as see him .
Ay , a thousand times. , Peter !
Pronounce this sentence then : Women may fall when there's no strength in men .
Lord , Lord , she will be a joyful woman .
Have I thought long to see this morning's face , And doth it give me such a sight as this ?
Your lady mother is coming to your chamber .
Tis since the earthquake now eleven years , And she was weaned , I never shall forget it , Of all the days of the year , upon that day .
Romeo .
You are a saucy boy .
How , how , how , how ?
A greater power than we can contradict Hath thwarted our intents .
Take it in what sense thou wilt .
The law that threatened death becomes thy friend And turns it to exile , there art thou happy .
Blind is his love and best befits the dark .
Give me leave awhile .
Is Romeo slaughtered , and is Tybalt dead ?
I hear some noise .
Th ' exchange of thy love's faithful vow for mine .
Need and oppression starveth in thine eyes .
Soft !
Oh , thou art deceived .
Hold , there is forty ducats .
Well , in that hit you miss .
Why , uncle , 'tis a shame .
Alack the day !
Holy Franciscan Friar !
Find them out whose names are written here ?
For naught so vile that on the earth doth live But to the earth some special good doth give .
Now do you know the reason of this haste .
I pray thee , chide not .
God ye good morrow , gentlemen .
What will you give us ?
What , still in tears , Evermore showering ?
Who is 't that calls ?
Farewell , dear Father .
What , dost thou make us minstrels ?
Lovers can see to do their amorous rites By their own beauties , or , if love be blind , It best agrees with night .
Now , fellow , What is there ?
See where she comes from shrift with merry look .
Most miserable hour that e'er time saw In lasting labor of his pilgrimage .
Down with the Capulets !
Go , you cot-quean , go .
I do remember well where I should be , And there I am .
I will bring you thither .
We shall be much unfurnished for this time .
Thou hast amazed me .
Clubs , bills , and partisans !
And sayst thou yet that exile is not death ?
We can not be here and there too .
No , sir .
Delay this marriage for a month , a week .
Conceit , more rich in matter than in words , Brags of his substance , not of ornament .
Whither should they come ?
His son is thirty .
Not mad , but bound more than a madman is , Shut up in prison , kept without my food , Whipped and tormented and , Good e'en , good fellow .
Hast thou met with him ?
Oh , what learning is !
Quarrel , sir ?
My husband is on earth , my faith in heaven .
Confusion's cure lives not In these confusions .
Some twenty of them fought in this black strife , And all those twenty could but kill one life .
Meantime forbear , And let mischance be slave to patience. , Bring forth the parties of suspicion .
I stand on sudden haste .
They stumble that run fast .
Young Romeo is it ?
Me they shall feel while I am able to stand , and 'tis known I am a pretty piece of flesh .
Scurvy knave !
Where should she be ?
My fan , Peter .
Sojourn in Mantua .
Thus then in brief : The valiant Paris seeks you for his love .
For Juliet's sake , for her sake , rise and stand .
Can I go forward when my heart is here ?
She hath , and in that sparing makes huge waste , For beauty , starved with her severity , Cuts beauty off from all posterity .
And badest me bury love .
So that my speed to Mantua there was stayed .
Thy head is as full of quarrels as an egg is full of meat , and yet thy head hath been beaten as addle as an egg for quarreling .
Do as I bid thee , go .
The orchard walls are high and hard to climb , And the place death , considering who thou art , If any of my kinsmen find thee here .
Said he not so ?
I would not for the world they saw thee here .
Oh , look !
Speak not .
Then plainly know my heart's dear love is set On the fair daughter of rich Capulet .
Arise .
Let him alone .
Hath Romeo slain himself ?
Life , living , all is Death's .
I will not fail .
Draw thy tool !
I beseech thee , youth , Put not another sin upon my head By urging me to fury .
Why , what is Tybalt ?
What noise is this ?
This same should be the voice of Friar John .
I wonder at this haste , that I must wed Ere he , that should be husband , comes to woo .
Shall I believe That unsubstantial death is amorous , And that the lean abhorred monster keeps Thee here in dark to be his paramour ?
Thou hast quarreled with a man for coughing in the street because he hath wakened thy dog that hath lain asleep in the sun .
Marry , come up , I trow .
Tell me , that I may sack The hateful mansion .
I am the greatest , able to do least , Yet most suspected , as the time and place Doth make against me , of this direful murder .
The world affords no law to make thee rich .
Is this the poultice for my aching bones ?
Had she affections and warm youthful blood , She would be as swift in motion as a ball .
It is the east , and Juliet is the sun .
I'll have this knot knit up tomorrow morning .
Let us take the law of our sides .
Thy drugs are quick .
Good night , good night !
Commend me to your daughter .
Trust to 't , bethink you .
We have a trifling foolish banquet towards. , Is it e'en so ?
Tomorrow will I send .
An eagle , madam , Hath not so green , so quick , so fair an eye As Paris hath .
For , hark you , Tybalt being slain so late , It may be thought we held him carelessly , Being our kinsman , if we revel much .
Oh , here Will I set up my everlasting rest , And shake the yoke of inauspicious stars From this world-wearied flesh .
She's cold .
Therefore thy earliness doth me assure Thou art uproused by some distemperature .
Virtue itself turns vice , being misapplied , And vice sometime by action dignified .
Where is she ?
Search , seek , and know how this foul murder comes .
I'll not be forsworn .
What , have you dined at home ?
Gentlemen , can any of you tell me where I may find the young Romeo ?
A dog of that house shall move me to stand .
Pitiful sight !
Or , if you do not , make the bridal bed In that dim monument where Tybalt lies .
Why , that same pale hard-hearted wench , that Rosaline , Torments him so , that he will sure run mad .
Romeo !
And , as he fell , did Romeo turn and fly .
Out , alas !
Do you bite your thumb at us , sir ?
I can tell you , but young Romeo will be older when you have found him than he was when you sought him .
Tis late .
Haply some poison yet doth hang on them , To make me die with a restorative .
Oh , she doth teach the torches to burn bright !
The fee simple ?
Whither ?
Saint Francis be my speed !
How oddly thou repliest !
Come , is the bride ready to go to church ?
I saw no man use you at his pleasure .
Any man that can write may answer a letter .
I think He told me Paris should have married Juliet .
Why , such is love's transgression .
Fear me not .
Therefore stay yet .
Tis almost morning .
What misadventure is so early up That calls our person from our morning rest ?
And too soon marred are those so early made .
God's bread !
As much to him , else is his thanks too much .
Now , afore God , I am so vexed that every part about me quivers .
