Or say , sweet love , what thou desirest to eat .
If any , speak , for him have I offended .
But it was , as I received it , and others , whose judgments in such matters cried in the top of mine , an excellent play , well digested in the scenes , set down with as much modesty as cunning .
I saw her laid low in her kindred's vault And presently took post to tell it you .
M" , Malvolio .

There is a cliff , whose high and bending head Looks fearfully in the confined deep .
Make it no wonder .
Know'st thou this country ?
That is the very defect of the matter , sir .
What's here ?
Yea , dost thou jeer and flout me in the teeth ?
Romeo , will you come to your father's ?
He's a conspirator .
Look whe'e he has not turned his color and has tears in 's eyes. , Prithee , no more .
The gods do this in shame of cowardice .
The thought whereof Doth , like a poisonous mineral , gnaw my inwards , And nothing can or shall content my soul Till I am evened with him , wife for wife .
How came we ashore ?
Take my sword .
Spare not for the cost .
I am locked in one of them .
Know thus far forth : By accident most strange , bountiful Fortune ( Now my dear lady ) hath mine enemies Brought to this shore .
I am glad of it .
For I can give his humor the true bent , And I will bring him to the Capitol .
Why , what is Tybalt ?
Moreover , he hath left you all his walks , His private arbors and new-planted orchards , On this side Tiber .
Off with his son George's head !
Master young gentleman , I pray you , which is the way to Master Jew's ?
Ay , two hours together .
By this scimitar That slew the Sophy and a Persian prince That won three fields of Sultan Solyman , I would o'erstare the sternest eyes that look , Outbrave the heart most daring on the earth , Pluck the young sucking cubs from the she-bear , Yea , mock the lion when he roars for prey , To win the lady .
Sir , the gods Will have it thus .
Have you heard any imputation to the contrary ?
A noble ship of Venice Hath seen a grievous wreck and sufferance On most part of their fleet .
The best news is that we have safely found Our king and company .
But what though ?
Then leave her , sir , for by the power that made me , I tell you all her wealth .
Well , go thy way .
So much was his pleasure should be proclaimed .
Let her awhile be secretly kept in And publish it that she is dead indeed .
You look not well , Signor Antonio .
But where hast thou been , then ?
In wisdom I should ask thy name .
Open 't , and read it .
Then have at you with my wit .
But yet I feel I fear .
As I !
Alack the day !
What's the matter , dear ?
Do we but find the tyrant's power tonight , Let us be beaten if we can not fight .
Be warned by me , then : they that ride so , and ride not warily , fall into foul bogs .
The king's a-bed .
Oh , thou didst then ne'er love so heartily .
O my Christian ducats !
But sure I fear we shall not win him to it .
Hath he provided this music ?
How old art thou ?
I am Christophero Sly .
Inform her full of my particular fear , And thereto add such reasons of your own As may compact it more .
With all my heart , and it doth much content me To hear him so inclined .
Let them come before Master Constable .
Never come such division 'tween our souls .
What thou wouldst highly , That wouldst thou holily ; wouldst not play false , And yet wouldst wrongly win .
Here .
Cassius , what night is this !
Ay , but these English are shrewdly out of beef .
Am I come near ye now ? , Welcome , gentlemen !
I go , my lord .
Amen .
Not that , I hope , which you received of me .
I think so too .
What have you done , my lord , with the dead body ?
Pray now , rest yourself .
And here he stands .
Relent ?
No words can that woe sound .
Your daughter spent in Genoa , as I heard , in one night fourscore ducats .
We are blessed in the change .
And I do with an eye of love requite her .
Till then , enough .
Sound , trumpet !
I do beseech you To understand my purposes aright .
Then do but say to me what I should do That in your knowledge may by me be done , And I am pressed unto it .
Nothing but "low" and "little" ! , Why will you suffer her to flout me thus ?
If thou delight to view thy heinous deeds , Behold this pattern of thy butcheries .
Most learned judge , a sentence !
They must take it in sense that feel it .
Come away .
That same cowardly , giantlike ox-beef hath devoured many a gentleman of your house .
I am one , my liege , Whom the vile blows and buffets of the world Have so incensed that I am reckless what I do to spite the world .
The man is notwithstanding sufficient .
Therefore let Benedick , like covered fire , Consume away in sighs , waste inwardly .
Your loss is as yourself , great , and you bear it As answering to the weight .
Think you not that the powers we bear with us Will cut their passage through the force of France , Doing the execution and the act For which we have in head assembled them ?
Madam , bethink you , like a careful mother , Of the young prince your son .
Speak this no more .
Doth his Majesty Incline to it or no ?
Gentle madam , no .
Awake remembrance of these valiant dead And with your puissant arm renew their feats .
Young Fortinbras , with conquest come from Poland , To th ' ambassadors of England gives This warlike volley .
I thank thee for thy care and honest pains .
Love ?
Come , come , let us thither .
Soldier , you must come to the king .
See , see , here comes the man we went to seek .
In your dumps ?
Who stocked my servant ?
God bless me from a challenge !
That they lack , for if their heads had any intellectual armor , they could never wear such heavy head-pieces .
Thou'rt a scholar .
How is 't with you ?
Farewell .
Bear it straight , And bring thy master home immediately .
Expose thyself to feel what wretches feel , That thou mayst shake the superflux to them And show the heavens more just .
Faith , none but Humfrey Hower , that called your Grace To breakfast once , forth of my company .
Oh , my soul's joy !
His bark is stoutly timbered and his pilot Of very expert and approved allowance Therefore my hopes , not surfeited to death , Stand in bold cure .
Epicurism and lust Make it more like a tavern or a brothel Than a graced palace .
No , though thou call'st thyself a hotter name Than any is in hell .
But come , your Bergomask .
I beg for justice , which thou , Prince , must give .
He hath every month a new sworn brother .
I'll grow a talker for this gear .
Oh , she is lame !
He had a thousand noses , Horns whelked and waved like the enraged sea .
How many cowards whose hearts are all as false As stairs of sand wear yet upon their chins The beards of Hercules and frowning Mars , Who , inward searched , have livers white as milk , And these assume but valor's excrement To render them redoubted .
To bed , to bed .
Strumpet , I come .
This , this All Souls ' Day to my fearful soul Is the determined respite of my wrongs .
What's the matter ?
I will go lose myself And wander up and down to view the city .
Nothing , unless you render her again .
O , 'tis a parlous boy , Bold , quick , ingenious , forward , capable .
But I confess , sir , that we were locked out .
And when I do , I swear It shall be Romeo , whom you know I hate , Rather than Paris .
Swoons rather , for so bad a prayer as his Was never yet for sleep .
Well , sir , good night .
Double , double toil and trouble , Fire burn , and cauldron bubble .
My cousin's a fool , and thou art another .
Go , bind this man , for he is frantic too .
And thou unfit for any place but hell .
Sir boy , I'll whip you from your foining fence , Nay , as I am a gentleman , I will .
Let us bear him To th' court of guard .
We shall chide downright , if I longer stay .
With cunning hast thou filched my daughter's heart , Turned her obedience ( which is due to me ) To stubborn harshness. , And , my gracious duke , Be it so she will not here before your grace Consent to marry with Demetrius , I beg the ancient privilege of Athens .
And if thy poor devoted servant may But beg one favor at thy gracious hand , Thou dost confirm his happiness forever .
In nothing am I changed But in my garments .
There , My music playing far off , I will betray Tawny-finned fishes .
I will not hold thee long .
I never got him. , Hark , the duke's trumpets .
No ?
I know our country disposition well .
He is then a giant to an ape ; but then is an ape a doctor to such a man .
Nothing , Messala .
No , 'tis hereafter to know , but now to promise .
I would I could see this taborer .
Alive in triumph , and Mercutio slain !
You peasant swain !
A love song , a love song .
Hast thou forgot thyself ?
And wherefore doth Lysander Deny your love , so rich within his soul , And tender me , forsooth , affection , But by your setting on , by your consent ?
I will die , And leave him all .
Look , look , a mouse !
Ha , ha !
My Lord of Gloucester , I have too long borne Your blunt upbraidings and your bitter scoffs .
I will not long be troubled with you .
No blown ambition doth our arms incite , But love , dear love ! , and our aged father's right .
Here cease more questions .
Tell me , daughter Juliet , How stands your disposition to be married ?
Give us the place alone .
Nay , if an oily palm be not a fruitful prognostication , I can not scratch mine ear. , Prithee , tell her but a workaday fortune .
My worthy Cawdor !
Therefore speak .
Lend thine ear .
I arrest thee of high treason , by the name of Henry , Lord Scroop of Masham .
The concavities of it is not sufficient , for , look you , th ' athversary , you may discuss unto the duke , look you , is digt himself four yard under the countermines .
A southwest blow on ye And blister you all o'er !
Then have at thee , boy !
I thank you .
Bring him silently .
We shall be much unfurnished for this time .
That's as much as to say , the sweet youth's in love .
Hail to your grace .
They have in England A coin that bears the figure of an angel Stamped in gold , but that's insculped upon .
She died , my lord , but whiles her slander lived .
Give him the cup .
This disturbed sky Is not to walk in .
If thou beest not immortal , look about you .
I'll not endure it .
Who are the late commissioners ?
Those linen cheeks of thine Are counselors to fear .
Farewell , kind lord .
She that herself will sliver and disbranch From her material sap perforce must wither And come to deadly use .

Though others have the arm , show us the sleeve ; We in your motion turn , and you may move us .
Bonos dies , Sir Toby .
But I will punish home .
But Oh , how bitter a thing it is to look into happiness through another man's eyes .
Ring the alarum bell .
Come , come away .
I will go along .
He's gone .
Go , vanish into air , away !
Let your highness Command upon me , to the which my duties Are with a most indissoluble tie Forever knit .

Neighbors , God speed .
Friends to this ground .
Listen but speak not to 't .
But yet hie you to Egypt again .

Yet , if you be out , sir , I can mend you .

Give thy thoughts no tongue , Nor any unproportioned thought his act .
A sweet woman !
Thou chid'st me oft for loving Rosaline .
I am hurt .

Do not say so , my lord .

One is too poor , too weak for my revenge .
Dolabella , I shall remain your debtor .
Antony , Leave thy lascivious wassails .
Tis not to make me jealous To say my wife is fair , feeds well , loves company , Is free of speech , sings , plays , and dances .
Fear'st thou that , Antonio ?
I have .
Wherefore are these things hid ?
I shall .
Be not you ashamed to show , he'll not shame to tell you what it means .
What is it thou didst say ?

At this same ancient feast of Capulet's Sups the fair Rosaline whom thou so loves With all the admired beauties of Verona .
Good night , Lord Brutus .
What thou wouldst do Is done unto thy hand .
Yet if thou say Antony lives , is well , Or friends with Caesar , or not captive to him , I'll set thee in a shower of gold and hail Rich pearls upon thee .

The gods defend her ! , hear him hence awhile .
I will do 't , my lord .
Wake her not .
Oh , what a goodly outside falsehood hath !
All will be well .
The several messengers From hence attend dispatch .
Now am I dead .
I warrant thou art a merry fellow and carest for nothing .
With him ?

Give me up the truth .

A commodity in question , I warrant you. , Come , we'll obey you .

Let's think 't unsafe To come in to the cry without more help .

Villain , not for thy life !
O , he is mad , Laertes .
It's suppertime , my lord .

How easy is it , then !
She well instructs me .
I might do 't as well i ' th ' dark .
I pray you mar no more of my verses with reading them ill- favoredly .

Say you ?
As it determines , so Dissolve my life !
A match !
They were traitors !
The thoughts of people .
You told me you salute not at the court but you kiss your hands .
My lady is within , sir .
At every house I'll call .

Therefore let every man now task his thought , That this fair action may on foot be brought .
At thy request , monster , I will do reason , any reason. , Come on , Trinculo , let us sing .
God and the rope-maker bear me witness That I was sent for nothing but a rope .
Can you do it ?
Go with me , And in the breath of bitter words let's smother My damned son that thy two sweet sons smothered .

Fortune and Antony part here .
When last I was at Exeter , The mayor in courtesy showed me the castle And called it Rougemont , at which name I started , Because a bard of Ireland told me once I should not live long after I saw Richmond .
Their preparation is today by sea .
Why , there then !

He breathes , my lord .
Nay , that's certain .

Have you no wit , manners , nor honesty but to gabble like tinkers at this time of night ?
Good fool , help me to some light and some paper .
But thus , I trust , you will not marry her .
It were , my lord , a hard condition for a maid to consign to .
My villainy they have upon record , which I had rather seal with my death than repeat over to my shame .
Trinculo , run into no further danger .
Know we this face or no ?
Nay , we will slink away in supper time , Disguise us at my lodging , and return , All in an hour .
As I descended ?
Look , here it is .

Her waspish-headed son has broke his arrows , Swears he will shoot no more , but play with sparrows And be a boy right out .

You have an excellent armor , but let my horse have his due .
Now heaven help him !
Farewell , sweet playfellow .
Th ' occasion speaks thee , and My strong imagination sees a crown Dropping upon thy head .

What would you have ?
If trembling I inhabit then , protest me The baby of a girl .
Tell me thine first .
Come , bring us , bring us where he is .
Why , how now , cousin !
I think thou art in mind , and so am I. Nay , master , both in mind and in my shape .
Would thou'dst be ruled by me !
Can virtue hide itself ?
Indeed ?
How are they escoted ?
I did send , After the last enchantment you did here , A ring in chase of you .
And , to inure thyself to what thou art like to be , cast thy humble slough and appear fresh .
Though now this grained face of mine be hid In sap-consuming winter's drizzled snow , And all the conduits of my blood froze up , Yet hath my night of life some memory , My wasting lamps some fading glimmer left , My dull deaf ears a little use to hear .
Count Claudio ?
For but a month ago I went from hence , And then 'twas fresh in murmur , as , you know , What great ones do the less will prattle of , That he did seek the love of fair Olivia .

Yea , the same .
He's almost slain , and Roderigo dead .
Let me not burst in ignorance , but tell Why thy canonized bones , hearsed in death , Have burst their cerements ; why the sepulcher ,
But will you woo this wildcat ?
I had rather be a canker in a hedge than a rose in his grace , and it better fits my blood to be disdained of all than to fashion a carriage to rob love from any .
Welcome hither .
Here's neither bush nor shrub to bear off any weather at all .
If he were dead , what would betide on me ?
Do we trouble you ?
A pestilent gall to me !
Here's a night pities neither wise man nor fool .

A noble prisoner !
Tush , I may as well say the fool's the fool .
They did so , to th ' amazement of mine eyes That looked upon 't .
What is between you ?
Stay not , be gone .
Will you speak well of him that killed your cousin ?
Were you made the messenger ?
You , you , ay , you !
Counterfeit , I assure you .

Give me thy hand .
Thursday is near .
As freely , son , as God did give her me .
Shall we part , sweet girl ?
Sweet Portia , If you did know to whom I gave the ring , If you did know for whom I gave the ring , And would conceive for what I gave the ring , And how unwillingly I left the ring When naught would be accepted but the ring , You would abate the strength of your displeasure .

I can not make you what amends I would ; Therefore accept such kindness as I can .
Good faith , good faith , the saying did not hold In him that did object the same to thee !
She was too good for me .
But who is with him ?
The Duke himself , Or any of my brothers of the state , Can not but feel this wrong as 'twere their own .
Let them go .
It is too heavy for your Grace to wear .
Not a whit .
If she should make tender of her love , 'tis very possible he'll scorn it , for the man , as you know all , hath a contemptible spirit .
Be of good cheer , youth .

Pour on , I will endure .
What , sigh for the toothache ?
Do so .

O you mighty gods , This world I do renounce , and in your sights Shake patiently my great affliction off .
If you do meet Horatio and Marcellus , The rivals of my watch , bid them make haste .
Not in a grave , To lay one in , another out to have .
You the like loss ?

Not in my house , Lucentio , for you know Pitchers have ears , and I have many servants .
These fellows have some soul ,
Not here in presence .
The duke's to blame in this .
And , you know , his means , If he improve them , may well stretch so far As to annoy us all ; which to prevent , Let Antony and Caesar fall together .
Caesar is turned to hear .

My resolution's placed , and I have nothing Of woman in me .
As the cony that you see dwell where she is kindled .

Comfort me .
And whatsoever else shall hap tonight , Give it an understanding , but no tongue .
But in respect of that , I would fain think it were not .
Find thou the means , and I'll find such a man .
Of princes in this number And nobles bearing banners , there lie dead One hundred twenty-six .
We are two lions littered in one day , And I the elder and more terrible .

When I was with him I have heard him swear To Tubal and to Chus , his countrymen , That he would rather have Antonio's flesh Than twenty times the value of the sum That he did owe him .
Well too .
Till that , I'll view the manners of the town , Peruse the traders , gaze upon the buildings , And then return and sleep within mine inn , For with long travel I am stiff and weary .
What is your will ?
Ah me !
Hail , most dear Caesar !
It stops me here , it is too much of joy .
Is 't possible ?

Welcome , my friends all .
Draw up your powers .
Madam , I trust , not so .
Is she shrill-tongued or low ?

Time hath not yet so dried this blood of mine Nor age so eat up my invention Nor fortune made such havoc of my means Nor my bad life reft me so much of friends But they shall find , awaked in such a kind , Both strength of limb and policy of mind , Ability in means and choice of friends , To quit me of them throughly .

But all the story of the night told over , And all their minds transfigured so together , More witnesseth than fancy's images And grows to something of great constancy , But , howsoever , strange and admirable .
A horse , a horse , my kingdom for a horse !
Of a strange nature is the suit you follow , Yet in such rule that the Venetian law Can not impugn you as you do proceed. , Ay , so he says .
Therefore I pray you lead me to the caskets To try my fortune .
Madam , I come to whet your gentle thoughts On his behalf .
Where is thy husband now ?
Madman , thou errest .
Believe me , I can not .
Oh , this is it that makes your servants droop !
Tomorrow , as he purposes .
Well , madam , and in health .
Tis most true , And he beseeched me to entreat your Majesties To hear and see the matter .
Liar and slave !
The limit of your lives is out .
No , my noble lord .
Methinks his words do from such passion fly , That he believes himself .
If I last in this service , you must case me in leather .
Would you , the supervisor , grossly gape on , Behold her topped ?
When ?
To cry "Amen" to that , thus we appear .
And having brought our treasure where we will , Then take we down his load and turn him off , Like to the empty ass , to shake his ears And graze in commons .
He is as disproportioned in his manners As in his shape. , Take with you your companions .
Nor must not then be yielded to in this .
Come .
I durst not !
No cock of mine .
Cursed be thy stones for thus deceiving me !
A jealous hood , a jealous hood !
Fie , what a slug is Hastings that he comes not To tell us whether they will come or no !
I'll fume with them ! " And with that word she struck me on the head , And through the instrument my pate made way ,
Do you misdoubt This sword and these my wounds ?
O fortune , fortune !
She hath not seen the change of fourteen years .
Blistered be thy tongue For such a wish !
I understand a fury in your words , But not the words .
Rapier and dagger .
O sweet mistress , speak !
Bids the winds blow the earth into the sea Or swell the curled water 'bove the main , That things might change or cease .
Brother Anthony ,
A man no mightier than thyself or me In personal action , yet prodigious grown , And fearful as these strange eruptions are .
Do you not hear me speak ?
Cousins , I hope the days are near at hand That chambers will be safe .
No going then !
Come , warble , come .
Shut up your doors .
I serve as good a man as you .
He had a kind of taste. , Well , my conscience says , "Launcelot , budge not." "Budge ! " says the fiend .
I overheard him and his practices .
Nay , more , if any born at Ephesus Be seen at any Syracusian marts and fairs ; Again , if any Syracusian born Come to the bay of Ephesus , he dies , His goods confiscate to the Duke's dispose , Unless a thousand marks be levied To quit the penalty and to ransom him .
Th' art an honest man .
My lord ?
I would have all well betwixt you .
Why should he call her "whore" ?
I forgive you the praise .
I should be angry with you if the time were convenient .
To these injunctions every one doth swear That comes to hazard for my worthless self .
Sir , I must have that diamond from you .
O'er my spirit Thy full supremacy thou knew'st , and that Thy beck might from the bidding of the gods Command me .
Hold , take thou that and that .
Carried to Colmekill , The sacred storehouse of his predecessors , And guardian of their bones .
To see no pastime I .
Wake Duncan with thy knocking .
But as I think , for truly would I speak , And now do I bethink me , so it is , I came with Hermia hither .
I thank thee , good Sir John , with all my heart .
Tis as arrant a piece of knavery , mark you now , as can be offert , in your conscience now , is it not ?
I know where I will wear this dagger then .
O true , good Catesby .
Thus it remains , and the remainder thus .
My charge was but to fetch you from the mart Home to your house , the Phoenix , sir , to dinner .
Do , young sir .
Speak , man .
Welcome .
Where the devil should he learn our language ?
Make thy two eyes , like stars , start from their spheres , Thy knotted and combined locks to part And each particular hair to stand on end , Like quills upon the fearful porpentine .
Didst thou not say he comes ?
What unaccustomed cause procures her hither ?
O Cassio , whence came this ?
What says the golden chest ?
My brother and thy uncle , called Antonio , I pray thee , mark me ( that a brother should Be so perfidious !
He says his name is Master Fer .
Niece , will you look to those things I told you of ?
Tell the hot duke that Lear , No , but not yet .
Yes , marry , sir .
Show me , my women , like a queen .
Didst not mark that ?
Marry , sir , to get a husband for her sister .
Good signors both , when shall we laugh ?
Why of thy thought , Iago ?
Malcolm and Donalbain , the king's two sons , Are stol'n away and fled , which puts upon them Suspicion of the deed .
That now Sweno , the Norways ' king , craves composition .
O , let her live , And I'll corrupt her manners , stain her beauty , Slander myself as false to Edward's bed , Throw over her the veil of infamy .
Ay , but he will not now be pacified .
Out o ' your wits and hearing too ?
Shall we their fond pageant see ?
I prithee , pretty youth , let me be better acquainted with thee .
You , uncivil lady , To whose ingrate and unauspicious altars My soul the faithfull'st off'rings have breathed out That e'er devotion tendered , what shall I do ?
You know the law .
Oh , ay .
Why should the poor be flattered ?
You shall try but one fall .
Tis no time to play now .
I'll know his humor when he knows his time .
Shall we not ?
It is a nipping and an eager air .
I will to Egypt .
Now , by Saint George , I am too young for you .
Do not torment me .
Let me lick thy shoe .
Faith , the priest was good enough , for all the old gentleman's saying .
There was never counterfeit of passion came so near the life of passion as she discovers it .
I will plague them all , Even to roaring .
Then are our beggars bodies , and our monarchs and outstretched heroes the beggars ' shadows .
I will not leave him now till Cassio Be called to him. , How is 't with you , my lord ?
Oh , the difference of man and man !
And did not they Put on my brows this wreath of victory And bid me give it thee ?
Well mayst thou woo , and happy be thy speed .
Here comes the fool , i ' faith .
He shall do this , or else I do recant The pardon that I late pronounced here .
It is the rival of my love .
Even now a tailor called me in his shop And showed me silks that he had bought for me , And therewithal took measure of my body .
There is a lord will hear you play tonight ; But I am doubtful of your modesties , Lest over-eyeing of his odd behavior , For yet his Honor never heard a play , You break into some merry passion And so offend him .
Good day to both of you .
Upon the stroke of ten .
The moon methinks looks with a watery eye .
A strange fish !
What wouldst thou write of me , if thou should'st praise me ?
Besides , they all are fresh .
O God , did Romeo's hand shed Tybalt's blood ?
He was a goodly king .
Great happiness !
This wretch hath part confessed his villainy .
Men shall deal unadvisedly sometimes , Which after-hours give leisure to repent .
Commend me to my kind lord .
The lieutenant tonight watches on the court of guard .
And thence from Athens turn away our eyes To seek new friends and stranger companies .
The mighty dukes , Gloucester and Buckingham .
I told you , sir , they were red-hot with drinking , So full of valor that they smote the air For breathing in their faces , beat the ground For kissing of their feet , yet always bending Towards their project .
I should ev'n die with pity To see another thus .
Be your tears wet ?
I am sorry thou wilt leave my father so .
I thank thee for that jest .
Sirrah , I'll teach thee a speech .
To fright you thus methinks I am too savage ; To do worse to you were fell cruelty , Which is too nigh your person .
Ah ha !
What news more ?
We must both give and take , my loving lord .
I think nobly of the soul , and no way approve his opinion .
Thou didst smile Infused with a fortitude from heaven , When I have decked the sea with drops full salt , Under my burthen groaned ; which raised in me An undergoing stomach to bear up Against what should ensue .
Will money buy 'em ?
When I like your favor , for God defend the lute should be like the case !
Let it be so .
Caesar , thou canst not die by traitors ' hands Unless thou bring'st them with thee .
Would he not be a comfort to our travel ?
I am desperate of my fortunes if they check me .
Nay , gentle Romeo , we must have you dance .
Then make a ring about the corpse of Caesar , And let me show you him that made the will .
So is my horse , Octavius , and for that I do appoint him store of provender .
Security gives way to conspiracy .
Dear love , adieu. , Anon , good Nurse ! , Sweet Montague , be true .
Whereon I do beseech thee , grant me this , To leave me but a little to myself .
Who are they ?
Let our officers Have notice what we purpose .
Stay , countrymen .
He is a craven and a villain else , an 't please your Majesty , in my conscience .
Why , look you how you storm !
Lord , let me never have a cause to sigh , Till I be brought to such a silly pass !
And now methinks I have a mind to it .
Look thou but sweet , And I am proof against their enmity .
Speak .
I would have blowed up the town , so Chrish save me , la , in an hour .
Sweet remembrancer !
By God's sonties , 'twill be a hard way to hit .
Why had I one ?
But here my father comes .
What sum owes he the Jew ?
Hence will I to my ghostly friar's close cell , His help to crave and my dear hap to tell .
Help me , help me !
Hold off thy hand .
Presently ?
I fear 'tis choleric .
Feed and sleep .
One , sir , that for his love dares yet do more Than you have heard him brag to you he will .
It will be short .
Well , say , sir .
Give welcome to my friend .
My lord , I do not know that I did cry .
How beauteous mankind is !
Sink Rome !
Go off , I discard you .
If we do meet again , why , we shall smile .
We'll so begin these rites As we do trust they'll end , in true delights .
Do you sing it , and I'll dance it .
I am only sorry He had no other death's-man .
O , my lord , You said that idle weeds are fast in growth .
Wherefore to Dover , sir ?
Nay , yet there's more in this .
That nothing do but meditate on blood , To swearing and stern looks , diffused attire , And everything that seems unnatural .
If I have killed the issue of your womb , To quicken your increase I will beget Mine issue of your blood upon your daughter .
Exceedingly , my lord .
For your coming in to dinner , sir , why , let it be as humours and conceits shall govern .
Therefore , as I am bound , Receive it from me .
How chances it they travel ?
This purse of ducats I received from you , And Dromio my man did bring them me .
Friar !
And in good time here the lieutenant comes. , Master Lieutenant , pray you , by your leave , How doth the prince and my young son of York ?
Where is my gracious lord of Canterbury ?
Your tale , sir , would cure deafness .
If you knew my business , You would entreat me rather go than stay .
These Moors are changeable in their wills , fill thy purse with money .
When I have plucked thy rose I can not give it vital growth again , It must needs wither .
Dorset is fled to Richmond .
My noble girls !
They are loves I bear to you .
If I do not put on a sober habit , Talk with respect and swear but now and then , Wear prayer books in my pocket , look demurely , Nay more .
That high All-seer which I dallied with Hath turned my feigned prayer on my head And given in earnest what I begged in jest .
None .
For three months , well .
His beard was grizzled , no ?
Thriftless ambition , that will raven up Thine own lives ' means !
And sometime comes she with a tithe-pig's tail Tickling a parson's nose as he lies asleep , Then he dreams of another benefice .
My lord , the first time that I ever saw him Methought he was a brother to your daughter .
You shall not gauge me By what we do tonight .
What have I kept back ?
But I'll go in .
Ay , marry , why was he sent into England ?
What man is that ?
I will not stay behind .
I know into what straits of fortune she is driven , and it is not impossible to me , if it appear not inconvenient to you , to set her before your eyes tomorrow , human as she is , and without any danger .
Fair lovers , you are fortunately met .
Thou dost , and think'st it much to tread the ooze Of the salt deep , To run upon the sharp wind of the north , To do me business in the veins o ' th ' earth When it is baked with frost .
To which we all appeal .
No .
We shall find of him A shrewd contriver .
And make him with fair aegles break his faith , With Ariadne and Antiopa ?
I will preach to thee .
Amen .
And time is at his period .
That is another simple sin in you , to bring the ewes and the rams together and to offer to get your living by the copulation of cattle ; to be bawd to a bellwether and to betray a she-lamb of a twelvemonth to a crooked-pated old cuckoldly ram , out of all reasonable match .
Welcome , then , Thou unsubstantial air that I embrace !
An I had been a man of any occupation , if I would not have taken him at a word , I would I might go to hell among the rogues .
Good countrymen , let me depart alone .
With one fool's head I came to woo , But I go away with two. , Sweet , adieu .
Twice then the trumpets sounded , And there I left him tranced .
My sword , I say !
Come forth , I say !
I dare say you love him not so ill to wish him here alone , howsoever you speak this to feel other men's minds .
Will you go , sister ? , Shepherd , ply her hard .
No , coz , I rather weep .
I will the banner from a trumpet take And use it for my haste .
And so they are .
Not having that which , having , makes them short .
I , for my part , knew the tailor that made the wings she flew withal .
Nor for yours neither .
Go to , woman , Throw your vile guesses in the devil's teeth From whence you have them .
Come , you and I will thither presently .
Marry , as for Clarence , he is well repaid ; He is franked up to fatting for his pains .
Come , my fair Cordelia .
Good Portia , go to bed .
I hope he is much grown since last I saw him .
What , girl , though gray Do something mingle with our younger brown , yet ha' we A brain that nourishes our nerves and can Get goal for goal of youth .
Here comes other reck'nings .
If you meet the Prince in the night , you may stay him .
If we , with thrice such powers left at home , Can not defend our own doors from the dog , Let us be worried , and our nation lose The name of hardiness and policy .
I pray you , go Along with me .
Sweet Sir Andrew !
Nor go neither .
If fortune be not ours today , it is Because we brave her .
If the enemy is an ass and a fool and a prating coxcomb , is it meet , think you , that we should also , look you , be an ass and a fool and a prating coxcomb , in your own conscience , now ?
A friendly eye could never see such faults .
Sir , I commend you to your own content .
Lie not a night from home .
But I'll amerce you with so strong a fine That you shall all repent the loss of mine .
Therefore confess thee freely of thy sin , For to deny each article with oath Can not remove nor choke the strong conception That I do groan withal .
Skipper , stand back .
All that glisters is not gold , Often have you heard that told .
I have , since I was three year old , conversed with a magician , most profound in his art and yet not damnable .
With Demetrius .
No doubt but he hath got a quiet catch .
I know thee well .
A man that had a wife with such a wit , he might say "Wit , whither wilt ? " Nay , you might keep that check for it , till you met your wife's wit going to your neighbor's bed .
Oh , heaven forgive us !
Why , you speak like an ancient and most quiet watchman , for I can not see how sleeping should offend .
I hate it as an unfilled can .
You do me wrong to take me out o ' th ' grave .
He may win , And what is music then ?
And thus a while the fit will work on him .
Therefore with frank and with uncurbed plainness Tell us the Dauphin's mind .
Will you pluck your sword out of his pilcher by the ears ?
You'll have coursers for cousins and gennets for germans .
Do you not hear it ring ?
Go get some water , And wash this filthy witness from your hand .
I hate the word , As I hate hell , all Montagues , and thee .
Give him heedful note .
And so swear I .
Let us be sacrificers but not butchers , Caius .
Pray thee , sweet Mistress Margaret , deserve well at my hands by helping me to the speech of Beatrice .
I will bestow you where you shall have time To speak your bosom freely .
He will come straight .
Thou hadst need send for more money .
I dare draw as soon as another man if I see occasion in a good quarrel and the law on my side .
Fie , fie , 'tis lewd and filthy !
Friends , begone .
Yet let me weep for such a feeling loss .
Has this fellow no feeling of his business ?
Thou art not by mine eye , Lysander , found .
I am scarce in breath , my lord .
It shall advantage more than do us wrong .
Yea , and text underneath : "Here dwells Benedick the married man" ?
Oh , quick , or I am gone .
Bring it to that , The gold I give thee will I melt and pour Down thy ill-uttering throat .
What , did he marry me to famish me ?
Never anger Made good guard for itself .
The very instant that I saw you did My heart fly to your service , there resides To make me slave to it , and for your sake Am I this patient log-man .
The people knows it , and have now received His accusations .
Here comes the man , sir , that did rescue me .
His name's Cinna .
Hear his speech but say thou nought .
An I may hide my face , let me play Thisbe too !
And I do know by this they stay for me In Pompey's porch .
And , sir , tonight I do entreat that we may sup together .
Take thou that .
If the matter were good , my lord , I durst swear it were his .
Prescribe not us our duty .
Mend the instance , shepherd .
Why , I think so .
What should we say , my lord ?
Be collected .
Since this fortune falls to you , Be content and seek no new .
Was ever match clapped up so suddenly ?
How did you find the quarrel on the seventh cause ?
Thou hast my love .
No more a soldier .
Now to you .
How fares our cousin Hamlet ?
There is no other shelter hereabouts .
Then I will give you the serving creature .
Who hath relieved you ?
Prithee , say on .
But I am much to blame .
But the rarity of it is , which is indeed almost beyond credit , As many vouched rarities are .
But art not thou thyself giddy with the fashion too , that thou hast shifted out of thy tale into telling me of the fashion ?
How think you of it ?
It is a monster Begot upon itself , born on itself .
These both put off , a poor petitioner , A care-crazed mother to a many sons , A beauty-waning and distressed widow , Even in the afternoon of her best days , Made prize and purchase of his wanton eye , Seduced the pitch and height of his degree To base declension and loathed bigamy .
A heavy summons lies like lead upon me , And yet I would not sleep .
I know not , madam .
And so far blameless proves my enterprise , That I have 'nointed an Athenian's eyes .
If the heavens had been pleased , would we had so ended !
If love be rough with you , be rough with love .
Rather approach'd too late !
But canst thou guess that he doth aim at it ?
But , tell me , where is princely Richmond now ?
The best in this kind are but shadows , and the worst are no worse if imagination amend them .
Nurse !
A soothsayer bids you beware the ides of March .
I will challenge him .
The foul fiend haunts Poor Tom in the voice of a nightingale .
Wisely and slow .
It looks a little paler .
His captain's heart , Which in the scuffles of great fights hath burst The buckles on his breast , reneges all temper And is become the bellows and the fan To cool a gypsy's lust .
I had it of him .
Hence , away !
Truly , I have him , but I would not be the party that should desire you to touch him , for his biting is immortal .
For that goes hard .
Amen , amen to that fair prayer , say I .
Made I him king for this ?
What is it else ?
Ready .
I shall , King Harry .
That defense thou hast , betake thee to 't .
How 'gree you now ?
We defy augury .
Most heartily I do beseech the court To give the judgment .
Caesar did write for him to come to Rome .
If you desire the spleen , and will laugh yourself into stitches , follow me .
I am content you shall entreat me stay , But yet not stay , entreat me how you can .
O Romeo , Romeo !
But have I not cause to weep ?
If there be any good thing to be done That may to thee do ease and grace to me , Speak to me .
Speak .
What , is Antonio here ?
I prithee now , lead the way without any more talking. , Trinculo , the king and all our company else being drowned , we will inherit here. , Here , bear my bottle. , Fellow Trinculo , we'll fill him by and by again .
Excellent .
Come hither , fellow .
One .
No , no , the bell .
Indeed , he is so .
Both with an Ah , mocker , that's the dog's name .
Not yet .
A victory is twice itself when the achiever brings home full numbers .
This is as strange a maze as e'er men trod , And there is in this business more than nature Was ever conduct of .
I doubt not that , since we are well-persuaded We carry not a heart with us from hence That grows not in a fair consent with ours , Nor leave not one behind that doth not wish Success and conquest to attend on us .
Sweet masters , be patient .
This looks not like a nuptial .
Thy reason , man ?
Do you quarrel , sir ?
At my lodging .
I love thee not .
She said so .
O excellent young man !
Why , 'tis not possible .
If then true lovers have been ever crossed , It stands as an edict in destiny .
Come , temperate nymphs , and help to celebrate A contract of true love .
Honest , my lord ?
Strike on the tinder , ho !
At your noble pleasure .
Down , and swear .
Is 't frailty that thus errs ?
I will expect you .
O braggart vile and damned furious wight , The grave doth gape , and doting death is near .
Fool , fool , fool , I say !
The wine she drinks is made of grapes .
Swear by her foot , that she may tread out the oath .
Where is that damned villain , Tranio , That faced and braved me in this matter so ?
Pardon , sweet father .
The heavens themselves blaze forth the death of princes .
Grim-visaged war hath smoothed his wrinkled front ; And now , instead of mounting barbed steeds To fright the souls of fearful adversaries , He capers nimbly in a lady's chamber To the lascivious pleasing of a lute .
Ay .
Let go , slave , or thou diest !
Upon my life , she finds , although I can not , Myself to be a marv'lous proper man .
So please your Lordship to accept our duty .
What is the reason of this terrible summons ?
You are early stirring .
Now , my Titania , wake you , my sweet queen .
Lorenzo and Salerio , welcome hither , If that the youth of my new interest here Have power to bid you welcome .
O you gods !
Here comes the little villain .
And therefore , I pray thee , news .
To prayers , to prayers , all lost !
Good name in man and woman , dear my lord , Is the immediate jewel of their souls .
I have told him , Lepidus was grown too cruel , That he his high authority abused And did deserve his change .
Thou seest the world , Volumnius , how it goes .
Yes , something you can deny for your own safety : you have been a great thief by sea .
You must bear with me .
I am sorry For your displeasure , but all will sure be well .
Out of my sight !
Alas the day !
They follow the king's pleasure .
No , by mine honor , madam .
Tomorrow will I send .
Get you all three into the boxtree .
Look to my chattels and my movables .
Make you a wholesome answer .
But , sir , such wanton , wild , and usual slips
Then have my lips the sin that they have took .
Thou hast .
A gallant curtal-axe upon my thigh , A boar-spear in my hand , and in my heart Lie there what hidden woman's fear there will , We'll have a swashing and a martial outside , As many other mannish cowards have That do outface it with their semblances .
Your voice shall be as strong as any man's In the disposing of new dignities .
Wherein the toged consuls can propose As masterly as he .
You would lift the moon out of her sphere if she would continue in it five weeks without changing .
Since that respects and fortunes are his love , I shall not be his wife .
Therefore forbear awhile .
Oh , heaven have mercy on me !
I must confess your offer is the best , And , let your father make her the assurance , She is your own ; else , you must pardon me .
To what end , my lord ?
No doubt , no doubt .
Myself am Naples , Who with mine eyes , never since at ebb , beheld The king my father wracked .
Did 't not wake you ?
What a strange drowsiness possesses them !
Such news , my lord , as grieves me to report .
I am cut to th ' brains .
Look , here comes Helena .
How long hath he been there ?
How now , my hearts !
I'll bring you to him .
I think I hear them. , Stand , ho !
Let four captains Bear Hamlet like a soldier to the stage , For he was likely , had he been put on , To have proved most royally .
Apothecary !
I will be hanged else !
Your Majesty , hear now , saving your Majesty's manhood , what an arrant , rascally , beggarly , lousy knave it is .
But , like a misbehaved and sullen wench , Thou pout'st upon thy fortune and thy love .
Now , fellows , you are welcome .
Nay , I care not for their names .
Why , so I did , but looked for no reply .
Fairer than tongue can name thee , let me have Some patient leisure to excuse myself .
Now my charms are all o'erthrown , And what strength I have's mine own , Which is most faint .
Let's see once more this saying graved in gold , "Who chooseth me shall gain what many men desire." Why , that's the lady .
Antonio shall become bound , well .
Not a whit , Touchstone .
The pale companion is not for our pomp .
Your cake there is warm within ; you stand here in the cold .
The chaplain of the Tower hath buried them , But where , to say the truth , I do not know .
Enough .
Thou shalt find That I'll resume the shape which thou dost think I have cast off for ever .
Arise .
Where is my lord ?
Hear me , recreant !
I'll to my charge .
An apple , cleft in two , is not more twin Than these two creatures .
No , believe me .
We know thy charge , Brakenbury , and will obey .
Dishonor not your mothers .
Twelve year since , Miranda , twelve year since , Thy father was the Duke of Milan and A prince of power .
I am a tainted wether of the flock , Meetest for death .
Here they'll be , man .
First , madam , he is well .
Let's stab ourselves .
There could I have him now , and there , and there again , and there .
They would not have you to stir forth today .
What's that , I pray ?
Never , my lord .
Monster , lay to your fingers .
Tis even so , For let our finger ache and it endues Our other healthful members even to that sense Of pain .
You wrong me more , sir , in denying it .
I do beseech you , sir , trouble yourself no further .
Nay , their endeavor keeps in the wonted pace .
Lysander , speak again !
No more , cousin .
Follow me not .
It were a tedious difficulty , I think , To bring them to that prospect .
Edgar I nothing am .
How canst thou urge God's dreadful law to us When thou hast broke it in such dear degree ?
Then , to answer every man directly and briefly , wisely and truly , wisely I say , I am a bachelor .
It were a delicate stratagem to shoe A troop of horse with felt .
How yet resolves the governor of the town ?
Beat them down !

God keep me so. , Our heralds go with him .
Grandam , one night as we did sit at supper , My uncle Rivers talked how I did grow More than my brother : "Ay , " quoth my uncle Gloucester , "Small herbs have grace ; great weeds do grow apace." And since , methinks I would not grow so fast Because sweet flowers are slow and weeds make haste .
Good sir , this ring was given me by my wife .
Than my Lord Hastings no man might be bolder .
But little .
There's comfort yet ; they are assailable .
Approach and speak .
Either thou or I , or both , must go with him .
Come , we'll to sleep .
I ' faith , he'll have a lusty widow now That shall be wooed and wedded in a day .
Fie , how impatience loureth in your face .
You have some cause ; they have not .
Where is thy instrument ?
Methinks I could not die anywhere so contented as in the king's company , his cause being just and his quarrel honorable .
Who heard me to deny it or forswear it ?
I warrant thee .
Come , woo me , woo me , for now I am in a holiday humor , and like enough to consent .
Because we come to do you service and you think we are ruffians , you'll have your daughter covered with a Barbary horse .
Search , seek , and know how this foul murder comes .
O God !
Seven of my people , with an obedient start , make out for him .
Then I , and you , and all of us fell down , Whilst bloody treason flourished over us .
Rest you happy !
To be acknowledged , madam , is o'erpaid .
I did say so When first I raised the tempest .
Now heaven hath all ,
I will deserve your pains .
The money that you owe me for the chain .
Good night , good Captain Blunt .
He did ask favor .
We are enough yet living in the field To smother up the English in our throngs , If any order might be thought upon .
Where is my lord the duke of Gloucester ?
If there be truth in sight , you are my Rosalind .
It is worth the pains .
I assure you , Carthage .
Because their business still lies out o ' door .
No .
That will I do .
By the mass , I was about to say something .
Out upon it , old carrion !
I hid me under the dead mooncalf's gaberdine for fear of the storm .
Tis so .
To leave his wife , to leave his babes , His mansion and his titles in a place From whence himself does fly ?
I know not what 'twas but distraction .
Lo you , here she comes .
Ay , sir .
All this done , Repair to Pompey's porch , where you shall find us .
First , as you know , my house within the city Is richly furnished with plate and gold , Basins and ewers to lave her dainty hands ; My hangings all of Tyrian tapestry , In ivory coffers I have stuffed my crowns , In cypress chests my arras counterpoints , Costly apparel , tents , and canopies , Fine linen , Turkey cushions bossed with pearl , Valance of Venice gold in needlework , Pewter and brass , and all things that belong To house or housekeeping .
Not till God make men of some other metal than earth .
May be she doth but counterfeit .
How "strangely" ?
Farewell .
And mine shall .
Ancient , what makes he here ?
Is she as tall as me ?
Why should you think that I should woo in scorn ?
Brutus killed me .
Tush , fear not , man .
Who's there ?
I am for the air .
A merry whoreson , ha !
And that is Claudio .
Come , in what key shall a man take you to go in the song ?
O good Sir Toby , hold !
How doth the prince ?
There's other business for thee .
Tis not needed yet .
But are not some whole that we must make sick ?
Tis a strange serpent .
I find here that Don Pedro hath bestowed much honor on a young Florentine called Claudio .
Then hie you hence to Friar Lawrence's cell .
Sweets to the sweet .
Alack , my lord , what do you mean by that ?
Doth he not deserve well ?
If you be pleased , retire into my cell And there repose .
Say she be mute and will not speak a word ; Then I'll commend her volubility , And say she uttereth piercing eloquence .
He lies to th ' heart .
Ay , my lord , an 't please you .
I know that virtue to be in you , Brutus , As well as I do know your outward favor .
No , no , by God's good grace , his son shall reign .
My lord , I have news to tell you .
I will carry no crotchets .
Ophelia , walk you here .
Would you praise Caesar , say "Caesar." Go no further .
Is it for him you do envy me so ?
Hoo !
I am armed and well prepared. , Give me your hand , Bassanio .
You have seen nothing then ?
And you too , gentle Hero ?
Do not swear at all .
Here comes the lady .
How !
That will I make before I let thee go .
So shines a good deed in a naughty world .
And therefore tell me , most fair Katherine , will you have me ?
She's framed as fruitful As the free elements .
And patches will I get unto these cudgeled scars , And swear I got them in the Gallia wars .
But I pray you , who is his companion ?
I did not see you since you sent me hence , Home to the Centaur with the gold you gave me .
What shall be our sport , then ?
The wall , methinks , being sensible , should curse again .
But you'll lie like dogs , and yet say nothing neither .
Thanks , good Egeus .
How now , my metal of India ?
Go after her .
I'll fight till from my bones my flesh be hacked .
A dollar .
Where is Lucentio ?
Bid him levy straight The greatest strength and power that he can make And meet me suddenly at Salisbury .
Scratching could not make it worse an 'twere such a face as yours were .
At your kind'st leisure .
But I will acquaint my daughter withal , that she may be the better prepared for an answer if peradventure this be true .
Good morrow , noble sir .
What noise is this ?
This is a man's invention , and his hand .
Where the place ?
I can not speak to her , yet she urged conference .
I will not change my horse with any that treads but on four pasterns .
Let us to the great supper .
Then I will come to my mother by and by .
I think he will stand very strong with us .
The castle's gently rendered .
This dream is all amiss interpreted .
If ever thou wilt thrive , bury my body .
These are unsightly tricks .
Since that my beauty can not please his eye , I'll weep what's left away , and weeping die .
Alack , alack the day !
Launcelot and I are out .
Tyrants themselves wept when it was reported .
Sleeping and waking , O , defend me still !
Tis but thy name that is my enemy .
Well , I will forget the condition of my estate to rejoice in yours .
Make the doors upon a woman's wit , and it will out at the casement .
James Tyrrel , and your most obedient subject .
If he be perjured , see you now , his reputation is as arrant a villain and a Jack Sauce as ever his black shoe trod upon God's ground and His earth , in my conscience , la .
No , boy .
First , rehearse your song by rote , To each word a warbling note .
Slave !
And if your love Can labor ought in sad invention , Hang her an epitaph upon her tomb And sing it to her bones .
Tomorrow night look that thou lie alone .
And Trinculo is reeling ripe .
How goes it now ?
This is the man .
But wherefore , villain , didst thou kill my cousin ?
O , the kindest Kate !
That now I will have , that's the humor of it .
From helmet to the spur , all blood he was .
Is Decius Brutus and Trebonius there ?
I charge you , as you hope to have redemption , By Christ's dear blood shed for our grievous sins , That you depart , and lay no hands on me .
A vengeance on your crafty withered hide !
Here , mighty Theseus .
Take it in what sense thou wilt .
That a maiden's heart hath burned ?
To , to , to , To murder me ?
And we'll wear out In a walled prison packs and sects of great ones That ebb and flow by the moon .
And so it is .
Yet I beseech you , If you think fit , or that it may be done , Give me advantage of some brief discourse With Desdemona alone .
Not i ' th ' stocks , fool .
Come , some music !
My royal lord , You do not give the cheer .
You have obtained it .
I knew what you would prove .
I know thee well , a serviceable villain , As duteous to the vices of thy mistress As badness would desire .
Adieu , Till your return at night .
Your servant shall do so .
What raiment will your Honor wear today ?
And in the morn I'll bring you to your ship and so to Naples , Where I have hope to see the nuptial Of these our dear-beloved solemnized , And thence retire me to my Milan , where Every third thought shall be my grave .
It is the wittiest partition that ever I heard discourse , my lord .
I have full cause of weeping , but this heart Shall break into a hundred thousand flaws , Or ere I'll weep. , O Fool , I shall go mad !
Tell the clock there .
What is she ?
Yet you will be hanged for being so long absent .
Come on , sir knave , have done your foolishness , And tell me how thou hast disposed thy charge .
He received them Of him that brought them .
Censure me in your wisdom , and awake your senses that you may the better judge .
I hope you will consider what is spoke Comes from my love .
Let him alone .
O fair Katherine , if you will love me soundly with your French heart , I will be glad to hear you confess it brokenly with your English tongue .
My lord , he doth deny to come .
The mind I sway by and the heart I bear Shall never sag with doubt nor shake with fear .
Lady , come from that nest Of death , contagion , and unnatural sleep .
I see you do not mean to part with her , Or else you like not of my company .
One that old Frederick , your father , loves .
O , my fair cousin , I must not say so .
I think their inhibition comes by the means of the late innovation .
Thou art a fellow of a good respect .
I do the wrong , and first begin to brawl .
Is it so , countrymen ?
Lend me a looking-glass .
O sir , pardon me !
What though I be not so in grace as you , So hung upon with love , so fortunate , But miserable most , to love unloved ?
Mark Antony I served , who best was worthy Best to be served .
I am satisfied .
By mine honor , in true English , I love thee , Kate .
Ay , my lord .
There !
I hope you do not mean to cheat me so .
This is old Ninny's tomb .
What profane wretch art thou ?
Know I these men that come along with you ?
Then she is well , and nothing can be ill .
Oh , yet I do repent me of my fury , That I did kill them .
And every object that might make me fear Misfortune to my ventures out of doubt Would make me sad .
But , alas , Caesar must bleed for it .
Do thy office .
Doth the moon shine that night we play our play ?
How ?
Romeo .
What , to perverseness ?
So should he look That seems to speak things strange .
My naked weapon is out .
O , no , he loves me , and he holds me dear .
Where are his eyes ?
Helen , it is not so .
Bear him my head .
I pray God he be not , I say .
My cousin Westmoreland ?
Two of them have the very bent of honor , And if their wisdoms be misled in this , The practice of it lives in John the Bastard , Whose spirits toil in frame of villainies .
I thank you for your company , but , good faith , I had as lief have been myself alone .
To thee I do commend my watchful soul , Ere I let fall the windows of mine eyes .
I know the boy will well usurp the grace , Voice , gait , and action of a gentlewoman .
Then forth , dear countrymen .
Ride , ride , Messala , ride , and give these bills Unto the legions on the other side .
but you see my finger Hath not the ring upon it .
Well , you are gone both ways .
Sir , I say to you it is thought you are false knaves .
But , for true need , You heavens , give me that patience , patience I need .
Is 't so , my lords of England ?
Did you say all ?
Hark you , sir .
In troth , I think I should , and undo 't when I had done .
Tell him I'll knock his leek about his pate Upon Saint Davy's day .
O Cleopatra !
White-livered runagate , what doth he there ?
Now , my lord , what shall we do , if we perceive Lord Hastings will not yield to our complots ?
When my tongue blabs , then let mine eyes not see .
Lo , here upon thy cheek the stain doth sit Of an old tear that is not washed off yet .
Bellario greets your grace .
The one I'll stay , the other stayeth me .
They all do hate him As rootedly as I .
I'll make the motion .
Ay , I praise God , and I have merited some love at his hands .
Have I not heard the sea , puffed up with winds , Rage like an angry boar chafed with sweat ?
It is well .
They are of Norway , sir .
Beware the thane of Fife .
No more !
How oddly he is suited !
Where's satisfaction ?
So said , so done , is well .
Besides , his cote , his flocks , and bounds of feed Are now on sale , and at our sheepcote now , By reason of his absence , there is nothing That you will feed on .
So doth the greater glory dim the less .
Well , that is the dowry of his wife ; 'tis none of his own getting .
Alack , what noise is this ?
Here I am .
Even what it please my lord that shall become him .
And in part him , but , " you may say , "not well .
He plies the duke at morning and at night , And doth impeach the freedom of the state If they deny him justice .
For lead ?
Leave him to my displeasure. , Edmund , keep you our sister company .
The dearest ring in Venice will I give you , And find it out by proclamation .
Therefore I'll sleep again .
Here , sir , a ring she bid me give you , sir .
As woman's love .
A good note , that keeps you from the blow of the law .
Welcome , my lord .
Signior Baptista , my business asketh haste , And every day I can not come to woo .
Thou know'st the first time that we smell the air We wawl and cry .
Not I , unless the breath of heartsick groans , Mistlike , infold me from the search of eyes .
Still it cried , "Sleep no more ! " to all the house .
Take up the bodies .
Say to me whose fortunes shall rise higher , Caesar's or mine ?
But it becomes me well enough , does 't not ?
To Baptista Minola .
I am a Jew .
Those that "Hobgoblin" call you , and "sweet Puck , " You do their work , and they shall have good luck .
Now , my Lord Constable ?
Am I a coward ?
Make we our march towards Birnam .
It hath no tongue to vex you .
Madam !
Ay , go your ways , go your ways .
Urge the necessity and state of times , And be not peevish found in great designs .
This is his second fit .
Lay on , Macduff , And damned be him that first cries , "Hold , enough ! " I would the friends we miss were safe arrived .
Pray thee , marry us .
Go , Eros , send his treasure after .
Let him write down the Prince's officer "coxcomb." Come , bind them. , Thou naughty varlet !
The trick of that voice I do well remember .
It were pity to cast them away for nothing , though between them and a great cause they should be esteemed nothing .
The fiend is rough and will not be roughly used .
I see the ruin of my house .
Many a man would take you at your word And go indeed , having so good a mean .
How now ?
I hold you but a subject of this war , Not as a brother .
This lanthorn doth the horned moon present .
For us , we will consider of this further .
Let me still take away the harms I fear , Not fear still to be taken .
Huntsman , I charge thee , tender well my hounds .
And yet thou wilt tutor me from quarreling !
Some villains of my court Are of consent and sufferance in this .
O Margaret , Margaret , now thy heavy curse Is lighted on poor Hastings ' wretched head .
It does , my boy .
How now , masters ?
Learn of the wise and perpend : civet is of a baser birth than tar , the very uncleanly flux of a cat .
Peace , peace !
Eyes , do you see ?
So all .
What , Octavia ?
You know tomorrow is the wedding day .
It follows , then , the cat must stay at home .
He hath a heart as sound as a bell , and his tongue is the clapper , for what his heart thinks , his tongue speaks .
Who is 't you mean ?
Talk not to me .
Thus do they , sir : they take the flow o' th' Nile By certain scales i' th' Pyramid .
I can not tell .
I pray you , what is he ?
Sir , she can turn , and turn , and yet go on , And turn again .
I'll to the throng .
I have a widow aunt , a dowager Of great revenue , and she hath no child .
He is the brooch indeed And gem of all the nation .
Must she not then be answered ?
I'll fetch the general's surgeon. , Save you your labor. , He that lies slain here , Cassio , Was my dear friend .
He will , an if he live to be a man .
But I pray you , tell me , is my boy , God rest his soul , alive or dead ?
Come , come .
Why do you speak so faintly ?
Do Poor Tom some charity , whom the foul fiend vexes .
Nay , as they dare .
Freedom !
Breathe Merriman , the poor cur is embossed , And couple Clowder with the deep-mouthed brach .
He longs to eat the English .
Oh , thou art wise !
Your virtue is my privilege .
Come , my spade .
Dost thou love pictures ?
But Brutus says he was ambitious , And Brutus is an honorable man .
Away !
Give me some wine and let me speak a little .
What's the matter , think you ?
The rest shall keep as they are .
Thou , wretched boy , that didst consort him here Shalt with him hence .
I ' faith , I am sorry that thou art not well .
and but I be deceived , Signior Baptista may remember me , Near twenty years ago , in Genoa , Where we were lodgers at the Pegasus .
I could not find him at the Elephant .
Strike !
Moreover , urge his hateful luxury And bestial appetite in change of lust , Which stretched to their servants , daughters , wives , Even where his raging eye or savage heart , Without control , lusted to make his prey .
I dare swear he is no hypocrite but prays from his heart .
This is the foul fiend Flibbertigibbet .
Ay , sir , it is too true , God help the while .
Fled to his house amazed .
The sight of lovers feedeth those in love .
Ay , my lord .
Yet there he was , and there I found this credit , That he did range the town to seek me out .
I have received a hurt .
Ay , but not rough enough .
Proceed .
Because , look you , you do not love it , nor your affections and your appetites and your digestions does not agree with it , I would desire you to eat it .
Speak , is 't out o ' th ' way ?
Forbear to sleep the nights , and fast the days ; Compare dead happiness with living woe ; Think that thy babes were sweeter than they were , And he that slew them fouler than he is .
Then we are rid of Litio .
Say you so ?
Oh , wonderful !
The fiend is strong within him .
And the queen too , and that presently .
Are they good ?
Why , there's no remedy .
Where goes Cesario ?
This man hath had good counsel , a hundred knights !
The captain that did bring me first on shore Hath my maid's garments .
You should for that have reprehended him .
I do serve you in this business .
Take what wife you will to bed , I will ever be your head .
It was , so please your highness .
Speak not of Helena .
Who's there ?
Then , you conclude , my grandam , he is dead .
Did you and he consent in Cassio's death ?
Your love says , like an honest gentleman , and a courteous , and a kind , and a handsome , and , I warrant , a virtuous , Where is your mother ?
Flower of this purple dye , Hit with Cupid's archery , Sink in apple of his eye .
Do as thou wilt , for I have done with thee .
I can not think my sister in the least Would fail her obligation .
Boy !
Well said , old mole !
Yea , sir , we hope .
This , Casca .
To answer that , I should confess to you .
Very well mended .
What did you enact ?
If she find him not , To England send him or confine him where Your wisdom best shall think .
Besides , their writers say , King Pepin , which deposed Childeric , Did , as heir general , being descended Of Blithild , which was daughter to King Clothair , Make claim and title to the crown of France .
Thou hast railed on thyself .
Nor I .
Nay , but say true , does it work upon him ?
Ay , and wisely .
Pray you , keep seat .
There are my keys. , But wherefore should I go ?
For , sir , It is as sure as you are Roderigo , Were I the Moor , I would not be Iago .
Could not a worm , an adder , do so much ?
Dost thou understand me , man ?
This will I also wear in my cap .
Why then , can one desire too much of a good thing ? , Come , sister , you shall be the priest and marry us. , Give me your hand , Orlando. , What do you say , sister ?
Throw this slave Upon the dunghill. , Regan , I bleed apace .
That I have , lady .
Most like a gentleman .
Bettering thy loss makes the bad causer worse .
I will do everything that thou wilt have me .
Is your man secret ?
How comes that ?
I must be cruel only to be kind .
And pity to the general wrong of Rome , As fire drives out fire , so pity pity , Hath done this deed on Caesar .
And most chirurgeonly .
There's but one down .
O my dear lord , Nay , do not think I flatter .
I have perceived a most faint neglect of late , which I have rather blamed as mine own jealous curiosity than as a very pretense and purpose of unkindness .
Let thy blood and spirit embrace them .
Thy name is Gloucester .
By heaven , I'll make a ghost of him that lets me .
Amen !
So you shall .
But cheer thy heart , and be thou not dismayed .
God grant we never may have need of you .
And is 't not to be damned To let this canker of our nature come In further evil ?
What say you ?
A pair of stocks , you rogue !
Our preparation stands In expectation of them .
Go , girl , seek happy nights to happy days .
The Queen approaches .
I'll serve this duke .
But this is from my commission .
Well , honor is the subject of my story .
I can stay with Regan , I and my hundred knights .
My brother killed no man ; his fault was thought , And yet his punishment was bitter death .
At mine unworthiness , that dare not offer What I desire to give , and much less take What I shall die to want .
In great measure .
Well then , it now appears you need my help .
So bless thee , master .
Your father was ever virtuous , and holy men at their death have good inspirations .
Tomorrow will it please you to be crowned ?
For both our sakes , I would that word were true .
To take 't again perforce , Monster ingratitude !
O Lord , they fight !
Perchance till after Theseus ' wedding day .
I'll not expostulate with her , lest her body and beauty unprovide my mind again , This night , Iago !
Bad news , my lord .
Seven days and nights ?
You shall see anon how the murderer gets the love of Gonzago's wife .
In faith , she's too curst .
Mercy but murders , pardoning those that kill .
I could munch your good dry oats .
We are arrant knaves , all .
If he fail of that , He will have other means to cut you off .
Pray you now , forget and forgive .
I can behold no longer .
Indeed , he hath an excellent good name .
Their lips were four red roses on a stalk , And in their summer beauty kissed each other .
Behold , there stand the caskets , noble Prince .
For women are as roses , whose fair flower Being once displayed , doth fall that very hour .
As willingly as e'er I came from school .
Armed , brother ?
Therefore , hear me , Hermia .
What impossible matter will he make easy next ?
Be large in mirth .
I did love you once .
A ship you sent me to , to hire waftage .
Good my lord , vouchsafe me a word with you .
But life , being weary of these worldly bars , Never lacks power to dismiss itself .
She ate no meat today , nor none shall eat .
Or to be naked with her friend in bed An hour or more , not meaning any harm ?
I commend my duty to your lordship .
I do not know .
First , good Peter Quince , say what the play treats on , then read the names of the actors , and so grow to a point .
Bassanio told him he would make some speed Of his return .
What need one ?
God keep you from them , and from such false friends .
Ay , boy .
Go to , then .
Oh , these men , these men !
If it please His Majesty , 'tis the breathing time of day with me .
The point envenomed too ! , Then , venom , to thy work .
And you , good sir .
Let them begin .
Messala , I have here received letters That young Octavius and Mark Antony Come down upon us with a mighty power , Bending their expedition toward Philippi .
Is she not proud ?
What's the matter ?
A daughter ?
A witty mother !
If a man's brains were in 's heels , were 't not in danger of kibes ?
Here , sir ! " You loggerheaded and unpolished grooms !
I pray you , sirs , lie in my tent and sleep .
Advise the duke where you are going , to a most festinate preparation .
Fare thee well .
Here , Peter Quince .
Come then and take the last warmth of my lips .
Whereby hangs a tale , sir ?
Marry , heaven forbid !
There were none principal .
Where's the king ?
No boasting like a fool .
I pray thee , chide not .
So they do nothing , 'tis a venial slip .
I stay too long .
I confess it is my shame to be so fond , but it is not in my virtue to amend it .
Things that are past are done , with me .
There's not a one of them but in his house I keep a servant fee'd .
He did comply , sir , with his dug before he sucked it .
Stay , Jaques , stay .
And be a happy mother by the deed .
What is here ?
I left no ring with her .
Peter !
I will not desire that .
I have sent to bid Cassio come speak with you .
It is indifferent cold , my lord , indeed .
Mechanic slaves With greasy aprons , rules , and hammers shall Uplift us to the view .
Well , I will thither .
Adieu .
Be patient , gentlemen .
What's the noise ?
To who ?
And the rarest that e'er came there .
Were I my father , coz , would I do this ?
Or , if you do not , make the bridal bed In that dim monument where Tybalt lies .
I prithee , recount some of them .
Methinks it is like a weasel .
I go .
This is not yet an Alexandrian feast .
Base Trojan , thou shalt die .
A poor unfortunate beggar .
Good Margaret , run thee to the parlor .
As the time , the place , and the condition of this country stands , I could heartily wish this had not befallen .
I am come To bid my king and master aye good night .
Run away , I pray you !
Also King Lewis the Tenth , Who was sole heir to the usurper Capet , Could not keep quiet in his conscience , Wearing the crown of France , till satisfied That fair Queen Isabel , his grandmother , Was lineal of the Lady Ermengare , Daughter to Charles the foresaid duke of Lorraine , By the which marriage the line of Charles the Great Was reunited to the crown of France .
Have you not spoken 'gainst the Duke of Cornwall aught ?
No , truly not , although until last night I have this twelvemonth been her bedfellow .
By my hand I swear , and my father's soul , the work ish ill done .
If I could add a lie unto a fault I would deny it .
Why , in good time .
Macbeth !
By Jove , I am not covetous for gold Nor care I who doth feed upon my cost ; It yearns me not if men my garments wear ; Such outward things dwell not in my desires .
He needs as many , sir , as Caesar has , Or needs not us .
Marry , I'll teach you .
Now , Charmian !
Welcome , my lord .
I'll not fail , if I live .
Portia , what mean you ?
A wreck past hope he was .
The ears are senseless that should give us hearing , To tell him his commandment is fulfilled , That Rosencrantz and Guildenstern are dead .
Love looks not with the eyes but with the mind .
Where is Antony ?
Thou drunken slave , I sent thee for a rope And told thee to what purpose and what end .
I will condole in some measure. , To the rest. , Yet my chief humor is for a tyrant .
Desist , and drink .
A very mean meaning .
Remember me." I have sworn 't .
That I'll try .
I little thought You would have followed .
Caesar , thy thoughts Touch their effects in this .
One inch of delay more is a South Sea of discovery .
The news is true , my lord .
Dost thou lie still ?
God save the foundation !
Good madonna , give me leave to prove you a fool .
I will be brief , for my short date of breath Is not so long as is a tedious tale .
We will haste us .
If I say sooth , I must report they were As cannons overcharged with double cracks , So they doubly redoubled strokes upon the foe .
Knock you here , sir ?
It is .
Although I joy in thee , I have no joy of this contract tonight .
Many a morning hath he there been seen , With tears augmenting the fresh morning's dew , Adding to clouds more clouds with his deep sighs .
By my faith , he is very swift and sententious .
Tonight in Harfleur will we be your guest ; Tomorrow for the march are we addressed .
I will hear Cassius and compare their reasons When severally we hear them rendered .
I will run , fiend .
Do you know me , my lord ?
Marry , peace it bodes , and love , and quiet life , And awful rule , and right supremacy , And , to be short , what not that's sweet and happy ?
I do not know dat .
Since the youth of the count's was today with thy lady , she is much out of quiet .
Call them again .
Romeo , he cries aloud , "Hold , friends !
Tedious it were to tell and harsh to hear .
Though all things foul would wear the brows of grace , Yet grace must still look so .
O , by your leave , I pray you , I bade you never speak again of him .
Well then , the peace which you before so urged Lies in his answer .
She is damned for it .
Let me go .
Thou and thy meaner fellows your last service Did worthily perform , and I must use you In such another trick .
What would you , Desdemona ?
But thy vile race , Though thou didst learn , had that in 't which good natures Could not abide to be with .
Art thou aught else but place , degree , and form , Creating awe and fear in other men , Wherein thou art less happy , being feared , Than they in fearing ?
We will .
Hark , come hither , Tyrrel .
Bring us the letter .
Then bid adieu to me , and say the tears Belong to Egypt .
I may say "thrusting" it , For piercing steel and darts envenomed Shall be as welcome to the ears of Brutus As tidings of this sight .
Well , daughter , and you gentlewomen all , Withdraw into a chamber by yourselves , And when I send for you , come hither masked .
His name , my lord , is Tyrrel .
I will seek Some way to leave him .
I can as well be hanged as tell the manner of it .
By my troth , I am sick .
Call in my gentlewoman .
Some officers take them away .
Youth to itself rebels , though none else near .
Lives he ?
I will not till I please .
Bid them move away .
I warrant something from Venice .
He lies tonight within seven leagues of Rome .
She's a most triumphant lady , if report be square to her .
And when goes hence ?
We will be married o ' Sunday .
Not I , believe me .
Nay , hear them , Antony .
No .
Who stays it still withal ?
You are welcome , sir , to Cyprus .
An if I could , what should I get therefore ?
Nay , take my life and all .
Speak to us .
But shall I live in hope ?
Away !
If I myself , there is no hour so fit As Caesar's death's hour , nor no instrument Of half that worth as those your swords , made rich With the most noble blood of all this world .
Go fetch it , sister .
No , I'll not weep .
Then comes the time , who lives to see 't , That going shall be used with feet .
What need the bridge much broader than the flood ?

My powers are crescent , and my auguring hope Says it will come to th' full .
And she as much in love , her means much less To meet her new beloved anywhere .

But here they come .
Thou didst usurp my place , and dost thou not Usurp the just proportion of my sorrow ?
Take you some company , and away to horse .
Oh , brave Iago , honest and just , That hast such noble sense of thy friend's wrong !
If you will see it , follow me .
I shall do well .
Tis hot , it smokes .

Quoth my master .
From me , whose love was of that dignity That it went hand in hand even with the vow I made to her in marriage , and to decline Upon a wretch whose natural gifts were poor To those of mine .
Yet at the first I saw the treasons planted .
The arbitrament is like to be bloody .
A tailor make a man ?
How now , my love ?
Answer my life my judgment , Thy youngest daughter does not love thee least , Nor are those empty-hearted whose low sound Reverbs no hollowness .
With all my heart .
That young swain that you saw here but erewhile , That little cares for buying anything .

That's all .
Perchance she can not meet him .
Speak .
Well have you heard , but something hard of hearing .
Believe me for mine honor , and have respect to mine honor that you may believe .
We are yet but young in deed .
What's to say ?

Get you to bed again .
I'll call upon you ere you go to bed And tell you what I know .

Will you give thanks , sweet Kate , or else shall I ? , What's this ?
There needs no ghost , my lord , come from the grave To tell us this .
My heart prays for him , though my tongue do curse .

Call 'em .
Not I .

I , sir ?
Why came not the slave back to me when I called him .
Therefore my merchandise makes me not sad .
As hell , Sir Topas .
If it were so , it was a grievous fault , And grievously hath Caesar answered it .

Methinks you are my glass , and not my brother : I see by you I am a sweet-faced youth .
Once more , good night , kind lords and gentlemen .
