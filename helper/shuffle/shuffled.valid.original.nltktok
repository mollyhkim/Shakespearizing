Who are they ?
But we are prevented .
I can write very like my lady your niece : on a forgotten matter we can hardly make distinction of our hands .
Do thy office .
If this fall into thy hand , revolve .
Wherefore are these things hid ?
They say he has been fencer to the Sophy .
You do mistake me , sir .
About your years , my lord .
A coward , a most devout coward , religious in it .
Like aqua vitae with a midwife .
What are you ?
Then you are mad indeed , if you be no better in your wits than a fool .
It may be worth thy pains , for I can sing And speak to him in many sorts of music That will allow me very worth his service .
Challenge me the count's youth to fight with him .
Go look after him .
Let him be the devil , an he will , I care not .
It is perchance that you yourself were saved .
Madam , there is at the gate a young gentleman much desires to speak with you .
Hold , sir , here's my purse .
The house will be the quieter .
I tell thee , I am as well in my wits as any man in Illyria .
There lies your way , due west .
I would we were well rid of this knavery .
Fie , thou dishonest Satan !
Sir Topas !
Look where the youngest wren of nine comes .
Antonio never yet was thief or pirate , Though , I confess , on base and ground enough , Orsino's enemy .
An your ladyship will have it as it ought to be , you must allow Prithee , read i ' thy right wits .
I do assure you , 'tis against my will .
I am no fighter .
How dost thou , my good fellow ?
Good , good .
A blank , my lord .
Who you are and what you would are out of my welkin , I might say "element , " but the word is overworn .
Let him send no more , Unless perchance you come to me again To tell me how he takes it .
What news from her ?
If it will not , what remedy ?
To the Elephant .
Most certain .
Do not desire to see this letter .
Pray you , sir , do you know of this matter ?
Thou shalt not choose but go .
I will answer you with gait and entrance .
This is the air , that is the glorious sun .
What shall we do else ?
Fare thee well .
I mean , she is the list of my voyage .
Away with him !
If it be thus to dream , still let me sleep !
If you offend him , I for him defy you .
Madam , I come to whet your gentle thoughts On his behalf .
By this hand , they are scoundrels and substractors that say so of him .
Where is Malvolio ?
Ay , sir , we are some of her trappings .
I told him you were asleep .
Virtue is beauty , but the beauteous evil Are empty trunks o'erflourished by the devil .
He is very well-favored , and he speaks very shrewishly .
Sir , no .
I think oxen and wainropes can not hale them together .
The gentleman will , for his honor's sake , have one bout with you .
O , welcome , father !
And wished to see thee cross-gartered." Cross-gartered ?
A good note , that keeps you from the blow of the law .
Is 't so saucy ?
How now , mistress ?
I'll ride home tomorrow , Sir Toby .
I will prove it legitimate , sir , upon the oaths of judgment and reason .
Did you never see the picture of "We Three" ?
What might you think ?
He named Sebastian .
Be curst and brief .
How now , gentleman ?
I will do everything that thou wilt have me .
Here is yet a postscript .
Alas , sir , be patient .
I'll ride your horse as well as I ride you .
Sir Topas , Sir Topas , good Sir Topas , go to my lady , Out , hyperbolical fiend !
Not yet old enough for a man , nor young enough for a boy , as a squash is before 'tis a peascod , or a codling when 'tis almost an apple .
Why , this is excellent .
A false conclusion .
And some have greatness thrust upon them." Heaven restore thee !
Signior Fabian , stay you by this gentleman till my return .
His employment between his lord and my niece confirms no less .
Here comes the fool , i ' faith .
Thy Fates open their hands .
What is decreed must be , and be this so .
What think you of this fool , Malvolio ?
When did I see thee so put down ?
Are you a comedian ?
Tis not so sweet now as it was before .
Jove , I thank thee !
Art thou a churchman ?
Have you any commission from your lord to negotiate with my face ?
Nay , I'll come .
Will you deny me now ?
I must obey .
I am a fellow o ' th ' strangest mind i ' th ' world .
Thou canst not choose but know who I am .
Lead me on .
Ay , madam .
Go shake your ears !
If my lady have not called up her steward Malvolio and bid him turn you out of doors , never trust me .
Ay , is 't , I warrant him .
I may command where I adore." Why , she may command me .
Give me your hand , sir .
The Count's gentleman , one Cesario .
His very genius hath taken the infection of the device , man .
Here , wear this jewel for me .
Observe him , for the love of mockery , for I know this letter will make a contemplative idiot of him .
Not so , sir , I do care for something .
Here come the officers .
Then lead the way , good father ; and heavens so shine That they may fairly note this act of mine .
The competitors enter .
Farewell .
Here , madam , at your service .
With the same 'havior that your passion bears Goes on my master's grief .
This is a dear manikin to you , Sir Toby .
Why appear you with this ridiculous boldness before my lady ?
Even so quickly may one catch the plague ?
Nay , if you be an undertaker , I am for you .
Ay , madam , well , for I was bred and born Not three hours ' travel from this very place .
And so perchance may he be .
For him , I think not on him .
Your cousin , my lady , takes great exceptions to your ill hours .
We'll whisper o'er a couplet or two of most sage saws .
Shall we rouse the night owl in a catch that will draw three souls out of one weaver ?
You are well fleshed .
Welcome , ass .
Pursue him and entreat him to a peace .
One would think his mother's milk were scarce out of him .
Sooth , but you must .
What , what ?
Even now , sir .
It doth not fit me .
My lord and master loves you .
M" , Malvolio .
As plain as I see you now .
To the gates of Tartar , thou most excellent devil of wit !
What is your parentage ? " "Above my fortunes , yet my state is well .
Well , God give them wisdom that have it .
No , believe me .
If it be so , as 'tis , Poor lady , she were better love a dream .
Take the fool away .
Away !
My master , not myself , lacks recompense .
My purpose is , indeed , a horse of that color .
You shall hear more .
Would it be better , madam , than I am ?
I would be loath to cast away my speech , for besides that it is excellently well penned , I have taken great pains to con it .
I prithee , vent thy folly somewhere else .
Perchance he is not drown'd. , What think you , sailors ?
Thy reason , man ?
A good lenten answer .
Can you do it ?
Good gentle one , give me modest assurance if you be the lady of the house , that I may proceed in my speech .
Maria once told me she did affect me , and I have heard herself come thus near , that , should she fancy , it should be one of my complexion .
My masters , are you mad ?
My lady will hang thee for thy absence .
I saw thee late at the Count Orsino's .
Talkest thou nothing but of ladies ?
Tis too late to go to bed now .
And on the answer , he pays you as surely as your feet hit the ground they step on .
Fare thee well .
Madam , the young gentleman of the Count Orsino's is returned .
Get him to bed , and let his hurt be looked to .
Your will ?
Ay , Biddy , come with me. , What , man !
I marvel your ladyship takes delight in such a barren rascal .
She's a beagle , true-bred , and one that adores me .
Or what are you ?
If I think so , I think the same of you .
Above my fortunes , yet my state is well .
Make the trial of it in any constant question .
Where lies your text ?
What's to do ?
Anything that's mended is but patched .
Why , we shall make him mad indeed .
Shall we not , Sir Andrew ?
Yet there he was , and there I found this credit , That he did range the town to seek me out .
Come , bring us , bring us where he is .
Would thou'dst be ruled by me !
My niece is already in the belief that he's mad .
I care not for good life .
O , if I thought that , I'd beat him like a dog !
Lie thou there ( throwing down a letter ) , for here comes the trout that must be caught with tickling .
I think his soul is in hell , madonna .
Nay , that's certain .
Malvolio's coming down this walk .
I will return again into the house and desire some conduct of the lady .
What will become of this ?
Are you the lady of the house ?
If this were played upon a stage now , I could condemn it as an improbable fiction .
I could not find him at the Elephant .
Alas , I took great pains to study it , and 'tis poetical .
I will make your peace with him if I can .
doth sway my life." Nay , but first , let me see , let me see , let me see .
Nor I neither .
Yes , by Saint Anne , and ginger shall be hot i ' the mouth too .
What's she ?
And you too , sir .
No .
In Orsino's bosom .
They that add , moreover , he's drunk nightly in your company .
How now , my hearts !
If she do , he'll smile and take 't for a great favor .
Good beauties , let me sustain no scorn .
Sebastian was my father ; Such a Sebastian was my brother too , So went he suited to his watery tomb .
Wouldst thou not be glad to have the niggardly rascally sheep-biter come by some notable shame ?
If he may be conveniently delivered , I would he were , for I am now so far in offense with my niece that I can not pursue with any safety this sport to the upshot .
The better for thy friends .
I have been dear to him , lad , some two thousand strong , or so .
They lack retention .
I know not , madam .
What wouldst thou now ?
I saw 't i ' the orchard .
He shall enlarge him .
Can he that deny ?
She is drowned already , sir , with salt water , though I seem to drown her remembrance again with more .
But you , sir , altered that , for some hour before you took me from the breach of the sea was my sister drowned .
The man grows mad .
This is the man .
You are now out of your text .
Good madonna , why mournest thou ?
Besides , she uses me with a more exalted respect than anyone else that follows her .
So do not I .
Let still the woman take An elder than herself .
I dare lay any money 'twill be nothing yet .
Gentlewoman , my lady calls .
Sir Toby , I must be round with you .
He's as tall a man as any 's in Illyria .
And I , most jocund , apt , and willingly , To do you rest , a thousand deaths would die .
An they be not , let them hang themselves in their own straps .
What thinkest thou of his opinion ?
I am sure no man hath any quarrel to me .
If thou darest tempt me further , draw thy sword .
No , I do not know you , nor I am not sent to you by my lady , to bid you come speak with her , nor your name is not Master Cesario , nor this is not my nose neither .
Speak to me .
There is no obstruction in this .
This is open .
To him , Sir Topas .
How do you , Malvolio ?
That face of his I do remember well .
And by all means stir on the youth to an answer .
You , sir ?
He's fortified against any denial .
Wherefore have these gifts a curtain before 'em ?
What years , i ' faith ?
This will so fright them both that they will kill one another by the look , like cockatrices .
Away before me to sweet beds of flowers .
I am a gentleman .
A lady , sir , though it was said she much resembled me , was yet of many accounted beautiful .
Vent my folly ?
By the Lord , madam , you wrong me , and the world shall know it .
A fiend like thee might bear my soul to hell .
But tell me true , are you not mad indeed ?
When my tongue blabs , then let mine eyes not see .
Have you not set mine honor at the stake , And baited it with all the unmuzzled thoughts That tyrannous heart can think ?
Get you all three into the boxtree .
Do but read .
Do not deny .
I am bound to your niece , sir .
Are you full of them ?
Do you know what you say ?
Get you to your lord .
to fool ) Is thy lady within ?
Dismount thy tuck , be yare in thy preparation , for thy assailant is quick , skillful and deadly .
I would not so much as make water but in a sink-a-pace .
How now , Malvolio ?
Save you , gentleman .
I pity you .
I would you were as I would have you be !
Hast thou forgot thyself ?
Farewell .
Ay , but I know , What dost thou know ?
And cross-gartered ?
Jove and my stars be praised !

Come hither , knight .
Who saw Cesario , ho ?
By my troth , the fool has an excellent breast .
To answer by the method , in the first of his heart .
A wreck past hope he was .
By this hand , I am .
I'll help you , Sir Toby , because we'll be dressed together .
Some achieve greatness , " What sayest thou ?
Make that good .
What should I think on 't ?
For his thoughts , Would they were blanks , rather than fill'd with me .
And you , sir .
Then hadst thou had an excellent head of hair .
It did come to his hands , and commands shall be executed .
A contagious breath .
Anything .
Pray God , he keep his oath !
Madam , I will .
I will be strange , stout , in yellow stockings , and cross-gartered , even with the swiftness of putting on .
Excellent !
Orsino , noble sir , Be pleased that I shake off these names you give me .
Come , my young soldier , put up your iron .
em all three all ready .
Madam ?
He did me kindness , sir , drew on my side , But in conclusion put strange speech upon me .
Good Sir Toby !
Come , boy , with me .
But this is from my commission .
Does she so ?
No , not a grize .
Will you hoist sail , sir ?
I prithee , foolish Greek , depart from me .
With drinking healths to my niece .
Have you no wit , manners , nor honesty but to gabble like tinkers at this time of night ?
But it becomes me well enough , does 't not ?
I pray you , sir , what is he ?
Where's my cousin Toby ?
Sir , I have not you by the hand .
Never trust me , then .
Still in this fashion , color , ornament , For him I imitate .
She loves me , sure !
Vent my folly !
Well-a-day that you were , sir .
I can say little more than I have studied , and that question's out of my part .
Who of my people hold him in delay ?
My kind Antonio , I can no other answer make but thanks , And thanks , and ever thanks .
Or I'll deliver thy indignation to him by word of mouth .
I know I can do it .
I have many enemies in Orsino's court , Else would I very shortly see thee there .
I will do so .
He , upon some action , Is now in durance at Malvolio's suit , A gentleman and follower of my lady's .
His life I gave him and did thereto add My love , without retention or restraint , All his in dedication .
Pox on 't !
It is no matter how witty , so it be eloquent and full of invention .
But we will draw the curtain and show you the picture .
For women are as roses , whose fair flower Being once displayed , doth fall that very hour .
Souls and bodies hath he divorced three , and his incensement at this moment is so implacable that satisfaction can be none but by pangs of death and sepulchre .
If it please the eye of one , it is with me as the very true sonnet is , "Please one , and please all." Why , how dost thou , man ?
Fare thee well .
So that by my foes , sir I profit in the knowledge of myself , and by my friends , I am abused .
What's the matter ?
I am all the daughters of my father's house , And all the brothers too , and yet I know not .
And ask no other dowry with her but such another jest .
Why , what's the matter ?
O , you give me ill counsel .
And you , sir .
What , to perverseness ?
Father , I charge thee , by thy reverence , Here to unfold ( though lately we intended To keep in darkness what occasion now Reveals before 'tis ripe ) what thou dost know Hath newly passed between this youth and me .
It shines everywhere .
Then he's a rogue , and a passy-measures pavin .
Come , Sir Andrew , there's no remedy .
Even what it please my lord that shall become him .
Tell him he shall not speak with me .
Cesario is your servant's name , fair princess .
I know thee well .
FOOL Oh , he's drunk , Sir Toby , an hour agone .
Get him to say his prayers , good Sir Toby , get him to pray .
Antonio , I arrest thee at the suit of Count Orsino .
It alone concerns your ear .
Good Mistress Accost , I desire better acquaintance .
Why , then , build me thy fortunes upon the basis of valor .
Good my mouse of virtue , answer me .
Go , hang yourselves all !
No , madam , I do but read madness .
And on that vice in him will my revenge find notable cause to work .
I have not seen such a firago .
I was adored once too .
Let him approach .
Has here writ a letter to you .
Be you his eunuch , and your mute I'll be .
I wish it might , for now I am your fool .
Of what nature the wrongs are thou hast done him , I know not , but thy intercepter , full of despite , bloody as the hunter , attends thee at the orchard end .
His dishonesty appears in leaving his friend here in necessity and denying him .
He is knight , dubbed with unhatched rapier and on carpet consideration , but he is a devil in private brawl .
I have sent after him .
Is 't not well done ?
Sir Toby , madam , your kinsman .
Madam , I will .
And what should I do in Illyria ?
As hell , Sir Topas .
Open 't , and read it .
Fool !
This was looked for at your hand , and this was balked .
He says he'll come .
If that this simple syllogism will serve , so .
More matter for a May morning .
Come , sir , away .
I tell thee true .
I could be sad .
If I lose a scruple of this sport , let me be boiled to death with melancholy .
I know his soul is in heaven , fool .
Give me now leave to leave thee .
Go to , you're a dry fool .
One face , one voice , one habit , and two persons !
Virtue that transgresses is but patched with sin , and sin that amends is but patched with virtue .
You stand amazed , But be of comfort .
I have heard of some kind of men that put quarrels purposely on others , to taste their valor .
If you will see it , follow me .
I am not of your element .
Gentleman , God save thee .
Truly , madam , he holds Beelzebub at the staves ' end as well as a man in his case may do .
How is 't with you ?
Of very ill manner .
Spend this for me .
This shall end without the perdition of souls .
What means this lady ?
No , sir , I live by the church .
So I do , madonna .
Slight , will you make an ass o ' me ?
Fear not , Cesario .
How now ?
You might have saved me my pains to have taken it away yourself .
Good madam , let me see your face .
Ay , but he will not now be pacified .
I am bound to the Count Orsino's court .
Go , write it in a martial hand .
Only myself stood out ; For which , if I be lapsed in this place , I shall pay dear .
Fool , fool , fool , I say !
An 't be any way , it must be with valor , for policy I hate .
But out of question , 'tis Maria's hand .
Oh , if it prove , Tempests are kind and salt waves fresh in love !
Remain thou still in darkness .
I left no ring with her .
Let us therefore eat and drink .
What is his name ?
I know thy constellation is right apt For this affair .
Come , sir , I pray you , go .
I had as lief be a Brownist as a politician .
My servant , sir !
For Monsieur Malvolio , let me alone with him .
One , sir , that for his love dares yet do more Than you have heard him brag to you he will .
Excellent .
Most sweet lady , A comfortable doctrine , and much may be said of it .
But here the lady comes .
Sweet lady , ho , ho .
Did she see thee the while , old boy ?
She made good view of me , indeed so much That sure methought her eyes had lost her tongue , For she did speak in starts distractedly .
There's one at the gate .
What dost thou mean ?
Twill endure wind and weather .
Belike you slew great number of his people ?
In the wars .
Ay , he .
A most extracting frenzy of mine own From my remembrance clearly banished his .
Here comes the man , sir , that did rescue me .
Let me yet know of you whither you are bound .
I would be sorry , sir , but the fool should be as oft with your master as with my mistress : I think I saw your wisdom there .
I never hurt you .
What money , sir ?
I can not love him .
And , to inure thyself to what thou art like to be , cast thy humble slough and appear fresh .
That's a degree to love .
Does he rave ?
Why , what are you ?
He can not by the duello avoid it .
Come , we'll have him in a dark room and bound .
On thy life I charge thee , hold !
And died that day when Viola from her birth Had numbered thirteen years .
He does smile his face into more lines than is in the new map with the augmentation of the Indies .
But oh , how vile an idol proves this god !
I thank you .
Master Malvolio ?
He started one poor heart of mine in thee .
Sad , lady !
By my troth , Sir Toby , you must come in earlier o ' nights .
I have heard her swear 't .
I'll come to him .
I say , there is no darkness but ignorance , in which thou art more puzzled than the Egyptians in their fog .
I am not such an ass , but I can keep my hand dry .
My father had a daughter loved a man As it might be , perhaps , were I a woman , I should your lordship .
I take pleasure in singing , sir .
Yet you will be hanged for being so long absent .
She that would alter services with thee , The Fortunate Unhappy" Daylight and champaign discovers not more .
Notable pirate !
Her husband , sirrah ?
Soft , soft !
My duty , madam , and most humble service .
You are resolute , then ?
If you be not mad , be gone .
It is heresy .
Good Master Fabian , grant me another request .
If this letter move him not , his legs can not .
He left behind him myself and a sister , both born in an hour .
Take away the lady .
Is that the meaning of "accost" ?
Fate , show thy force .
Tell me that .
For this night , to bed , and dream on the event .
He's a coward and a coistrel that will not drink to my niece till his brains turn o ' th ' toe like a parish top .
God send you , sir , a speedy infirmity , for the better increasing your folly !
I must catechise you for it , madonna .
To him in thine own voice , and bring me word how thou findest him .
It hangs like flax on a distaff .
Give me excess of it that , surfeiting , The appetite may sicken , and so die .
Past question , for thou seest it will not curl by nature .
And they have been grand-jurymen since before Noah was a sailor .
Who does beguile you ?
I'll drink to her as long as there is a passage in my throat and drink in Illyria .
What's a drunken man like , fool ?
Shall I play my freedom at tray-trip , and become thy bondslave ?
If Sir Toby would leave drinking , thou wert as witty a piece of Eve's flesh as any in Illyria .
It is too hard a knot for me to untie !
What o ' that ?
Therefore in my presence still smile , dear my sweet , I prithee."
How now !
He'll speak with you , will you or no .
Tut , there's life in 't , man .
Observe his construction of it .
Ay , marry , what is he ?
I will on with my speech in your praise and then show you the heart of my message .
I hate a drunken rogue .
I say to you this house is dark .
It shall advantage thee more than ever the bearing of letter did .
She did commend my yellow stockings of late , she did praise my leg being cross-gartered , and in this she manifests herself to my love , and with a kind of injunction , drives me to these habits of her liking .
I am no fee'd post , lady .
I told him you were sick .
He is , indeed , sir , the most skillful , bloody , and fatal opposite that you could possibly have found in any part of Illyria .
Well held out , i ' faith .
Sir !
No man must know." What follows ?
Nay , but say true , does it work upon him ?
Come , away !
How now ?
Come to what is important in 't .
Sir Topas , Sir Topas !
Thy smiles become thee well .
The honorable lady of the house , which is she ?
Sir , I bade them take away you .
I do I know not what and fear to find Mine eye too great a flatterer for my mind .
What kind of woman is't ?
If you desire the spleen , and will laugh yourself into stitches , follow me .
Farewell .
Of what personage and years is he ?
Gracious Olivia , What do you say , Cesario ? , Good my lord , My lord would speak .
Once more , Cesario , Get thee to yond same sovereign cruelty .
Fear'st thou that , Antonio ?
He speaks nothing but madman .
I'll be your purse-bearer and leave you For an hour .
A stoup of wine !
Art thou mad ?
Approach , Sir Andrew .
To one of your receiving Enough is shown .
Nothing that can be can come between me and the full prospect of my hopes .
You can fool no more money out of me at this throw .
You lie .
But in my conscience , sir , I do not care for you .
How now , Malvolio !
Cesario , you do not keep promise with me .
He hath not told us of the captain yet .
Of your complexion .
You may have very fit occasion for 't .
Do it quickly .
Sweet Sir Andrew !
Look you , sir , such a one I was this present .
He has been yonder i ' the sun practising behavior to his own shadow this half hour .
Wilt thou go to bed , Malvolio ?
What say you sir ?
Tell me why .
I shall answer for her .
Fare you well at once .
Taurus !
We shall have a rare letter from him : but you'll not deliver 't ?
Twas never merry world Since lowly feigning was call'd compliment .
He's coming , madam ; but in very strange manner .
Whence came you , sir ?
He hath known you but three days , and already you are no stranger .
Your ladyship were best to have some guard about you if he come , for sure the man is tainted in 's wits .
None can be called deformed but the unkind .
This concurs directly with the letter .
And so they are .
On a moderate pace I have since arrived but hither .
But if he had not been in drink , he would have tickled you othergates than he did .
That defense thou hast , betake thee to 't .
I'll follow this good man , and go with you ; And , having sworn truth , ever will be true .
I will meditate the while upon some horrid message for a challenge .
That you do think you are not what you are .
No , sooth , sir .
Very sweet and contagious , i ' faith .
Accost , Sir Andrew , accost .
Come , throw it o'er my face .
Marian , I say !
There is no way but this , Sir Andrew .
Hold little faith , though thou hast too much fear .
Art not thou the Lady Olivia's fool ?
If you will not murder me for my love , let me be your servant .
Marry , sir , lullaby to your bounty till I come again .
He's in yellow stockings .
The knave counterfeits well .
The more fool , madonna , to mourn for your brother's soul being in heaven .
Now , as thou lovest me , let me see his letter .
Fool , I say !
Yes , being kept together and put to use .
Must she not then be answered ?
Nay , pursue him now , lest the device take air and taint .
He is sad and civil And suits well for a servant with my fortunes .
Troth , sir , I can yield you none without words , and words are grown so false , I am loath to prove reason with them .
Let all the rest give place .
Fabian can scarce hold him yonder .
Who was it ?
Good fool , for my brother's death .
Let me see the caper .
I would therefore my sister had no name , sir .
Fie , that you'll say so !
There's another .
A little , by your favor .
But as well ?
Good Maria , let this fellow be looked to .
You mistake , sir .
Go call him hither .
Hang him , foul collier !
O good Sir Toby , hold !
No , sir , the worse .
Oh , you are sick of self-love , Malvolio , and taste with a distempered appetite .
What a caterwauling do you keep here !
Who hath made this havoc with them ?
To be Count Malvolio !
Tis not for gravity to play at cherry-pit with Satan .
Methinks his words do from such passion fly , That he believes himself .
In what chapter of his bosom ?
And for his cowardship , ask Fabian .
Put them to motion .
What , Curio ?
Fair lady , do you think you have fools in hand ?
You , uncivil lady , To whose ingrate and unauspicious altars My soul the faithfull'st off'rings have breathed out That e'er devotion tendered , what shall I do ?
I'll do my best To woo your lady , Whoe'er I woo , myself would be his wife .
Sweet Sir Toby , be patient for tonight .
Why , he has three thousand ducats a year .
A spirit I am indeed , But am in that dimension grossly clad Which from the womb I did participate .
Oh , that I served that lady And might not be delivered to the world , Till I had made mine own occasion mellow , What my estate is .
I had rather than forty pound I were at home .
I could marry this wench for this device .
Go .
And when she went away now , "Let this fellow be looked to." "Fellow ! " Not "Malvolio , " nor after my degree , but "fellow." Why , everything adheres together , that no dram of a scruple , no scruple of a scruple , no obstacle , no incredulous or unsafe circumstance , what can be said ?
Tell me your mind .
I have 't in my nose too .
Some are born great , some achieve greatness , and some have greatness thrust upon 'em .
A gentleman .
I say , this house is as dark as ignorance , though ignorance were as dark as hell .
Madam , yond young fellow swears he will speak with you .
Alas , their love may be called appetite , No motion of the liver , but the palate , That suffer surfeit , cloyment , and revolt ; But mine is all as hungry as the sea , And can digest as much .
Who , Sir Andrew Aguecheek ?
I'll have an action of battery against him if there be any law in Illyria .
I hate it as an unfilled can .
Still so cruel ?
He left this ring behind him , Would I or not .
I'll write thee a challenge .
A noble duke , in nature As in name .
I will acquit you .
And your horse now would make him an ass .
Let the garden door be shut , and leave me to my hearing .
Thou mightst have done this without thy beard and gown .
I'll serve this duke .
I did think , by the excellent constitution of thy leg , it was formed under the star of a galliard .
I know my physic will work with him .
I will help you to 't .
Nay , let him alone .
And what's her history ?
That's all one : has hurt me , and there's the end on 't .
Here lies your way .
I will not give my part of this sport for a pension of thousands to be paid from the Sophy .
I saw him put down the other day with an ordinary fool that
I sent for thee upon a sad occasion .
Not to be abed after midnight is to be up betimes , and Nay , my troth , I know not .
I can tell thee where that saying was born , of "I fear no colors." Where , good Mistress Mary ?
Write loyal cantons of contemned love And sing them loud even in the dead of night .
The madly used Malvolio." Did he write this ?
But if she can not love you , sir ?
I pray you , keep it in .
This is Illyria , lady .
Most certain , if you are she , you do usurp yourself , for what is yours to bestow is not yours to reserve .
Now let's have a catch .
Ay me , detested !
Good .
But , come what may , I do adore thee so That danger shall seem sport , and I will go .
My remembrance is very free and clear from any image of offense done to any man .
I can hardly forbear hurling things at him .
Come by and by to my chamber .
What is to be said to him , lady ?
Let me speak a little .
I prithee now , ungird thy strangeness and tell me what I shall vent to my lady .
Believe me , I am not .
Well , come again tomorrow .
We took him for a coward , but he's the very devil incardinate .
There is no woman's sides Can bide the beating of so strong a passion As love doth give my heart .
Stay , I prithee , tell me what thou thinkest of me .
If not , an it would please you to take leave of her , she is very willing to bid you farewell .
My most exquisite Sir Topas !
By your patience , no .
If thou hast her not i ' the end , call me "Cut." If I do not , never trust me , take it how you will .
I will give out divers schedules of my beauty .
Be not afraid of greatness." 'T was well writ .
No , indeed , sir ; the Lady Olivia has no folly .
Do you come near me now ?
Put up your sword .
This savors not much of distraction .
I will be proud , I will read politic authors , I will baffle Sir Toby , I will wash off gross acquaintance , I will be point- devise the very man .
Bonos dies , Sir Toby .
Sir Toby Belch !
I am as mad as he , If sad and merry madness equal be .
Tis with him in standing water , between boy and man .
Like a drowned man , a fool and a madman .
A good knave .
Yet I suppose him virtuous , know him noble , Of great estate , of fresh and stainless youth .
So thou mayst say the king lies by a beggar if a beggar dwell near him , or the church stands by thy tabor , if thy tabor stand by the church .
Where goes Cesario ?
My name is Mary , sir .
What is the opinion of Pythagoras concerning wildfowl ?
Fortune forbid my outside have not charmed her !
But , if you were the devil , you are fair .
Marry , sir , they praise me and make an ass of me , now my foes tell me plainly I am an ass .
Or o ' mine either ?
This is as uncivil as strange .
Nay , I prithee , put on this gown and this beard .
I thank my stars I am happy .
Is it a world to hide virtues in ?
And so adieu , good madam .
He will bear you easily and reins well .
But that it would be double-dealing , sir , I would you could make it another .
The lady of the Strachy married the yeoman of the wardrobe .
My prayers , minx ?
Twere as good a deed as to drink when a man's a-hungry , to challenge him the field and then to break promise with him and make a fool of him .
Nay , let me alone for swearing .
Orsino , this is that Antonio That took the And this is he that did the When your young nephew Titus lost his leg .
You know , he brought me out o ' favor with my lady about a bear-baiting here .
My lady is within , sir .
He is now in some commerce with my lady and will by and by depart .
No pains , sir .
He takes on him to understand so much , and therefore comes to speak with you .
Faith , I'll home tomorrow , Sir Toby .
Were we not born under Taurus ?
In his bosom ?
Will you help ? , An ass-head , and a coxcomb , and a knave , a thin-faced knave , a gull !
You might do much .
His counsel now might do me golden service .
You should then have accosted her , and with some excellent jests , fire-new from the mint , you should have banged the youth into dumbness .
Have you no more to say ?
My life upon 't , young though thou art , thine eye Hath stay'd upon some favor that it loves .
A very dishonest paltry boy , and more a coward than a hare .
A dry jest , sir .
An apple , cleft in two , is not more twin Than these two creatures .
Run after that same peevish messenger , The county's man .
I warrant thou art a merry fellow and carest for nothing .
Let's to bed , knight .
He seems to have a foreknowledge of that too , and therefore comes to speak with you .
If all the devils of hell be drawn in little , and Legion himself possessed him , yet I'll speak to him .
I'll make one too .
What is your name ?
I think you set nothing by a bloody coxcomb .
If a bloody coxcomb be a hurt , you have hurt me .
If you can separate yourself and your misdemeanors , you are welcome to the house .
I defy lechery .
And so had mine .
Most excellent accomplished lady , the heavens rain odors on you !
Thou shalt not be the worse for me : there's gold .
M.O.A.I." This simulation is not as the former , and yet to crush this a little , it would bow to me , for every one of these letters are in my name .
Give me .
Dexterously , good madonna .
Now Mercury endue thee with leasing , for thou speakest well of fools !
Ha ?
What country , friends , is this ?
No , sir , no jot .
If one should be a prey , how much the better To fall before the lion than the wolf !
He's a very fool and a prodigal .
Oh , say so , and so be !
Slid , I'll after him again and beat him .
O , my poor brother !
Say that some lady , as perhaps there is , Hath for your love a great a pang of heart As you have for Olivia .
Sneck up !
I leave my duty a little unthought of and speak out of my injury .
I shall be constrained in 't to call thee knave , knight .
I call thee by the most modest terms , for I am one of those gentle ones that will use the devil himself with courtesy .
Remember who commended thy yellow stockings , " Thy yellow stockings ?
But yet I can not love him ; He might have took his answer long ago .
Doth he not mend ?
Give me my veil .
His eyes were set at eight i ' the morning .
An you love me , let's do 't .
I prithee , be gone .
But I perceive in you so excellent a touch of modesty that you will not extort from me what I am willing to keep in .
Most radiant , exquisite and unmatchable beauty , I pray you , tell me if this be the lady of the house , for I never saw her .
Most villanously , like a pedant that keeps a school i ' the church .
That the soul of our grandam might haply inhabit a bird .
Back you shall not to the house , unless you undertake that with me which with as much safety you might answer him .
He has heard that word of some great man and now applies it to a fool .
And yet , by the very fangs of malice I swear , I am not that I play .
If one knight give a , Would you have a love song or a song of good life ?
No , my lord , not I. Alas , it is the baseness of thy fear That makes thee strangle thy propriety .
Dear lad , believe it .
Since the youth of the count's was today with thy lady , she is much out of quiet .
O good Antonio , forgive me your trouble .
Nay , then I must have an ounce or two of this malapert blood from you .
It hath no tongue to vex you .
Farewell , fair cruelty .
What gentleman ?
Hurt him in eleven places .
Go off , I discard you .
Nay , good Sir Toby .
I'll go another way to work with him .
The count himself here hard by woos her .
Ay , ay .
Out of my sight ! , Be not offended , dear Cesario. , Rudesby , be gone !
By my troth , thou hast an open hand .
I think nobly of the soul , and no way approve his opinion .
Husband ?
Sir Toby will be sworn that I am no fox , but he will not pass his word for two pence that you are no fool .
True , madam .
Why , this is evident to any formal capacity .
An you part so , mistress , I would I might never draw sword again .
Here comes my noble gull-catcher .
Away !
But I know to be up late is to be up late .
He has broke my head across and has given Sir Toby a bloody coxcomb too .
Here comes the count .
What meanest thou by that , Malvolio ?
For the love of God , a surgeon !
O Lord !
Let me be clear of thee .
I'll no more of you .
I think not so , my lord .
There's money for thee .
What is the matter with thee ?
Wherefore , sweetheart ?
Farewell .
Fare you well .
Dear lady , Give me leave , beseech you .
Nay , come , I prithee .
The captain that did bring me first on shore Hath my maid's garments .
If thou entertainest my love , let it appear in thy smiling .
I can not be so answer'd .
The gentleness of all the gods go with thee !
Hob , nob , is his word .
I go , sir , but I would not have you to think that my desire of having is the sin of covetousness .
My determinate voyage is mere extravagancy .
Thou shalt hold the opinion of Pythagoras ere I will allow of thy wits , and fear to kill a woodcock lest thou dispossess the soul of thy grandam .
I do not now fool myself , to let imagination jade me , for every reason excites to this , that my lady loves me .
If the heavens had been pleased , would we had so ended !
So , let me hear you speak .
I forgive you the praise .
I say , remember .
To anger him , we'll have the bear again , and we will fool him black and blue .
Not black in my mind , though yellow in my legs .
I think we do know the sweet Roman hand .
Will you go hunt , my lord ?
Dost thou live by thy tabour ?
What I am and what I would are as secret as maidenhead .
Then let thy love be younger than thyself , Or thy affection can not hold the bent .
What's that ?
So could I too .
How have you made division of yourself ?
Shall we do that ?
Will you walk towards him ?
Lechery !
O , sir , I will not be so hard-hearted .
Do not then walk too open .
How with mine honor may I give him that Which I have given to you ?
Therefore get you on and give him his desire .
No , my profound heart .
Nothing but this : your true love for my master .
Marry , and it shall be done tomorrow morning if I live .
Pardon me , sweet one , even for the vows We made each other but so late ago .
Belike this is a man of that quirk .
Save thee , friend , and thy music .
Who governs here ?
But to read his right wits is to read thus .
For but a month ago I went from hence , And then 'twas fresh in murmur , as , you know , What great ones do the less will prattle of , That he did seek the love of fair Olivia .
What shall you ask of me that I'll deny , That honor , saved , may upon asking give ?
I have heard my father name him .
Nay , I'll ne'er believe a madman till I see his brains .
I can not love him .
Too well what love women to men may owe .
Alas , Malvolio , this is not my writing , Though , I confess , much like the character .
Sayest thou that house is dark ?
How can this be ?
I'll not meddle with him .
I did send , After the last enchantment you did here , A ring in chase of you .
Though you have put me into darkness and given your drunken cousin rule over me , yet have I the benefit of my senses as well as your Ladyship .
Ay , my lord , this same .
Come on , to 't .
Alas , that they are so , To die even when they to perfection grow !
Good madonna , give me leave to prove you a fool .
Here comes the Countess .
It might have since been answered in repaying What we took from them , which , for traffic's sake , Most of our city did .
But , as you say , sir , let your bounty take a nap , I will awake it anon .
A baubling vessel was he captain of , For shallow draught and bulk unprizable , With which such scathful grapple did he make With the most noble bottom of our fleet , That very envy and the tongue of loss Cried fame and honor on him. , What's the matter ?
Ass , I doubt not .
I mean , to go , sir , to enter .
I had a pass with him , rapier , scabbard , and all , and he gives me the stuck-in with such a mortal motion , that it is inevitable .
You'll find it otherwise , I assure you .
Good .
How vexest thou this man !
O knight , thou lackest a cup of canary .
Have I , Malvolio ?
Who does do you wrong ?
This was a great argument of love in her toward you .
An we do not , it is pity of our lives .
Refuse it not .
I am no more mad than you are .
Why , man , he's a very devil .
As I am a gentleman , I will live to be thankful to thee for 't .
I'll make division of my present with you .
Methinks sometimes I have no more wit than a Christian or an ordinary man has .
I will be free from thee .
His indignation derives itself out of a very competent injury .
Oh , I have read it .
Here comes my lady .
It is the more like to be feigned .
Were not you even now with the Countess Olivia ?
M" , why , that begins my name .
I could not stay behind you .
Give them way till he take leave , and presently after him .
Ay , good fool .
Good night , Penthesilea .
I should have given 't you today morning , but as a madman's epistles are no gospels , so it skills not much when they are delivered .
If I do not usurp myself , I am .
Yet , when I saw it last , it was besmeared As black as Vulcan in the smoke of war .
Nay , I am for all waters .
Away with him .
Take away the fool , gentlemen .
Let her hang me .
How will this fadge ?
You have said , sir .
My niece shall take note of it , and assure thyself , there is no love-broker in the world can more prevail in man's commendation with woman than report of valor .
One draught above heat makes him a fool , the second mads him , and a third drowns him .
I am the man .
Is it so long ? , Call forth the holy father .
Thou know'st not me .
I thank you for your pains .
Why , sir , her name's a word , and to dally with that word might make my sister wanton .
I'll stay a month longer .
Ourselves we do not owe .
Here comes Sir Toby halting .
Here he is , here he is .
What is he at the gate , cousin ?
Shall I vent to her that thou art coming ?
Do 't , knight .
He shall see none to fear .
A love song , a love song .
No way but gentleness , gently , gently .
Cesario , come , For so you shall be , while you are a man .
What a plague means my niece , to take the death of her brother thus ?
For the love of God , your help !
I'll give 't him .
Thou'rt i ' the right .
Come thy ways , Signior Fabian .
I will construe to them whence you come .
Is there no respect of place , persons , nor time in you ?
Oh , ho !
Give me some music .
I hate ingratitude more in a man Than lying , vainness , babbling , drunkenness , Or any taint of vice whose strong corruption Inhabits our frail blood , O heavens themselves !
My lady has a white hand , and the Myrmidons are no bottle-ale houses .
He knows I know him well .
See him delivered , Fabian ; bring him hither .
At your request !
It is something of my negligence , nothing of my purpose .
Besides , you grow dishonest .
Give me faith , say I .
My matter hath no voice , lady , but to your own most pregnant and vouchsafed ear .
Give me thy hand , And let me see thee in thy woman's weeds .
Never in your life , I think , unless you see canary put me down .
Are they like to take dust , like Mistress Mall's picture ?
Smilest thou ?
Most wonderful !
Give us the place alone .
How is't with you , sir ?
I am afraid this great lubber , the world , will prove a cockney .
And now I do bethink me , it was she First told me thou wast mad , then camest in smiling , And in such forms which here were presupposed Upon thee in the letter .
Make him believe thou art Sir Topas the curate .
Hold , sir , or I'll throw your dagger o'er the house .
Excellent good , i ' faith .
Think of me as you please .
In faith , they are as true of heart as we .
In voices well divulged , free , learned , and valiant ; And in dimension and the shape of nature A gracious person .
And yet complainest thou of obstruction ?
Do you not hear , fellows ?
Unless the master were the man .
Tell her my love , more noble than the world , Prizes not quantity of dirty lands ; The parts that fortune hath bestowed upon her , Tell her , I hold as giddily as fortune ; But 'tis that miracle and queen of gems That nature pranks her in attracts my soul .
Marry , will I , sir .
Hold , Toby !
Yes , and shall do till the pangs of death shake him .
I frown the while , and perchance wind up watch , or play with my , some rich jewel .
There is a fair behavior in thee , captain , And though that nature with a beauteous wall Doth oft close in pollution , yet of thee I will believe thou hast a mind that suits With this thy fair and outward character .
Why , man ?
Some are born great , "
You shall know more hereafter .
He shall think , by the letters that thou wilt drop , that they come from my niece , and that she's in love with him .
I'll make the motion .
I'll none of it .
Oh , it came o'er my ear like the sweet sound , That breathes upon a bank of violets , Stealing and giving odor .
Here comes the little villain .
Ay , 'tis strong , and it does indifferent well in a dun-colored stock .
How now , my metal of India ?
If that be to care for nothing , sir , I would it would make you invisible .
I'll pay thy pleasure then .
Prithee , be content .
Good , i ' faith .
What would my lord , but that he may not have , Wherein Olivia may seem serviceable ?
An I do not , Come , let's see the event .
Oh , 'twill be admirable !
Scout me for him at the corner the orchard like a bum-baily .
Will either of you bear me a challenge to him ?
He hath been most notoriously abused .
Come , sir , you peevishly threw it to her , and her will is it should be so returned .
No , sir , it is legs and thighs .
Art thou good at these kickshawses , knight ?
A mellifluous voice , as I am true knight .
So that , conclusions to be as kisses , if your four negatives make your two affirmatives , why then the worse for my friends and the better for my foes .
He is as horribly conceited of him , and pants and looks pale , as if a bear were at his heels .
Well , I will be so much a sinner , to be a double-dealer .
Let thy blood and spirit embrace them .
He finished indeed his mortal act That day that made my sister thirteen years .
I protest I take these wise men that crow so at these set kind of fools no better than the fools ' zanies .
Speak your office .
He is not here , so please your lordship , that should sing it .
The fiend is rough and will not be roughly used .
Seven of my people , with an obedient start , make out for him .
Orsino .
Sport royal , I warrant you .
Why , what would you ?
The cunning of her passion Invites me in this churlish messenger .
He is about the house .
These wise men that give fools money get themselves a good report , after fourteen years ' purchase .
Here he comes with your niece .
I bring no overture of war , no taxation of homage .
My words are as full of peace as matter .
Be that thou know'st thou art , and then thou art As great as that thou fear'st .
Come , sir , I will not let you go .
I am very comptible , even to the least sinister usage .
Aha !
I beseech you , what manner of man is he ?
It begins "Hold thy peace." I shall never begin if I hold my peace .
How say you to that , Malvolio ?
Andrew Aguecheek"
Peace , you rogue , no more o ' that .
How quickly the wrong side may be turned outward !
I have no exquisite reason for 't , but I have reason good enough .
Shall we go see the relics of this town ?
I thank thee .
Is this the madman ?
I will plant you two , and let the fool make a third , where he shall find the letter .
My lord , I do protest , O , do not swear !
Well , sir , for want of other idleness , I'll bide your proof .
There's something in 't That is deceivable .
What wilt thou do ?
Belong you to the Lady Olivia , friends ?
He sees thee not .
Why do you speak to me ?
Thou hadst need send for more money .
Lead me on .
Come hither , Fabian .
I shall be much bound to you for 't .
Go to , thou art made , if thou desirest to be so , " Am I made ?
Before me , she's a good wench .
But what's your jest ?
Which is Sebastian ?
I know my lady will strike him .
Will it be ever thus ?
Come on .
Fool , I'll requite it in the highest degree .
Out o ' tune , sir .
She did show favor to the youth in your sight only to exasperate you , to awake your dormouse valor , to put fire in your heart and brimstone in your liver .
I'll confine myself no finer than I am .
Therefore this letter , being so excellently ignorant , will breed no terror in the youth .
I would not have him miscarry for the half of my dowry .
You are idle , shallow things .
Lips , do not move ; No man must know."
In my stars I am above thee , but be not afraid of greatness .
Well , go thy way .
Sir , shall I to this lady ?
I would exult , man .
Or do you but counterfeit ?
Madman , thou errest .
Be clamorous , and leap all civil bounds , Rather than make unprofited return .
For they shall yet belie thy happy years That say thou art a man .
I delight in masques and revels sometimes altogether .
This does make some obstruction in the blood , this cross-gartering , but what of that ?
Were you a woman , as the rest goes even , I should my tears let fall upon your cheek And say "Thrice-welcome , drowned Viola ! " My father had a mole upon his brow .
We did keep time , sir , in our catches .
From the Count Orsino , is it ?
She took the ring of me .
I am not mad , Sir Topas .
I know your favor well , Though now you have no sea-cap on your head. , Take him away .
And I beseech you come again tomorrow .
Let our catch be "Thou Knave." "Hold thy peace , thou knave , " knight ?
Let some of my people have a special care of him .
You must needs yield your reason , Sir Andrew .
What manner of man ?
You have not seen such a thing as 'tis .
Not too fast !
My lady would not lose him for more than I'll say .
Are you ready , sir ?
Madam !
Good fool , some ink , paper , and light , and convey what I will set down to my lady .
I beseech you , do me this courteous office , as to know of the knight what my offense to him is .
How have the hours racked and tortured me Since I have lost thee !
Is 't possible ?
An thou let part so , Sir Andrew , would thou mightst never draw sword again .
Your lord does know my mind .
Why , would that have mended my hair ?
If it be a suit from the count , I am sick , or not at home .
I ' faith , or I either ?
Hath it not , boy ?
He was a bachelor then .
Let me enjoy my private .
Who has done this , Sir Andrew ?
By my troth , sir , no , though it please you to be one of my friends .
O , by your leave , I pray you , I bade you never speak again of him .
He will find it comes from a clodpole .
Thou shall present me as an eunuch to him .
The triplex , sir , is a good tripping measure , or the bells of Saint Bennet , sir , may put you in mind , one , two , three .
Why , "some are born great , some achieve greatness , and some have greatness thrown upon them." I was one , sir , in this interlude , one Sir Topas , sir , but that's all one .
Why , I think so .
These clothes are good enough to drink in , and so be these boots too .
I think it well , my lord .
Come , begin .
How does he love me ?
No man must know." If this should be thee , Malvolio ?
So full of shapes is fancy That it alone is high fantastical .
No woman's heart So big , to hold so much .
Good fool , as ever thou wilt deserve well at my hand , help me to a candle , and pen , ink , and paper .
How can that be ?
Was not this love indeed ?
Well , Jove , not I , is the doer of this , and he is to be thanked .
A gentleman ?
Hold , there's expenses for thee .
I may command where I adore , But silence , like a Lucrece knife , With bloodless stroke my heart doth gore ; M.O.A.I .
Yes , nightingales answer daws !
Sebastian are you ?
Very brief , and to exceeding good sense , less .
Make no compare Between that love a woman can bear me And that I owe Olivia .
Orsino .
Madam , you have done me wrong , Notorious wrong .
Go off .
My duty hushes me .
Marry , now I let go your hand , I am barren .
Look then to be well edified when the fool delivers the madman .
Why , let her except , before excepted .
Primo , secundo , tertio is a good play , and the old saying is , the third pays for all .
But he has promised me , as he is a gentleman and a soldier , he will not hurt you .
Infirmity , that decays the wise , doth ever make the better fool .
Oh , that record is lively in my soul !
For the love o ' God , peace !
If you will let your lady know I am here to speak with her , and bring her along with you , it may awake my bounty further .
I will fetch you light , and paper , and ink .
Alas the day !
Well , let it be. , What ho , Malvolio !
Soft , here follows prose .
How now , Sir Toby Belch !
She is not worth thee , then .
Still so constant , lord .
Ay , husband .
Whither , my lord ? , Cesario , husband , stay .
Thou'rt a scholar .
Plague on 't , an I thought he had been valiant and so cunning in fence , I'd have seen him damned ere I'd have challenged him .
Send one presently to Sir Toby .
Why , thou hast put him in such a dream that when the image of it leaves him he must run mad .
But , sir , I will deliver his challenge by word of mouth , set upon Aguecheek a notable report of valor , and drive the gentleman ( as I know his youth will aptly receive it ) into a most hideous opinion of his rage , skill , fury , and impetuosity .
Tis a fair young man , and well attended .
Still you keep o ' the windy side of the law .
And for that I promised you , I'll be as good as my word .
Know'st thou this country ?
I know not what 'twas but distraction .
Tis my picture .
Where's Antonio , then ?
But died thy sister of her love , my boy ?
O time , thou must untangle this , not I .
For youth is bought more oft than begged or borrow'd .
Cast thy humble slough , " says she .
I prithee , and I'll pay thee bounteously , Conceal me what I am , and be my aid For such disguise as haply shall become The form of my intent .
She returns this ring to you , sir .
Stand here , make a good show on 't .
My brother he is in Elysium .
He is sure possessed , madam .
I speak too loud. , Where's Malvolio ?
Jove bless thee , master Parson .
Too old by heaven .
I have limed her , but it is Jove's doing , and Jove make me thankful !
Make me a willow cabin at your gate And call upon my soul within the house .
Od's lifelings , here he is ! , You broke my head for nothing , and that that I did , I was set on to do 't by Sir Toby .
Therefore perpend , my princess , and give ear .
What would you ?
Haply your eye shall light upon some toy You have desire to purchase , and your store , I think , is not for idle markets , sir .
Wilt thou set thy foot o ' my neck ?
Antonio , O my dear Antonio !
That's sides and heart .
To bed ?
Truly , sir , the better for my foes and the worse for my friends .
No , faith , I'll not stay a jot longer .
If he can not , let the botcher mend him .
My lady bade me tell you , that , though she harbors you as her kinsman , she's nothing allied to your disorders .
Nothing that is so is so .
Now heaven walks on earth .
Beshrew his soul for me !
Taste your legs , sir .
That most ingrateful boy there by your side From the rude sea's enraged and foamy mouth Did I redeem .
Yet you began rudely .
Receive it so .
Thy reason , dear venom , give thy reason .
My gentleman , Cesario ?
Call in my gentlewoman .
Madam , I am most apt to embrace your offer .
No , madam , he does nothing but smile .
Thou dost speak masterly .
Why , it hath bay windows transparent as barricadoes , and the clerestories toward the south-north are as lustrous as ebony .
I do remember .
Fool !
Keep your purse .
Good fool , help me to some light and some paper .
Go , Sir Andrew .
I'll call Sir Toby the whilst .
Though I struck him first , yet it's no matter for that .
Hold , there's half my coffer .
If I could make that resemble something in me , Softly !
Now Jove , in his next commodity of hair , send thee a beard !
Let him let the matter slip , and I'll give him my horse , gray Capilet .
If this young gentleman Have done offence , I take the fault on me .
Why dost thou not go to church in a galliard and come home in a coranto ?
Marry , I saw your niece do more favors to the Count's servingman than ever she bestowed upon me .
This fellow is wise enough to play the fool , And to do that well craves a kind of wit .
By my troth , I would not undertake her in this company .
This is a practise As full of labor as a wise man's art , For folly that he wisely shows is fit .
Prove true , imagination , oh , prove true , That I , dear brother , be now ta'en for you !
