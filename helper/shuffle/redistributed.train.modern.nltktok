It's another Hero !
Listen to me , because I'm older than you , surely .
Their sweet smells come from those little freckles .
Get out of here quickly !
Revenge .
Oh , she shows the torches how to burn bright !
Women are sex machines below the waist , though they're chaste up above .
As I vowed , I will unite the York and Lancaster families .
Dearest Olivia , What do you have to say for yourself , Cesario ? , My lord , please , My lord wants to speak .
Where are you taking me ?
Or ask you to leave the room ?
I regret all the boring time I wasted with her .
An era of universal peace is about to start .
Yes , as you and the rest will find out as soon as he's home .
She didn't ask anything ?
And I've built two chapels where solemn priests sing continually for Richard's soul .
And should everyone who makes promises and breaks them be hanged ?
Listen to me , Queen .
Not long ago you challenged and opposed your brother , and it is only very recently that he has forgiven you .
Come here , captain .
Give me your hand , and explain your situation to me .
Let's go , then !
Good-bye , my lord .
Call me the worst liar ?
I have to go to England , don't you know that ?
He is my dear friend , your Majesty .
Then hear me , gracious sovereign , and all you peers who owe your lives and duty to this imperial throne .
What did Northumberland say about Richmond ?
What are you going to do ?
Calphurnia cried out three times in her sleep , "Help , someone !
No , you'd answer , "The slaves are ours." And that's just how I'm answering you .
Oh , my lord , my lord , forgive my panic !
Dear sister , it's unfair to me , and unfair to yourself , to turn me into a slave .
Leave me .
Oh , chest , obey me !
Here's another jacket to say thanks .
Madam , madam , Antony's dead !
Ask him to go in .
We You won't pay for the glasses you smashed ?
I'll trust my determination and my hands , but none of Caesar's men .
I am a man again .
Is there anything offensive in it ?
No , my dear , you were a little angel who kept me going .
Answer me .
Shame on you !
This story breaks my heart .
Thanks for that .
A good laugh .
We'll outwit them all , that old geezer , Gremio ; the suspicious father , Minola ; the prim musician lover , Litio , all for the sake of my master , Lucentio .
I'll run from this woman who claims to be my wife as fast as I'd run from a bear .
Your daughter and son-in-law .
I hope you're an expert in your field .
Sit down , Jessica .
I haven't spoken to him since I sent him away from the marketplace earlier .
If we take away Caesar's support , he'll have to come back down to earth ; otherwise , he'll fly too high and keep the rest of us in a state of fear and obedience .
Good-bye , my lord .
I know , prince .
Sister , let's eat and stop worrying .
How amazing !
Here is the count of the slaughtered French .
Then you would have to go beyond heaven , beyond earth .
It seems to me like we're still sleeping , still dreaming .
Hurry up , hurry up .
Besides , I don't like you .
I think he really is angry .
Yes , Petruchio .
And as long as she's herself , wise , beautiful , and faithful , she'll always have a place in my heart .
Here comes Ensign Pistol and his wife .
And he's friendly with Caesar .
Please tell me .
You and I can not be held within the confines of a country's arbitrary customs , dear Kate .
The person who suffers alone suffers the most .
No ?
May the tongues of our critics rot !
Then Desdemona and Othello will go back to Venice .
Be quiet and listen to me .
Justice , find the girl !
I was never a thief or a pirate , though I admit I was your enemy for good reasons .
If it takes all the wine in my bottle , I'll cure him .
You can ride him easily , and he responds well when you pull the reins .
And lovers ' hours are a hundred and sixty times longer than normal ones !
Our enemies have driven us to the edge of the grave .
Which one is Sebastian ?
Saints don't move , even when they grant prayers .
Then surrender , coward , and we'll put you in a freakshow , just like they do with deformed animals .
While we're walking , you can tell me how I ended up sleeping on the ground with these humans last night .
If he's been spending his leisure time in lustful pursuits , then he'll be punished with venereal diseases , and that's his business .
The cure for confusion is not yelling and screaming .
Where's my notebook ? , It's a good idea for me to write down that one can smile and smile , and be a villain .
I'll ask him for my position back again , and he'll tell me I'm a drunk .
You've offered an excellent interpretation .
Don't be offended .
So you're around Lady Luck's waist ?
It has the mark of
It's a bet .
Do you hear what I say , lady ?
I've hired five hundred almsmen to hold up their withered hands to heaven , praying for my pardon twice a day throughout the year .
Yes , better than you know me .
Shall we go send them food and fresh clothing and feed their starving horses before we fight them ?
Go back with her ?
I'm neither , my lord .
There are only friends here .
He struck me from under your arm .
I'll have them sleep on cushions in my tent .
What do you think I've got on my head ?
You love me in spite of your heart , I think .
What do you say to a piece of beef with mustard ?
Help !
Can you tell me if a man named Launcelot , who lives with him , is still there ?
I must go report what happened .
I know that , sir .
What prisoners of rank have been taken , uncle ?
If I agree to this , we may leave unharmed , with our shields undented .
Just as I told you , he usually sleeps in the afternoon .
He won't get the better of me .
Do it immediately , or all your previous services to me were accidental , without purpose .
That'll happen soon enough .
Yes , I'm sure he's dead .
The noble Brutus told you that Caesar was ambitious .
Yes , if your memories do you no good .
Okay , but when ?
What ?
No , vain illusion , so intricately bound up with a king's rest .
And what an excellent piece of work it is , too , madam lady !
Leave me alone now , Iago .
You don't know my voice ?
Rust inside my body and let me die .
Right on cue .
What , did you cheat on us before we deserved it ?
If you want to pick a fight , you'll have to find a more substantial excuse .
I think he'll carry this island home in his pocket and give it to his son like an apple .
A boy robbed you , but you'll beat up the post instead .
It said , "Love me and don't leave me." How can you talk about the quality of the poem or the value of the ring ?
She did compliment me on my yellow stockings recently , and she said she liked how the crisscross laces looked on my legs .
I will settle this matter .
I'm game .
Let's follow the music as far as we can without leaving our station and see if it stops .
If you can leave your body so easily , then the touch of death is like a lover's pinch , which hurts but is desired .
But Roderigo , if you're as courageous and determined as I think you are , then wait just a bit longer .
Risk everything for lead ?
That's not holy , it's heresy .
Heart , for once be stronger than all the rest of the body combined .
That means it's more likely to be fake .
Who would choose to grunt and sweat through an exhausting life , unless they were afraid of something dreadful after death , the undiscovered country from which no visitor returns , which we wonder about without getting any answers from and which makes us stick to the evils we know rather than rush off to seek the ones we don't ?
Our arms , which can be strong and cruel , and our hearts , filled with brotherly love , embrace you with kind love , good thoughts , and reverence .
Examine them yourselves , then bring me your findings .
Fair sister , will you go with the princes or stay here with me ?
This is the man .
I'm afraid you'll keep going until then .
Very impressive .
And wanted to see you with laces crisscrossed over your legs." Crisscrossed ?
A golden mind doesn't bend down to choose something worthless .
We will do the same .
Oh , I wish I were a man !
No .
If her eyes were in the night sky , they would shine so brightly through space that birds would start singing , thinking her light was the light of day .
Where are they supposed to come ?
Caesar !
You wouldn't have dared to tempt him so .
Sit down and rest .
I believe it won't stop moving and stand upright till Richard wears the wreath of the realm .
Moreover , out of mercy , the Constable urges you to remind your men to make their peace with God and repent , so that their souls may depart sweetly and peacefully from these fields where , poor wretches , their bodies will likely fall and fester .
Let playful people with light hearts dance .
And who is that ?
If you work for him , you're a fool and should wear a fool's cap. , So how's it going , uncle ?
You don't ?
Now you're sociable .
So were their daggers , which we found on their pillows , unwiped .
And if he ever has a wife , let her be more miserable when he dies than I am now .
Next thing you know , he'll be saying "widower Aeneas." "Widow Dido , " did you say ?
With God as my witness , I swear I have wept for yours .
Are you my daughter ?
Stop that alarm from ringing , it's scaring the islanders .
May God give their souls rest .
Yes , that's my husband's name .
My lady , should I lie in your lap ?
It would be hard , almost impossible .
Yes , or to wear cosmetics ?
Not very well , but I've met him several times .
Tonight we'll have dinner .
This is a horrible sight .
Get to the point , since we already know the truth .
By all means .
Hurry. , Oh , love , if you could only watch the battle today and see how expert I am at my craft .
This is Decius Brutus .
You would have made me treat them like a tyrant. , I'm done , my lord .
I am no tyrant but a Christian king , whose emotions are as tightly controlled as the wretches who languish in our prisons .
Well , what do you guess ?
His insane period is over .
Fathers , never trust your daughters just because they act obedient and innocent .
Until you get back , Nerissa and I will live like virgins and widows .
We will , my lord .
If you want to see your deceiver , then look at me .
Before the bat flies through the castle , and before the dung beetle makes his little humming noise to tell us it's nighttime , a dreadful deed will be done .
Well , that's just greedy .
I'm going to go drown myself .
The Right .
Dead , dead ?
There is no indication of the mighty army that surrounds them in his expression , nor has the long , sleepless night robbed his face of an ounce of color .
No , good goose , don't bite me .
As for your husband , he is noble , wise , and judicious , and he understands what the times require .
I am satisfied , as long as the maiden cities you talk of come with her .
First , you have to speak to the watchmen who accused them .
I'll hide behind the tapestry to hear what they say .
Duke Solinus , my husband , and both my children , and you two Dromios , who marked the day of my sons ' births with your own , come into the abbey with me for a new christening .
Oh , so madmen like you are also deaf .
For I'm sure that although you may know what temperance is , you've never experienced it firsthand .
Snap out of your daze .
Before he leaves this part of the forest , you'll change places : you'll be the one running away , and he'll be in love with you .
Go now and get cash .
Please lock the door and keep quiet .
Enough to buy everything you have declared .
Excuse me ?
Caesar wouldn't take the crown .
Add to these eight thousand four hundred knights , squires , and brave gentlemen , five hundred of whom were given the title of knight only yesterday .
You're helping the storm , not us .
You can judge for yourself what I mean .
There must be some political news from Venice , or some dangerous plot here in Cyprus has ruined his good mood .
Everything is gloomy , dark , and dreadful .
I hope so too , Madam .
These lords seem so astonished that they've lost their use of reason and can hardly believe what they see with their own eyes. , But whatever the reason for your losing your senses , you can know for sure that I'm Prospero , that same duke who was kicked out of Milan and landed on this same island where you landed , and became the lord of it .
He's married , madam .
Something about Cyprus .
If I can't do that , I can at least make the Moor so jealous that he can't think straight .
What are you going to do ?
Cassio's been wounded .
He doesn't know what he's saying .
Please , don't make fun of me .
As long as it's honorable , you can be sure that I'll let you use all my money and do everything I can to help you .
Where do you think he is now ?
If he is too insistent , tell him that romance is like a dance : it has its own rhythm and timing .
In Algiers , sir .
Is there any more , or is that it ?
I'll tell you as soon as I know , Richard , because at this point I have no idea .
Rulers abuse their power when they separate it from compassion .
Now , my sweet lord , you know how much I like you .
I sincerely hope it does you good , mangy rascal .
You drank horses' urine and water from scum-covered puddles that even animals would refuse .
Now he denies it a bit , and tries to laugh it off .
But who's coming ?
Tell me if it's good or bad , and I'll wait for the details .
You're mistaken .
Good morning , brother Bedford .
Then repeat this after me : you can't expect women to be faithful when men are so unreliable .
Leave me alone .
Who here is so vile that he doesn't love his country ?
The more I suffer , the more spiteful he becomes .
I'm the one , Hamlet .
Titania sleeps there sometimes at night , lulled to sleep among the flowers by dances and other delights .
Oh , here she comes .
I'll rest here .
We're in .
If I could win a lady by playing leapfrog or vaulting into my saddle with my armor on my back , though you may accuse me of boasting , I could easily get myself a wife .
So it is on earth .
I'd rather carry a reed that obviously can't protect me than a sword I can not lift .
But I'm still fairly high-ranking .
I'll vouch for that .
Isn't my name Hero ?
I'm going now .
Until then , I have to remain calm .
In the meantime , I'll raise an army that will surpass his .
I can't figure it out by myself !
Do that .
And did they ask you to tell Beatrice about this , madam ?
We would not want to die in the company of a man who fears to die with us .
Oh great , here come the Capulets .
We've all been duped .
If you forgive us , we'll make everything all right .
Can he deny it ?
Where are you going ?
Come , and you can have a queen .
But who cares .
The king made peace among all of us .
I am a spirit , yes , since I have a soul .
I wish you had told me you had a different father .
And find a poverty stricken gentleman who I can marry straightaway to Clarence's daughter .
We have not betrayed you .
Sure , but don't do it at full volume until there's no danger in it .
We'll win yet .
Very well taken , I believe , very wise .
Whenever he talks about her he can't stop laughing .
There he is !
You should tell Antonio what you hear , but don't do it suddenly , because it might upset him .
Your other daughter Regan will treat you kindly , you'll see .
Where is Montjoy , the herald ?
Is Fleance going with you ?
I desperately needed God's blessing , but the word "Amen" stuck in my throat .
Both fencers are bleeding , how do you feel , my lord ?
Don't you have a letter for me from the friar ?
Your children caused you trouble in your youth , but mine will bring you comfort in your old age .
Have mercy , Jesus ! , Wait , I was only dreaming .
EPHESUS Now what do you think ?
What are you saying ?
You have a beautiful half-sister , Octavia .
Oh , kill me !
He's conducting some business with my lady , and sooner or later he'll leave .
I'll drain the life out of him .
Oh , please be quiet .
To answer your question , ma'am , yes , he was friendly with those knights .
Bring here The gentleman who advised you To give away your land .
You're talking like some innocent girl who doesn't understand the ways of the world .
For my brother Edward's sake .
I myself , who am more indebted to you than anyone , have brought you this young scholar
No , he didn't get any by me .
Alas , our poor country !
Even someone with a good and virtuous nature might give way to a royal command .
Pile of dirt !
Oh , I'll beat him up for that !
He I can't tell what's going on .
Come along with me .
What else ?
Oh , my reputation , Iago , my reputation !
Jailer , keep an eye on him .
Look , here she comes .
Go to her and tell her for me .
Brutus , do not provoke me .
Afraid that your anger would not subside , she sent you word she was dead .
When a majestic king starts acting silly , then it's my duty to be blunt .
Oh , she knew very well that you were acting like you were in love without really knowing what love means .
I have to obey .
So I can eat lunch .
An annoying schoolboy , unworthy of such an honor , joined by a masquerader and a partier !
By the moon and stars !
I was ordered not to .
You're a traitor. , Off with his head .
That light is not daylight , I know it .
Oh , but she'll keep her word .
But when push comes to shove , they droop like those horses that are all show and slow to a crawl .
Do you hear that , men ?
You're in a bad mood ?
So , there's the signal to ride .
I hope you'll be a good father to me now .
Help me out of here , quickly !
On top of her ?
You should pity me for that reason , not hate me .
What dangers are you trying to lead me into , Cassius , that you want me to look inside myself for something that's not there ?
He seems cheerful .
He deserves only honor , complete honor .
But how did you want it made ?
I hope lightning strikes her in the eyes !
If you weren't my brother , I'd leave this hand of mine on your neck until I'd pulled out your tongue for talking like this .
Set him free .
Look , my love , what are those streaks of light in the clouds parting in the east ?
He'll never agree to that .
Close the garden door and leave me alone to hear his message .
Dear father , if you caused this terrible storm with your magic powers , please put an end to it .
What kept you from telling him this ?
I will proclaim my name around the field .
I knew him when he listened to nothing but the military drum and fife ; now he would rather hear the sweet and refined music of the tabor and pipe .
Did you call for me , your Worship ?
It's tragic because Pyramus kills himself .
She was a hellcat in school .
I hope not .
I'm sorry , but I memorized what I'm supposed to say here today , and that question isn't part of the speech I learned .
Shylock , are you listening ?
I'm a soldier , more experienced than you , and better able to give orders .
We're not saying anything treasonous , man .
Yeah , right , you sent me to get whipped .
I didn't , my lord .
There's nothing to fear in him .
But if you would be willing to accept circumstantial evidence as proof , we can get that .
Did you see anything ?
Oh , I'd rather have met my fiercest enemy in heaven , Horatio , than have lived through that terrible day !
I'll do what I can , more than I'd do for myself .
What if I am ?
Clouds , dissolve into rain , so that I could say the gods themselves are weeping !
I'll drink to Hamlet's health , and into his goblet I'll drop a pearl even more costly than those in the crowns of the last four Danish kings .
He's given his empire to a whore , and now they're gathering kings to wage a war .
And as surely as I am alive , I am a virgin .
I remember the first time Caesar ever put it on .
This is just another one of the hallucinations you always get when you're afraid .
Well , enjoy the sweetness of deep sleep .
I'll meet you there in an hour .
Say , "That splendid Antony." The courageous Caesar !
This is an asp's trail , and these fig leaves have slime on them , just like the kind that asps deposit on the caves by the Nile .
You will never fall victim to Benedick's charms , my niece .
How are you , Roderigo ?
I wish I could see that man someday !
Amen .
So could I .
From now on this is what I'll think of your love .
You absolute villain !
Here's a goat for you .
Your lieutenant , Cassio .
Why , too much freedom leads to woe .
I have it ready for you .
Are you backing away in fear ?
Me too , I won't , I swear to God .
Come with me now , and help me out .
I have news from Rome , my good lord .
He looked to the side , and pay attention to what he saw then : under an oak tree , whose lower branches were mossy with age and top branches ancient and brittle , he saw a wretched beggar , with overgrown hair and beard , asleep on his back .
Do you really mean that ?
It doesn't look that way to me .
I'm sure I'll never get married in the way my sisters say they're married , loving their father only .
I'll sleep here until morning .
I am content , if that's the way you want it .
Look out , here she comes .
So , if they die unprepared , the king is no more guilty of their damnation than he was guilty of the earlier crimes they're finally being punished for .
But sir , he's crazy .
Ah-ha !
A fair woman !
Observe how Antony takes his defeat and how his attitude influences his actions .
Miranda. , Oh father , I've disobeyed you by telling him that !
I never saw a better-designed gown , more elegant and pleasing and well made .
She will A pimp !
Indeed , you would be out if I were your mistress , if my chastity is worth as much as my wit .
Petruchio , let's stand over here awhile .
I have news for you about the Prince's punishment .
He'll never follow anything that other men have started .
Do not run away .
I hope your love for me remains this strong for your entire life !
And , in fact , I think they're meeting together right now .
But yet , madam , I don't like the sound of "but yet." It reverses all the good that came before it .
To die for adultery ?
Am I a married man or a bachelor ?
I'd rather be a baboon than kill myself out of love for some woman I can't have .
When devoutly religious men are praying , it's hard to draw them out of it , because they get lost in the wonder of their contemplation .
What is that bloody knife ?
What's the matter with you now ?
You killed my child .
It's as common for us old people to assume we know more than we do as for young people to be too wild and crazy .
Really , niece , you'll never get a husband if you keep saying such harsh things about people .
I didn't do anything .
Give me your hand , Kate .
His crime did justice's job by taking Tybalt's life .
Banquo and Macbeth , all hail !
Puppet" ?
The old king was so overjoyed by this promise that he gave young Fortinbras an annual income of three thousand I like this news , and when I have time I'll read this and think about how to reply .
Who's in there ?
How goes it , friend Eros ?
No one .
I just beg death to wait awhile , until I place the last of our many thousands of kisses on your lips .
Oh , mighty Caesar !
I'm not like you .
Come on .
Please wear this ring .
I don't know what to say .
Ah , but I know you .
And has my armor been put in my tent ?
Don't kneel , noble Portia .
These recent eclipses of the sun and moon don't bode well for us .
Now , my friendly servant , thank you .
Sir , he ate with this woman at the Porcupine .
I haven't seen such a promising candidate for your love .
Maria !
If you can love me for this , take me .
You horrid slave , you can't be trained to be good , and you're capable of anything evil !
If she lives a long and happy life , then all women may as well turn into monsters .
You can trust me .
Noble friends , let's kill him boldly but not with anger .
Everyone knows where a wasp wears its stinger .
I came here to tell you , I'll make this short , since she's already been talked about for too long , the lady is unfaithful .
Who's the spokesman for Edmund , Earl of Gloucester ?
Come on , sir , please .
Musicians , play us a song. , Prince , you look sad .
The more I hate him , the more he follows me around .
Or if you haven't broken away from human company , as my feelings now lead me to do , you haven't loved .
Let's go .
A fox you've trapped And such a daughter Should both be slaughtered , If my fool's cap is worth a rope to bind them .
Hey out there !
The king is not responsible for it .
Don't attack by land .
If I'm more noble than you , you've done me wrong .
They would like me to be as familiar with men's pockets as their gloves and handkerchiefs , which goes against my manhood , because to take something from another's pocket and put it into my own is plain stealing .
My eyesight has always been bad .
Don't be late .
Only men whom you wouldn't trust anyway would swear oaths , and for the worst reasons .
And it might back up other evidence that may seem too flimsy .
Most mighty sovereign , you have no reason to doubt my friendship .
If I had the goddess Juno's power , I would make the strong-winged messenger , Mercury , pick you up and seat you beside Jove .
Have them come in .
My darling , when I gave my love to you , I told you that all the wealth I had ran within my veins , that I have noble blood , but no money .
But you've raised me as a peasant , hiding from me what I needed to become a gentleman .
Hello to you .
Oh , no , good gentleman !
Yes , I have great cause to be thankful .
Who do you think ?
Didn't you call him a liar ?
Where are the evil men who started this fight ?
Not offensive at all .
I'll call for you soon .
Can't you talk about anything besides ladies ?
I'll go , sir , and I won't bother you .
Ratcliffe , come here .
But silence , like a knife , cuts open my heart With strokes that draw no blood .
Andrew Aguecheek"
Antonio , I married a woman as dear to me as life itself .
It's almost morning .
You rudely snuck out of bed .
Yes , but I didn't see anything wrong , and I heard every syllable they said .
No ship could survive this storm .
They really wish they were somewhere else , but they want to descend on us , looking fierce so we'll think they're brave .
I will perform this ceremony every year .
Is he man enough at this point to face off with Tybalt ?
Here come the conspirators .
I'll drink later .
Oh God , remember to hear her prayer for them , just as for us !
Be quick for a while and let the one who lives the longest take everything .
That's my sister .
All right , you've had your say , but we'll let the forest judge whether or not you spoke wisely .
Are you so patient and forgiving that you're going to let him off the hook ?
Gentlemen , can any of you tell me where I can find young Romeo ?
I'll take it over to the pile .
It's almost morning .
My wife was killed too ?
Thieves !
You're not really my daughter , but I still have one daughter left .
That's it ?
Answer me in a word .
Sometimes all I want to do is see plays and go out dancing .
But that would ruin his reputation !
But you have to .
I asked you again , and you scratched your head and stamped your foot impatiently .
I don't know what you mean by that , but I'm sure Caesar fell down .
I did .
Oh , Bottom , you've changed !
You did it ?
I'm good at everything that ordinary men can do .
Were you listening to these verses ?
dusk and all night long sleeps in peace .
Get yourself to a church and have a proper priest , who can tell you what marriage is all about , marry you .
I have a lot to tell you about them .
Did she give up all those chances to marry noblemen , give up her father and country and friends , just to be called a whore ?
Sorry , I'm all stuffed .
Is that why you're talking so wildly ?
It's certain .
What a silly monster , to think a poor drunk is wonderful .
I don't
Bring me to my host , Macbeth .
That's it .
Go to the church .
You who are so skilled in cursing , stay awhile and teach me how to curse my enemies .
When courage consumes reason , it destroys its only weapon .
Listen , I hear them .
You'll get there two days before me .
Only he acted from honesty and for the general good .
Let me speak proudly : tell the Constable we're only workaday soldiers .
First of all , even if all the obstacles were eliminated and my path led straight to the crown , if it were truly my birthright , I would rather hide from my greatness than hide inside the greatness of the position itself and be smothered by it .
So she was moved by it ?
His running away has everything to do with fear and nothing to do with love .
A lioness gave birth in the streets , and graves cracked open and thrust out their dead .
Is it possible dat I sould love de enemy of France ?
Right now I'd give a thousand
The more I try to hide what I'm feeling , the bigger it gets .
You know , I saw the Duchess of Milan's gown , the one that everyone praises so highly .
Let life be short so that shame won't last too long .
What kind of beard should I wear for the part ?
We'll bring him to his house with shouts and celebration !
At the bottom , any change is for the better .
It has come again .
Tell me .
What do you think about it ?
Should we go find Benedick and tell him about Beatrice's love ?
This is a classic example of the idiocy of the world : when we're down and out , often because of our own excesses , we put all the blame on the sun , the moon , and the stars , as if they forced us to be bad , or the heavens compelled us to be villainous or stupid .
My master's house .
Where have I been ?
The privilege of never seeing me again .
What , are you hurt ?
I'll wake him , because that's my job .
What's the matter ?
Dressing my out-and-out wickedness in scraps of Scripture , I look like a saint exactly when I'm most like the devil .
Richmond is sailing on the sea .
If I repeated it to you , it would kill you as soon as you heard it .
That's just what he said in the letter .
I know his soul's in heaven , fool .
And yet for all that , if she didn't hate him to death , she'd love him to death .
After midnight , for two nights running , these two guards , Marcellus and Barnardo , saw a figure that looked very much like your father , in full armor from head to toe .
I have to pretend to threaten you with my sword .
You don't think you can teach her ?
But back to that argument you mentioned .
Well , let me get back to my choice .
Shylock is my name .
I have lived long enough .
The heart won't be reasoned with .
The crowd that follows Caesar at his heels , senators , justices , common petitioners , will suffocate a feeble man almost to death .
Within three hours Juliet will wake up .
We'll watch a whole play tomorrow .
So get out of here !
This used to be a great puzzle , but now I've solved it .
The best thing about me is that I'm hardworking .
They're natural enough." I think these things are omens of things to come in our country .
If you wish to speak of love , speak more softly .
Then I'll see you again ?
Sir and madam , to make grand speeches about what majesty is , what service is , or why day is day , night is night , and time is time is just a waste of a lot of day , night , and time .
Read it .
Please take them .
And you have mercy on me too !
No one shows mercy because he has to .
You've been competing with this king for my daughter .
I lead a charmed life , which can't be ended by anyone born from a woman .
It's proper that we speak first , which is why we sent our proposals ahead of us for your consideration .
I'll deliver the message .
In cash .
Have his daughters made him crazy like this ? , Couldn't you have kept something for yourself ?
Can I justifiably and in good conscience make this claim ?
Thank you very much .
I'm glad he wasn't here for this fight .
I don't have to give you answers that you like .
You hit my servants , and your disorderly mob of knights treat their superiors like servants .
Who are you ?
Whom do you serve under ?
Please don't be angry .
Damn you for mocking me .
Soldier , why are you wearing that glove in your cap ?
He knows I recognize him .
And here's my mistress , Titania .
How could so many people , under two masters , get along under one roof ?
Come on , you're being too hard on yourself .
Here .
I'd like to know .
One more thing , good gentlemen .
We owe you love and service forever .
His horse is better than the Neapolitan's and he frowns more than the Count Palatine .
Damn that Toby !
When she was dying she gave it to me and told me to give it to my wife when I got married .
Yes , yes , and let's sing in unison , like two gypsies riding on a single horse .
And I'll sing it for the duke in the intermission of a play .
You are about as much of a thinker as worm's meat is a nice steak .
What do you say ?
We'll mutiny .
We've got to act fast , my lord of the fairies .
Our love , which right now is like a flower bud in the summer air , may turn out to be a beautiful flower by the next time we meet .
It does have a back like a weasel's .
Signor Martino and his wife and daughters , Count Anselme and his beautiful sisters , Vitruvio's widow , Signor Placentio and his lovely nieces , Mercutio and his brother Valentine , My uncle Capulet and his wife and daughters , My fair niece Rosaline and Livia ,
I'm amazed you got here before me .
Have you heard this , Cassio ?
Romeo killed Tybalt .
Please , stop bowing , good sir .
Did he beg my pardon ?
I'll
We'll answer .
It's midnight .
Our army has recently acquired many of Mark Antony's former soldiers , enough to capture him .
Sir , I make my living using an awl .
You make me so happy .
What's the news ?
Three thousand ducats .
Please let me be your servant so I can be with you .
This is that time .
I'm critical by nature .
If we leave , it will feel like nothing less than death to them .
If he's got a message from the count , tell him I'm sick , or not home .
No one's life should have been entrusted to them .
But then he said strange things to me .
The ship was already sailing .
Tell me your secrets .
Three of the carriages are very imaginatively designed , and they match the fencing accessories .
It blesses the one who gives it and the one who receives it .
Yes , it truly is .
He must be possessed by the devil .
I have no interest in getting mixed up with the devil .
Do you want to get married , fool ?
You know what I intend .
Political business is bothering him , and he's just taking it out on you .
Let George Stanley die after the battle .
I've never seen a creature with a human shape who was so eager to destroy a man .
I suggest you lay low until his rage cools a little .
I'm at your service until death .
There never was a monarch better feared and loved than yourself , your Majesty .

This island belongs to me because Sycorax , my mother , left it to me .
I'll never believe a madman until I can see his brains .
Why do you look like that ?
We need some oracle to tell us what's going on .
The lark shrilly singing up there is too far away to be heard .
Keep me balanced and sane .
My daughter is still very young .
God forbid !
By watching their show , you'll find out everything you're likely to know .
I heard someone say that's what it means .
I wish you well .
That's what's driving her crazy .
I did that to him .
I've heard of men who pick fights with other people on purpose , just to see how brave they are .
I'll read it aloud .
Don't ask to see this letter .
Ah , poor ghost !
I have to stop you , Cimber .
He is an animal worthy of Perseus .
Then we can all three be comrades on our way to France .
It's just my bad luck .
Keep an eye on her .
He's been gone for nine years and he's leaving again soon .
He calls me "boy" and scolds me as if he had the power to whip me out of Egypt .
I am sorry for her , as I should be , since I am both her uncle and her guardian .
He is the prince of horses .
Fool , do not flatter yourself .
We don't think so , my lord .
Tell her that the entire East shall call her Queen." Then he nodded and solemnly mounted an armored warhorse , which neighed so loudly it effectively silenced anything I might have said in reply .
I've been poisoned .
Go to the gate .
Have you told her our decision ?
They told me I was everything .
Tell him a messenger has arrived from my master with good news .
Goodbye .
Benvolio is part of the Montague family .
Go , but sign the deed .
The great emperor Caesar , dead and turned to clay , might plug up a hole to keep the wind away .
But never mind .
His daughter and I will be king and queen , God protect us ! , and you and Trinculo will be our governors. , Do you like that idea , Trinculo ?
Be quiet , boy , or you'll lose your mind .
He'll grow up to be a proper man .
I'm suddenly afraid .
While I was looking for a flint to light it , I found this paper on the window , sealed up like this , and I'm sure it wasn't there when I went to bed .
What are these things we're looking at , my lord Antonio ?
Please , my king , be quiet .
If you make the accusation convincingly , then my cunning won't fail me .
Where the devil can Romeo be ?
Come , find the conspirators !
I've got to go .
They're as opposite as hot and cold .
So go away .
Never , my lord .
Brutus , you give a nice speech along with your evil strokes .
How do you mean ?
Good night , brother .
Look at all the devoted servants who work for their masters their whole lives for nothing but their food , and then when they get old they're terminated .
She's dead , she's dead , she's dead !
Welcome to Elsinore .
Young boy , I wish I could make you believe that I'm in love .
Please grant my prayer so my faith doesn't turn to despair .
He's gone ?
Oh , give us permission , great king , to search the field in safety and dispose of our dead bodies .
What an idiot I was to think this drunkard was a god and to worship such a stupid fool !
Isn't my vest just as clean and fresh as the day I put it on ?
What's your name ?
Some say the lark makes a sweet division between day and night .
Will no one back me up ?
He's a traitor .
Something's wrong , the man sounds panicked .
How wonderful my master is !
Has Fortune turned on me , like the whore she is ?
There's no room for the old man and his followers .
No .
What do you think you're doing ?
What an annoying man , this guy is !
A dog from that house will make me angry enough to take a stand .
Right now , my pressing business calls me away .
I remember .
He uses his clownishness to disguise his deadly wit .
I ask for him , and he comes .
Look , here comes someone who loves me , along with someone who loves her .
Oh , it's a disaster , a disaster , by this hand , it's a disaster .
You flea , you louse , you winter cricket !
I won't mess with him .
No you haven't , cousin .
Two or three men are groaning .
Sir Topas , Sir Topas , good Sir Topas , please go find my lady Olivia , Get out , demon !
Ah , here she comes , angry and sad .
You are my other self , my oracle , my prophet , my dear brother !
Then I beat my drum , at which point they pricked up their ears and opened their eyes , looking around for the source of my music .
It seems not .
Your scolding is somewhat overblown .
When a woman is virtuous , talents like these just make her better .
Say anything .
I'll give him some liquor .
Yes , the state's half can be reduced , but not Antonio's .
With all my heart , I'll go right away .
Where did you learn that song , Fool ?
My child , my reason for living , wake up , look up , or I'll die with you !
Be as lazy and neglectful as you like around him , you and the other servants .
How excellent for Antony !
All is lost !
It's a skull with a scroll in its empty eye socket .
I'll pick berries for you .
No !
I'll never be satisfied with Romeo until I see him .
Drink up .
It's my master who's not getting the reward he deserves , not me .
Past noon .
Let him come forward .
Don't be afraid of her company .
My dear lord , if it was you who conquered her and took her virginity , I know what you're about to say .
Take care of the lady .
Oh God , he's murdered his master !
The main body of the army is expected here any hour now .
You have all served me well , and kings are your peers .
Dorset , embrace Hastings. , Hastings , express your affection for the marquess of Dorset .
Nevertheless , it's all one , the two rivers are as alike as my fingers are to my fingers , and there are salmon in both .
Become a better
Go to my brother Cassius .
I'd rather have my horse than a mistress .
I don't know you .
The muffled queen" is good .
Who is it ?
My brother Gloucester's voice ?
Beware of March 15th .
No one else would .
You do the same .
Listen , sad friends , though the gods may rebuke me , this news would make kings cry .
Why are you making them work so hard ?
Even the fragile wren , the smallest of birds , will fight against the owl when it threatens her young ones in the nest .
Let's see .
Oh , there's been a lot of quarreling .
So what's the story , old boy ?
But I don't worry about being deceived because I don't need to trust .
Quiet !
No , madam , no .
I can't believe I was scared of him !
What a fool I've been !
Just a minute ago I was the owner of this beautiful mansion , master of these servants , and queen over myself .
It looks like you've offended it .
Will you help me ? , What an ass and a fool , a gullible no-good idiot !
Come , father , I'll leave you at a friend's house .
I need to get Othello's things from the ship .
Shall I accompany your Grace ?
And if our navy wins tomorrow , no doubt our army will do their part .
What ?
Goodbye .
A tiny spot of evil casts doubt on their good qualities and ruins their reputations .
No .
No , not him , though his face is more handsome than any man's , and his legs are prettier , and as for his hands and feet and body , they're not much to speak of , and yet they're beyond compare .
What did I promise , my dear ?
Help !
God Almighty , there must be some essential goodness even in evil , if men would only look for it .
Is she enclosed in silver , which is ten times less valuable than gold ?
Stop right there , sir .
If they'd put you in the stocks for asking that question , you would've deserved it .
I'll bandy you about and overwhelm you with my cleverness .
I don't know his name .
I'm here .
Yes , leeks are good .
So , tell us , did you see that thing again tonight ?
Hunting what , Curio ?
Why is that cauldron sinking ?
Come on , let's go see the king .
Fast asleep ?
Keep my lover quiet .
Convince him that he has been out of his mind , and when he says he's out of his mind My lord , I promise we will play our parts so skillfully that he will believe everything we tell him .
Saint Francis , help me !
All right , then .
I'll give the Queen a hearing and grant her requests if she either throws her dishonored friend out of Egypt or kills him .
Come here , boy .
Go ahead , but I won't listen .
Come along , though .
May you choke on any other sentiments like that !
Oh , is that Kent ?
Sir , is everyone in your family at home ?
Yes , exactly .
What's going on in here ?
Which of us are you referring to ?
I'll fight every one of these devils if I have to , one at a time .
I'll play the part wearing either a straw-colored beard , or a sandy beard , or a red beard , or one of those bright yellow beards that's the color of a French coin .
What do you want me to do with this ?
It's easier to buy young people than to beg or borrow them .
It's better that you didn't kill him .
You come with me , uncle of Exeter .
My features are still that beautiful , or else you , the greatest soldier in the world , have become the greatest liar by overpraising them .
You'll get a blow from me for that , I think .
You're making me go off-key .
Oh , the man who avenged her could ask anything of me !
No , add a couple more syllables .
I look forward to getting to know you better .
Has there ever been a time , I'd really like to know , when I've definitely said something was true , and it turned out not to be true ?
I will , my lord .
Be patient , your highness .
The man who gives away his crust and his crumbs Will discover that he needs some crumbs back .
With his ambition growing like this , do you hear what I'm saying ?
If they do this , as they will , God willing , my ransom will soon be raised .
But I do think it's the husband's fault if we wives cheat on them .
You and I , and honest Casca , we have epilepsy , we've fallen .
You're in the charge of an honorable man .
Get out of my sight !
That counts for everything .
Which one of you is Beatrice ?
But tell me , are you speaking seriously ?
When she landed at the port , Antony sent an invitation for her to come to supper .
Angelo , the jeweler .
I wouldn't want to stay here and make you angry .
Wake up !
As for this slave , Iago , if we can think of any torture that will hurt him a lot but keep him alive a long time , he'll have it .
Lepidus is red in the face .
Here , take this piece of jewelry .
Get information from her .
The two of us together will sing like birds in a cage .
This box was tested in the fire seven times .
I went to many places where I heard news about her , but I couldn't find her .
My gracious lord , I should tell you what I saw , but I don't know how to say it .
The kind that tells you that the Moor is having sex with your daughter right now .

The king , the king's to blame .
If I live long enough to touch you again , that would be as good as having my eyesight back .
So stop crying .
Drawing your sword on a woman ?
And you can do poor things that lead to rich results .
That , stirred up by Dorset , Buckingham , and Morton , he's coming to England to claim the crown .
I feel this pinprick .
O flesh , flesh , you've turned pale and weak like a fish .
Let me go with him .
Feeling the loss like this , I can't help but weep for him forever .
I plan to fall into the blackest despair .
Thanks , my good countryman .
Then what's Antony ?
Then don't move while I act out my prayer .
My lady , with your permission , this note authorizes me to give myself to you with a kiss .
This poor virgin isn't much to look at , sir , but she's mine .
There goes a strong fellow , Menas .
Big , round tears ran piteously down the animal's innocent nose .
Do they attract big audiences ?
The humiliation that the king is suffering now will be revenged thoroughly .
I know the man a bit .
My lord , here is the entrance .
Right on time .
The clock hasn't struck yet .
What , from myself ?
Bring me this plant , and get back here before the sea monster has time to swim three miles .
I will do so .
I'm sure you and my husband will be as friendly as you were before .
If things are the way people tell me they are , and they're only telling me this to warn me , then I have to say , you're not conducting yourself with the self-restraint a daughter of mine should show .
There's no scarier wild bird than the living lion , and we should remember that .
Now , don't forget , you promised me something .
That doesn't matter .
Then meet me right away at the notary's .
Most noble sir , stand up .
Who , Hero ?
You lowlife son-of-a-bitch !
You were supposed to be proving that there isn't time for everything .
If this were a play , I'd complain it was unrealistic .
I wouldn't think much of it even if it were heavier .
My reputation , my reputation !
But you're lying out in the cold .
Enough .
I'll shut up now .
I feel sorry for you .
Great Mark Antony is a widower now .
The king is coming here tonight .
Would you ever do such a thing for all the world ?
Listen !
Oh , that's disgusting !
Yes .
All this is comforting news .
Spring , summer , fertile autumn and angry winter have all changed places , and now the confused world doesn't know which is which .
And yet I'll still have plenty .
Yes , Casca .
That's really news !
The will !
Please , tell me your cure .
Please , give my regards to your mother , Mrs. Peapod , and your father , Mr. Peapod .
In Orsino's heart .
Go and get her dressed .
What do you think , will my friends prove loyal ?
Oh , teach me how you look the way you do , and which tricks you used to make Demetrius fall in love with you .
We'll speak again tomorrow .
If it's true that you don't need
What are you doing , Caesar ?
Come on now , wine is good for you , if you know how to use it .
But she is wise .
Please , father , since you're weak , act like it .
He received me with courtesy and sufficient respect , but not with affection , nor with as much open and friendly conversation as he once greeted me .
You gentle Romans , Quiet there !
It orders me to hand the noble duke of Clarence over to you .
I'm so amazed by this , I don't know what to say .
Many people faint when they see blood .
It's time to hide , wretched Margaret .
He was the one who denounced his father .
Why do you want to do that , my lord ?
Good luck , worthy soldier , and good-bye .
Madam .
I can't offer her more than all I have .
Therefore your relatives are no obstacle .
If he did that , it would be a charitable deed to hang him .
Well , for your good looks , sir , thank God and don't boast about it .
I'm not a man who talks a lot , but I thank you .
And then ?
Look , I don't love you , so stop following me around .
Play your flutes !
But for a fine , elegant , graceful , and excellent dress , yours is worth ten of those .
I'm here , here !
You notorious whore !
Did you speak to him ?
I assure you , sir , the tender love I feel in my heart is stronger than the sexual passions stirring down below .
Well , that's a fine answer .
I'll forget that I have any home besides this spot right here .
Where are your sister and Hortensio's wife ?
Whom should we look for in the castle ? , Whose job is it ?
I think of as many things as he does , but I just thank heaven and don't show off about it .
It's not manly .
Some startling news has just arrived , sir .
Dolabella !
What ?
I can't do this .
You're on .
And here's another poem , which I stole from my cousin's pocket , in her handwriting and all about her adoration for Benedick .
Do my simple features please you ?
Let's hear what Antony has to say .
What do you want ?
Little birds do it , and dragonflies copulate right in front of me .
Shall I put it plainly ?
Why did you cry out in your sleep ?
Under Captain Gower , my liege .
That's very true , mangy rascal , when it pleases God .
Not by the likes of you !
Cassio , how did you get my wife's handkerchief ?
They were planning to pull a mischievous trick on Ferdinand and Miranda , who have sworn not to sleep together till their wedding day .
Why did Cassius conspire against Caesar ?
We'll have the barber trim it later , along with your beard .
That's good , Lion !
Thank you , brave Cassio .
Me too .
I know your position .
Go walk the path that you will never return from .
You haven't seen him since ?
There are many troubles brewing now that have yet to become full-fledged threats .
I'll take you to where he sleeps , and you can pound a nail into his head .
But I'm a hired hand : I don't profit from the flocks I tend .
How do you both plead ?
Good morning to you , friend .
Farewell , hostess .
Did you hear a noise ?
This is beyond words and beyond belief !
You could only imitate his imperfections so well if you were the man himself .
Let tornadoes spew water until the steeples of our churches and the weathervanes are all drowned .
Good riddance ! , Close the curtains and leave. , I hope everyone who looks like him will make the same choice .
Quiet !
Even that I could put up with .
Play the kind of music that puts people to sleep .
That's true .
Are you over your ridiculous mood ?
I know you from before .
How literal this guy is !
If you wish .
Henry the Sixth , crowned king of France and England while still in his infancy , succeeded him .
The king will be offended to find out that his messenger is so badly treated .
The enemy gets larger each day .
I'll pay you for your trouble .
Come on , take control of your feelings .
Go wherever you want .
But in this way , grief and comfort appear together .
I remember you took the throne from your brother Prospero .
Dromio ?
My lord , your son has paid the soldier's price : death .
You are very welcome here , sir .
Stay invisible .
No stony tower , no brass walls , no airless dungeon , no iron chains can contain a strong mind .
Get up .
Hurry up .
I've found it out .
He can hold his fingers in a V-shape like this , and Pyramus and Thisbe can whisper to each other through that little crack .
We were pushed out of power by evil deeds , as you call them .
If you were the noblest of your family , young man , you couldn't die more honorably .
These past fifteen years you have been living in a dream , and even when you were awake , it was as though you slept .
Do you want to know the truth ?
Yes , sir , we're part of her entourage .
That may be true , my lord .
Thank you , sir .
All I'm asking for is to have that little human boy as part of my crew .
And even though you were brought up as a gentleman , you patiently tolerated more hardships than savages could withstand .
Are these our eyes ?
down , and then say also that in Aleppo I once saw a Turk beating a Venetian , so I grabbed the Turk by the throat and hit him like this .
You know how young my daughter is .
How could that happen ?
Here , I'll tell you my whole plan in my carriage , which is waiting for us at the gate .
Calphurnia's face is pale , and Cicero's eyes are as red and fiery as they get when senators are arguing with him at the Capitol .
So cheer up .
Stop !
They should advance immediately , because I sense Octavius's side is a bit fainthearted right now , and a sudden push would overthrow him .
If they'll do neither , we'll come to them and make them fly like stones shot from powerful slings .
You don't have to tell us what Lord Hamlet said .
When we're born , we cry because we've arrived on the stage of life , like all the other fools .
What , you mean kid actors ?
Say no more .
I can't put my feelings into verse , but please believe I love you best , oh , best of all .
I'd obey even if she were my mother ten times over .
What do you have to say to me now ?
The rain , the wind , the thunder and lightning are not my daughters .
What a farce !
God knows I waited for you in anguish , pain , and agony when I gave birth to you .
The glowworm's light is beginning to fade , so morning is near .
I don't care what he told you in Latin .
Oh , how stupid !
I'm Trinculo , don't be scared , your good friend Trinculo .
Help , help , help !
I'll hound him .
My lady would never want to lose him .
Why are you frowning like that ?
Virginity makes her look sick and green .
Lady Strachy married her wardrobe manager .
I could do without another toast .
He killed your relative , brave Mercutio , and then young Romeo killed him .
My own flesh and blood turned against me !
Speak , Claudio , that's your cue .
Even the best jewel can be tarnished .
Don't go back until I've carried the corpse into the marketplace .
Do you want to sink ?
Twenty crowns .
Come on , let's go see King Edward .
All the rumors have been confirmed .
Don't deny to him that you love me .
You've stolen both my job and my name !
Now I go , a jolly , thriving wooer , to marry my brother Edward's young daughter , Elizabeth , because I know Richmond has his eye on her .
Has Romeo killed himself ?
With her , on top of her , however you want to say it .
Farewell , my lord .
It fell on a little western flower , which used to be white as milk but now has turned purple from being wounded by the arrow of love .
Your eyes are like stars , and your voice is more musical than a lark's song is to a shepherd in the springtime .
You defend yourself by blaming my judgment , but you're just making up feeble excuses .
I slept well , ate well , and was happy .
But that's just a fairy tale .
I hate an ungrateful man more than I hate lying , vanity , babbling , drunkenness , or any other vice that we feeble human beings are susceptible to. , Oh , my God !
Pay you ?
So please , most gracious duke , order her to bring him out so we can get him some help .
I've told you what I intend to do , and I've sworn by the holy Sabbath to seek the penalty that is due according to our contract .
Cassius , stand firm .
I would've been happy if the whole army had had sex with her , the lowest-ranking grunts and all , as long as I didn't know anything about it .
Yes , as safe as her brothers ' lives were .
Meanwhile , after you .
All right then , legitimate brother Edgar , I have to have your lands .
I know how his mind works .
I have forgotten why I called you back .
But the enemy is loud .
The foulest fate would be most appropriate for me now in this latest phase of my life .
Is this face Hero's ?
No , you'll have to excuse me .
It would have been better if , after she said , "Tybalt's dead , " she told me my mother or my father , or both , were gone .
We have not yet set the coronation day .
If he says anything against me , I'll humble him , even if he were stronger than he is , and twenty punks like him .
No one here is affected by your curse , because curses are just words with no power .
Okay , but please not before me .
Good day to you , sir .
What , out in a storm in the middle of the night ?
My stupid heart , which I'm leaving behind here .
Madam , if you can find a man to deliver the poison , I'll mix it myself so that Romeo will sleep quietly soon after he drinks it .
My own flesh and blood rebels against me !
Everyone else , march on with me .
If either of you knows any secret reason why you two should not be joined in marriage , I order you on your souls to say so .
Oh , killing that child was the dirtiest , most merciless deed there ever was !
I'm a poor man who's been humbled by many misfortunes .
You should've saved me some trouble and taken it away yourself .
You won't find any cause for anxiety , even if you look for one .
Kneel down to the duke before he passes by the abbey .
He's walking ahead of me , and he keeps daring me to follow him .
I am indebted to you for your last sermon .
My dream told me that dreamers often lie .
I beg your pardon for loving you too much .
I assure your majesty I'm only doing my duty both to my God and my good king .
Cesario , come here .
Pray , let me stay .
Master , you were so focused on the girl herself , I wonder if you missed the main point here .
Until recently , I was as unimportant to his affairs as the morning dew is to the wide ocean .
Yes , a thousand times .
Speak , I command you .
But Lysander's so attractive that he's turned heaven into hell !
I told you before , and I'll tell you again and again : I hate the Moor .
God has blessed you with a good name .
So the candle went out and now we're all in the dark .
No , I don't , my lord .
He carries himself like a dignified gentleman , and , to tell you the truth , he has a reputation throughout Verona as a virtuous and well-behaved young man .
But I have a sinking feeling anyway .
For three months .
How did he get such an idea ?
Look how she carries on with him !
If he's caught , he'll never make trouble for anyone again .
You're a good judge of horsemanship .
Does a madman scare me when he stares at me ?
Knock , sir ?
You gave money to me ?
Yes , unfortunately .
Oh , are you going to leave me so unsatisfied ?
Yes , I am .
Therefore , tremble with fear and leave .
So listen up , princess .
They only like things as bad as themselves .
My murders will never come back to threaten me until the forest of Birnam gets up and moves , and I will be king for my entire natural life .
Oh , I've been murdered unfairly !
Fresh beauty attracts thugs and thieves even more than money .
Grant their law-abiding request !
Good question , my girl .
Don't think of any beauty But the beauty of Rosalind .
With half the world opposing the other half , it wasn't the time for Antony , the pivotal player , to let love distract him .
It's a big prize for such a small sin .
You will feel the loss , but the man you weep for will feel nothing .
What's going on ?
At other times , I know what's what .
I hear it now overhead .
Hurry up , I say .
But so what ?
I don't like that .
But , look , poor me , what a terrible tragedy is here !
Picture the linen sails driven by the invisible and subtle wind as they pull the vast hulls through the wrinkled sea , breasting the high waves .
Your husband lies dead there , and Paris too .
Absolutely , if you can find a wife by then .
It's expressly against the rules of combat .
Yes , do you hear me , Balthasar ?
Gentlemen , I hope you are well .
I can't believe that dog , that rat , that mouse , that cat could scratch me to death !
Well , should we hear some music ?
If you don't , if I'm left alone , I swear I'll have that legal expert as my bedfellow .
Could you really do such a thing , for all the world ?
Say something !
Be merciful and say "death." Exile is much worse than death .
Your Grace heard their saccharine words , but didn't take note of their poisonous intentions .
Do you see something wrong with that ?
Many former friends of ours have gathered to meet the fleet and aren't willing to beat it back .
Okay , just stay quiet .
That's a nasty garter belt .
No , you shall not .
Any strange beast there can be considered a man .
How do you feel , Laertes ?
I'll marry the earl of Warwick's youngest daughter , Lady Anne .
Goodbye to you all .
Thinking , my lord ? " My God , you keep repeating everything I say as if you were thinking something too horrible to say out loud .
No , you'll see , four days will quickly turn into four nights .
Please give me a little credit !
He's a king , a king !
You've pretended to be in love with her , singing fake love songs softly at her window by moonlight , and you've captured her imagination by giving her locks of your hair , rings , toys , trinkets , knickknacks , little presents , flowers , and candies , things that can really influence an impressionable young person .
Fast !
Don't be afraid .
What ?
He's already done so .
What about it ?
Oh , what a wonderful son , I can impress my mother !
Look , you've got his wrinkled hands .
Hear me out , my lord .
Get up , get up , and look at this image of doomsday !
Horatio , you're the best man I've ever known .
Mankind's role is to fear and tremble when the almighty gods send warning signals .
Who's coming ?
Has Banquo left the court ?
That's what you get for marrying Christian husbands .
For some reason he's in prison now on some legal technicality , on Malvolio's orders .
Doesn't that rising blush suggest that she is virtuous and innocent ?
May heaven bless you .
And yet I wouldn't want to be you , uncle .
Well , I think that even if it weren't on record , the truth would be remembered from one generation to the next , all the way to Doomsday .
Your cheeks are thin because of hunger .
The sky shows countless stars .
So I won't give or risk anything for lead .
But everything that lives is mortal , including the foolishness of love .
I don't remember .
Do you need my help ?
Good !
At dinner .
Tell me , why did the king arrive with such a small entourage ?
Very well , my supreme lord , that's what I have to call you now .
Yes , I'll go .
What are you doing ?
Listen to our horses neighing , longing to be working .
What do you get to drink , instead of sweet obedience , but poisonous flattery ?
Was that the Caius Cassius that I knew ?
Are you playing tricks on me by showing me savages and uncivilized men from the Indies , ha ?
I am no villain .
Let me stand here until you remember your reason .
Good morning , gentlemen .
If only I could spit poison .
The king won't live , I hope .
He ran this way and jumped over this orchard wall .
Having already thought about the fact that she would have to die sometime , I can endure her death now .
Ah , my lord , this prince is nothing like Edward !
This is Caesar you're looking at .
Damn it all to hell !
It's something , it's nothing : it's yours , it's mine , and it'll belong to thousands more .
Yes , it's true .
The next day we had our fight at sea , and you know what happened after that .
I'm divided between two friends who are determined to kill each other .
A Roman .
I bet my life some evil busybody , some meddling , lying jerk made up this rumor to get some position .
Where are you going ?
Are you going to Scone ?
That's a good point .
The next person to strike again dies .
Because he's daring us to do it .
The reasons for his death are recorded in the Capitol .
I laugh at any weapon used by a man who was born from a woman .
Your bedroom .
No , and I didn't hear anything either , or suspect anything at all .
Speak .
honor you .
And the Prince and Claudio , who accused her , are innocent as well , because they were deceived by Don John .
Good luck , sir .
Yes , my lord , I played the part of a gossip and brought him the news .
Or if you follow me , you'd better understand that I'll do something bad to you in the forest .
No more than that , my lord .
Ah , dear , if that is true , let heaven make poisonous hail grow from my heart , and let the first hailstone drop down my throat .
And listen !
I'm not sure about that .
I loved this man so much it makes me weep .
I love him even when he's harsh and mean , Help me unpin this , would you ? , I love even his stubbornness , his frowns , his bad moods .
He couldn't eat without me talking about it .
Then hurry up and tell me what you want .
Come on , brother !
I'll yield my legions and cavalry to Caesar .
Over your wounds , which , like speechless mouths , open their red lips , as though to beg me to speak , I predict that a curse will fall upon the bodies of men .
The foul plan backfired on me .
We've been betrayed !
Everything may still be all right .
Orsino .
The only reason they don't get punished and cured is that the disease is so commonplace that the nuthouse nurses are usually suffering from it , too .
Then there's the Count Palatine .
I got him to leave , and made up an excuse for your trance .
You think you can get rid of me that easily ?
It was a total fluke that you yourself were saved .
No , I'm sure it has , Volumnius .
Here comes Lorenzo .
I would whip a guy for making a tyrant sound too tyrannical .
Ah , there's the problem .
A god of a god ?
Where is his body , Messala ?
Is he married to Cleopatra ?
Though I have far more reason , I don't have as much energy to curse you .
Go to sleep , and I will wrap my arms around you .
In that case I wish you were as good a man as a fish seller .
Give me one good reason to think she's cheating on me .
But first I'll release the fairy queen from the spell .
Sir , I have no future ahead of me .
If I come back from the battlefield again to kiss those lips , I'll be covered in blood .
Is he there in person ?
This ring , sir , oh no , it's nothing .
Oh God of battles , bolster my soldiers ' courage .
To get my poor , mad husband out from inside there .
Please , educate me .
No , you won't get a word out of me .
Why , sweetheart ?
I'll follow it .
I'll be obedient and do all my tasks without complaining .
Whether you are sad or merry , the intensity of either suits you like no one else.. .
If he looks serious , he must need money .
Why would she write to Edmund ?
Explain .
But what about the bloody handkerchief ?
Let those who would mar this fair land's peace with treason die before they can enjoy its wealth .
Weren't you ordered , on penalty of , Why Dover ? , Let him answer that question first .
Your statue spouting blood through many holes , in which many smiling Romans bathed , means that you'll provide great Rome with sustaining blood , and that great men will strive to get some token of approval from your holy blood .
Oh , yes I am , father .
I haven't slept since Cassius first began to turn me against Caesar .
You know , you're right .
I am unfit to rule and to be king .
Caesar hanged him for this service .
Oh , dear husband , don't believe everything you hear , or if you must believe it , don't let it all make you angry .
All right then , back home we go .
Are you dreaming or awake ?
Some to Ligarius's .
I'm coming .
If I see anything tonight that convinces me not to marry her , I'll shame her tomorrow in the very congregation where I would have married her .
But it is his handwriting ?
And from now on , when you get hot with me , I'll assume it's your mother speaking and leave it at that .
Go get Aliena ready , because , look , here comes my Rosalind .
But let's follow it , and then do our dirty work afterward .
Soldiers , sir .
You attract me to you , you cruel magnet !
Caesar himself is in trouble and there are more adversaries than we expected .
A night isn't much time for addressing matters of this importance .
Pick me up .
Do that .
I hear a voice more piercing than the music of these trumpets calling "Caesar ! " Speak .
That won't work , since I'm still reaping the rewards of that murder : my crown and my queen .
Come with me and let me advise you .
Has it been a quiet night ?
Romeo's a dishcloth compared to him .
Prepare the body , then , and follow us .
Come on .
My bones want to rest after helping me up to this hour .
I nursed her daughter , whom you were just talking to .
Or just a foretaste of it ?
Is Cassius nearby ?
You're not one of Pinch's patients , are you , sir ?
Be quiet , for shame !
Hurry !
That's strange .
And isn't your husband an honorable man ?
Get her attention and draw her home with music .
If you who are so wise can't help , please be kind enough to call my solution wise .
Were his wounds on his front side ?
Madam , you've given me life and given me a living too .
Here , at your service .
Tie him to this chair. , You'll see , criminal , By the gods , it's disgraceful for you to pull my beard .
I'm sorry you don't have time. , Antonio , give this gentleman a reward .
Or did the letter make him emotional somehow , and this is the first time he's done it ?
Yes , as much pleasure as one might take in choking a bird at knifepoint .
What foreign lands has he conquered and captive foreigners chained to his chariot wheels ?
I'll go back to the duke of Gloucester and tell him so .
The gods forbid !
I will go out .
Yes , very well .
My dear , let's go inside and wait for them to arrive .
You're right .
Are you sure of that ?
Ask your husband if you doubt me .
You're leaving with my tongue in your tail ?
You armor my heart .
Lock him in , so he can play the fool in his own home only .
But for whose sake did I do that sick deed ?
Well , Brutus , you're noble .
I regret my crime more than my death , and I beg your Highness to forgive me , while punishing my body with death .
But don't you see what a Did you hear someone ?
And he challenged you to a duel ?
Conspiracies , fakery , betrayal , and disorder are all that's left until we die .
I'll give you cramps for saying that , horrible pains in your sides that will keep you from breathing .
Then it must be Banquo's .
Go away and stay apart from me .
We'll never see each other again .
Let's get away , Tybalt .
What are you , girl ?
I'm an ass , I'm a woman's servant , and I'm beside myself .
They were villains , murderers .
Go on , master , and I will follow you , with truth and loyalty to my last breath .
Is the king awake , worthy thane ?
How is my generous sister ?
Right on cue , here's the duke himself .
You're not being a good friend , Iago , if you even Please don't ask me to tell you .
Where are you , Death ?
Who are you , slave ?
Go in , or we're done for .
Why , because we're always handling our ewes , and their fleece , as you know , is greasy .
Here on her breast there's a little bloody mark .
It's nine o'clock !
Is that possible ?
Is he sane ?
Show him in .
It's not my fault he acts like that , Helena .
I'm just wandering , with no particular destination .
With this marriage , all the petty jealousies that now seem huge , and all the great fears that are dangerous in themselves , would disappear .
It persuades you and discourages you .
But do this : find your brother , wherever he is .
But if you'd be willing to shoot another arrow the same way you shot the first , I'll watch your arrow more carefully this time .
Do you hear us , sir ?
But listen , Charmian .
The more she
My dear sir !
Yes , he's the one who first told me about her .
And the boys are winning so far ?
You've wronged Caius Ligarius .
Death and damnation !
I've told you I'm your friend , and I'll stick by you .
And I'll be eternally grateful to you .
That's where hell is , and darkness , and fires and stench !
Though the truth of your treachery is as plain as black on white , I can scarcely believe it , it's so past understanding .
I don't know what you've done to upset him , but someone has challenged you to a duel .
Those uncles that you wish were here were dangerous .
Can a person be forgiven and still keep the fruits of his crime ?
You are to bring his daughter to the supper .
The last thing he did before sending me off , dear Queen , was to kiss , the last of many such kisses , this Indian pearl for you .
Don't misunderstand me , sir .
You see how naive and foolish I've been .
No man must know." What if this someone were you , Malvolio ?
As the sonnet says , "If you please one special person , you please everyone who matters." Why , what's going on ?
All those memories pain his mind so deeply that guilt and shame keep him away from Cordelia .
Be silent , or else my magic spell will be broken .
When devils are about to commit their biggest sins they put on their most heavenly faces , just like I'm doing now .
No man must know." What comes after that ?
My thoughts were never on money .
You're sure the handwriting is your brother's ?
Weren't you banished on pain of death ?
I'm telling you , just watch his face .
A murderer should look like you do , so pale and grim .
And is it healthy to walk uncovered and breathe in the dampness of the morning ?
I'm not interested in being good .
Is he alone ?
If you leave me like this , you're doing me wrong .
I often wander around in the woods like a forest ranger until the sun rises in the fiery red sky over the ocean , turning the salty green water to gold .
He won't have a chance .
And then again , it's not so good , but only so-so .
Strategy makes a better soldier than haste .
Here comes his Majesty .
Who pleaded with me to pardon
No , don't throw any of it away .
She's crying .
Give me the gown .
Adultery ?
Just listen this once .
Oh , listen to me , night , Who is this ?
What an awful day !
You're serious enough to know not to play games with Satan .
I curse myself for doing that !
Oh , Iras , Charmian !
I heard that Apollodorus carried , What did he carry , please ?
Oh , will it never be day ?
Isn't this war against me ?
We failed in half of our mission .
My Lord High Constable , the English lie within fifteen hundred paces of your tents .
Then I have offended no one .
We don't have any music that can't be heard .
And in public too .
Come here , Ariel .
The Prince and Claudio are hurrying this way .
Good-bye to you , the last of all the Romans .
Will you break my heart ?
Let me see your eyes .
Let's see how .
My fears can't actually make you evil .
Are you squinting at me ?
Say what you're here for .
Who do you obey here ?
At least tell me where you're going .
Madam , good night .
I'll be no king of England if I'm not also king of France .
You're a funny man , sir .
Good idea .
Sir , it's shaped like itself and is as wide as it has width .
Aren't the mayor and his fellow citizens coming ?
So why did you laugh when I said that men don't interest me ?
I wish my horse moved as fast as your mouth and was as tireless .
Goodbye , my lord .
So you'll be hanged at the state's expense .
I suspect that I have committed some offence to the city and you have come to reprimand me for not knowing better .
I don't think you would .
An important droplet is hanging from the corner of the moon .
And after that he came back here looking so serious ?
The king's a dear boy with a heart of gold , he's a lively lad , a wag , born of fine parents , good with his fists .
One ?
But why should my reputation for honor last longer than my honor did ?
He'd really be your proxy if he married you .
They say they have letters for you .
I'm not a traitor , unfair lady .
Sir Thomas Erpingham .
But this is a sure thing : the snake's an odd snake .
He'll kill me with tortures .
If we walk on the well-worn paths , they won't get caught in our petticoats .
Put out the light of the candle , and then put out the light of her heart .
Proculeius , Caesar has heard about what you've done here and has sent for you .
Welcome , lady .
Keep your money .
My name's Roderigo .
There's nothing to get upset about .
And as king I'll love you forever .
Tell her that I've been arrested and the money will be my bail .
God save your Majesty .
Nine or ten times I wanted to stab him under the ribs .
In Sicyon .
I think they want him to go home and appoint Cassio governor in his place .
Well , then he must be alive .
His position is hopeless .
The tragic actors from the city , the ones you used to enjoy so much .
Oh !
That's Cassio's voice .
It was wild insanity to believe promises made by the mouth and not the heart .
Who's his lieutenant , do you know ?
You're poisoning my eyes .
Nice and short and full of good sense , or should I say nonsense ?
Don't be crass. , You all look confused .
Well , my friends praise me and make me look like an idiot , while my enemies tell me straightforwardly that I am an idiot .
Farewell , old man .
Indeed , my lord , the gloomy Jaques grieves over these deaths .
I surrender your dukedom and beg you to forgive me all my crimes .
A snail ?
She knew an old song called "Willow" that reminded her of her own story , and she died singing it .
Yes , my lady .
Sir , sir , sir ,
The Egyptian flagship , the Gods and goddesses , the whole congregation of them !
She will be pleased .
Clearly , men should not go out walking too late !
This is what happens when you act rashly .
I will not confess it to you nor to anyone else , because there was no one else to witness her speech .
It wants us to speak to it .
I'd be as right for the job as you are , and I'd do it more easily , since I'd have good will on my side .
I'd rather kill myself .
Fine ! " he says .
I'm afraid you've sold your own land to see other men's .
It was a painful bruise , and she was crying bitterly .
What kind of help do you need ?
Oh , yes , I'm sorry , uncle. , If you'll excuse me , your grace .
Bless your five senses !
Caesar and he are better friends than ever .
This letter is for you from Signor Antonio .
I mean , with my head in your lap ?
Yes , sir .
Run to the Capitol and nothing else ?
Said what , sir ?
God bless you , sir .
Give him this money and these letters , Reynaldo .
I'm going , I'm going .
Well , thank you .
That's all there is to say .
Give them hefty meals of beef and iron and steel , and they will eat like wolves and fight like devils .
We chase everything in life more excitedly than we actually enjoy it when we get it .
Would you care to hear some music ?
What is your news ?
Brutus , my country's friend .
Go escort the lords of France and Burgundy , Gloucester .
Why , that's my dainty Ariel singing now .
Good Ursula , go wake my cousin and ask her to get up .
It's true that my brother's daughter is Queen of Tunis , and heir of Naples .
I didn't see them .
I could make the same boast even if I had a pig as my mistress .
Not a word .
Yes , my lord , quite well .
They burn for revenge .
But those political considerations might last such a long time that the general will forget my love and service , especially if I'm gone and someone else has my job .
It's easy to err when left to our own devices , but criticism helps us to see our faults and correct them .
Now be quiet .
There go the minstrels .
I took their stings too , wouldn't you say ?
Come on , another stanza , is that what you call 'em , "stanzas" ?
Night is approaching .
Yes , my lord , but I can spoil it .
Don't speak any further .
Now this joke has turned serious .
Not me .
I'll find your servant , and he'll update you now and then on your case as it stands here .
These kneelings and humble courtesies might excite ordinary men , flattering them into turning Roman law into children's games .
No , it doesn't mean anything .
He's arrived .
Signior Balthasar , you look upset .
The sound is going away .
Where's the Master ?
Take me to the edge of it , and I'll reward all your troubles with something valuable .
I have a daughter ( I have her until she gets married ) who's given me this letter , considering it her duty .
Why ?
Phoebe , keep your promise to marry me , and to marry this shepherd if you choose to refuse me .
Burn !
But that's not how you're going to be .
Goodbye .
What's the matter ?
Well then , goodbye .
He'll go back to his Egyptian dish .
This treachery of yours is like the second
I never saw Cassio's kisses on her lips .
Come , then , and send his body to Thasos .
Then Octavia's complaints will rouse Caesar , and as I said before , the thing that brought them together will part them .
Who's going to keep me from them ?
But you're still complaining of darkness and a bad view ?
These young children cry for Clarence and so do I , though they don't cry for Edward , as I do .
Nothing else , for God's sake !
He's welcome too .
What is it , Laertes ?
I've got you now , pagan .
Antony will go where his passion is .
Oh Buckingham , now I'm going to test to see if you're truly made of gold .
Not if you want to keep your arms !
Good evening , good evening .
Reluctantly , I agreed-alas !
You have bested many things , well don't try and best me .
You wrong me in every way .
Why , what did he do ?
I flashed about faster than lightning .
Get out !
Your Majesty didn't present yourself as the king .
Is there a scale here to weigh the flesh ?
And thus I let you go and give you to the gods .
Do that , my friend .
You pale face !
By Jove that thunders !
Yours , Claudio , yours , I say .
You could've done this without your beard and gown .
You couldn't find a third like these two unless the devil himself turned into a Jew .
There , take it , and thanks for taking such good care of me .
Take Cupid's wings and fly higher than the average man .
Don't talk back to me .
Look in on me , and talk with me , or I'll attack even without a weapon .
That's true , my lord : I did get this ring from her .
If they have spoken the truth about Hero , I will tear her apart with my bare hands .
Before I open this letter , please tell me how my good friend is doing .
You know too much about suffering .
What should I swear by ?
What's the boy Malcolm ?
Little" again ?
I'd rather lie in the Nile mud with flies laying their eggs in me , making me disgusting .
Would you try to lift Mount Olympus ?
Who's this Adam you speak of ?
Yes , indeed they are .
I'm no ordinary fairy .
Macbeth has heard this news and he is so angry that he's preparing for war .
If she were so moral , she would never have fallen in love with the Moor in the first place .
If you let her go this easily , Sir Andrew , you don't deserve to ever use your sword again .
When I've revealed my true identity , you'll be glad you took the time to help me out .
My own house , good lady .
Aren't you Lady Olivia's fool ?
You who are wicked beyond belief , the only "explanation" I'll accept from you is for you to hang yourself .
By Jupiter , if I were Antony , I wouldn't shave my beard today .
Be quiet , people !
Hold on a moment , and listen to my advice .
Oh , the poor man !
If I let him go , I'll have to pay his bail fees myself .
That will never happen .
Oh Lorenzo , if you keep your promise to me , I'll end this agony by becoming a Christian and marrying you .
I'm growing a beard .
Undress the statues if they're decorated in honor of Caesar .
When storms arrive early , you can expect the harvest will be damaged .
Order supplies for your trip and choose your traveling companions .
Iago , who started it ?
I will .
You certainly made me believe you did , my lord .
If I die before you do make sure I'm wrapped in those sheets in my coffin .
What if she won't kiss me ?
This paper tells me of ten thousand Frenchmen who lie dead on the battlefield .
You call this sneering ?
Come , let's have an early dinner so that we have time to work out our plans .
You couldn't beat the two of them apart .
Over there , where Titinius mourns it .
Only the adulterous and abominable Antony abandons you , giving his power to a whore who turns that power against us .
Killing men in the dark ?
If Cleopatra hears even a breath of this , she'll die immediately .
Ride to Salisbury .
Let's go !
As for us , you know we are Antony's , and he is Caesar's .
You think he's special , since you've only ever seen him and Caliban .
Do I speak to you kindly ?
Because it doesn't have eight ?
I can tell by his voice that this man is a Montague .
I certainly did , and I never wanted to see you again .
Give me your hand , sir .
Come on , Sir Andrew .
Who are you ?
Oh Cassio , Cassio , Cassio !
What can you see out on the ocean ?
I swear I thought you meant you'd been hurt physically .
She can't stand to hear about getting a husband .
You stupid cop , stop your violence !
I'll torture him .
Well , that proves she's in love with you .
Is this the cure for my aching bones ?
Please go , sir .
If you send them word that you won't come , they might change their minds .
It usually only lasts about twenty seconds .
He's an important person .
Pain , yes indeed .
In fact , the real nightmare had only just begun .
What should I say ?
I wish she'd never let you come .
Are you ready , sir ?
Sir , the laws of Ephesus will be on my side , and you'll be embarrassed .
Are you begging , brother ?
Oh , Kate , prudish customs bow before great kings .
Exactly , madam , until I sleep with you .
As soon as you kill Prospero .
Even though it's early , there are already a thousand armored soldiers waiting for you at the harbor .
The whole quarrel might have been resolved since then when we repaid what we stole from them , which most of our city did , for the sake of friendly trade relations .
Oh , here comes the storm again .
I swear on my honor that we saw and heard Hero talking to a brute at her window last night .
Oh , I wish we could unmask scoundrels like that , and give a whip to every good man to beat them senseless with !
He says more in one minute than he does in a whole month .
You were tricked into fighting , Gloucester .
Run , master , run .
What a wonderful time to be alive !
He's out of his right mind .
Actually , I should .
Our friends are all waiting for you .
Give me one , " I said .
It's Richard who sent us here to slaughter you .
What , have you forgotten me ?
Tomorrow night , when the moon shines on the water and decorates the grass with tiny beads of pearly light ( the time of night that always hides runaway lovers ) , we plan to sneak out of Athens .
That's true .
She's a lot like you .
Merciful God !
I almost recognize that voice .
You should be able to endure this because the world is broad and wide .
I'll scratch out your eyes , even if they could fly .
I'm reluctant to tell you what I wish you knew .
Let's carve him up like a dish fit for the gods , not chop him up like a carcass fit for dogs .
But here's a paper with Caesar's seal on it .
The one who makes her queen , of course .
Yes , right away .
The British troops are coming near .
I bet it will .
I can hear the lark singing .
I won't have any of this .
Don't be quick to pick a fight , but once you're in one , hold your own .
That blind head of yours was created to make me rich .
Damn you , don't mock and sneer at me .
Have you forgotten the horrid witch Sycorax , stooped over with old age and ill will ?
That's exactly what I'll do , my love , and I hope you'll do the same .
By our beards ( if we had them ) , you are a knave .
I can only say this about her : if she looked different than she does , she would be ugly , and since she can't be anything but herself , I don't like her .
I don't know .
But don't be too tame , either , let your good sense guide you .
If this isn't what you've been hoping for , I have no more to say except that you ought to say goodbye to Bianca forever .
Yes , madam , he lies beyond my reach .
If the world were mine , I'd give it all up , everything except Demetrius , to be you .
Give me some ink and paper .
But not the woman who scolds , anyway , I hope .
Listen !
I explained how you were deceived , how you were thwarted , the things that were used against you , who was working against you , and a lot of other things that would convince even a half-wit or a crazy person to say , "Banquo did it ! " You explained it all .
Only Antony was at fault .
Come here , man .
What's going on here ?
What's wrong , Hecate ?
If it's that important , then let the women die .
But this is bad !
Evil can come from good , just as poisonous snakes tend to come out into the open on bright sunny days , which means we have to walk carefully .
Let me go .
Speak one rhyme , and I'll be satisfied .
That must be because you're so ambitious .
Madam , an eagle does not have eyes as green , as quick , and as fair as the eyes of Paris .
If it's sad to see a handsome man with a cheating wife , it's a tragedy to see an ugly thug with a wife who's faithful .
What am I , a cane ?
Yes , and that's a serious failing .
All the perfumes of Arabia couldn't make my little hand smell better .
Come here , Catesby .
I'd hate to see you drowned in honey , sir .
There have never been orphans who've suffered what we have .
Look : Benedick is so pale , are you sick , or angry ?
Oh , my lord !
Now I have to go find some dewdrops and hang a pearl earring on every cowslip flower .
I'm my own spokesman .
You are their heir and sit on their throne , and the blood and courage that glorified them run in your veins .
Speak softly .
Take your cues from my own despair .
He couldn't be a lion if the Romans weren't such easy prey .
Fulvia's death and the pressing concerns related to it are not the only reasons I am eager to go ; friends in Rome have also sent many letters advising my return .
That's enough for me , then .
And yet , words are a good thing when the man speaking them is pleasant to listen to .
And what oath do we need other than that we honest men have told each other that this will happen or we will die trying ?
He'll accompany my wife , and bring whatever else you think I might need .
Now I am sure that eyes can't hurt a person .
You would fight with a man if he had one more whisker or one less whisker in his beard than you have in your beard .
We don't need to hear it .
Look , let's stay here tonight .
The gown was made just as my master was directed .
Come on , put it away .
My brother's servants used to be my equals .
Hear everyone's opinion , but reserve your judgment .
This is healthy talk .
You won't be wasting your time , because I really can sing and talk to him about many different kinds of music , so he'll be happy to have me in his service .
Oh , sir , impetuous people learn their lessons from the consequences of their foolish actions .
He's bound to Octavia .
You may as well undertake to be hanged .
No , sit down .
What's the obvious conclusion from that ?
Give me your hand .
I would've given it to you this morning , but a madman's letters aren't Gospel , so it doesn't matter much if I'm a bit late .
Yes , by God , that it is .
Honestly , no .
Go .
What do you say , Caesar ?
Regarding the Dauphin , you can speak to me .
But where will I lie tomorrow ?
Honestly , sir , I'd need to use words to explain why , and since words are so unreliable and false , I'd rather avoid using them in a serious discussion .
Bring Desdemona here .
I'm in a rush .
She's ready to go , but she'll never return .
Quiet , I say .
The sorrow that I feel actually belongs to you , and the high life you enjoy actually belongs to me .
She was fickle and unfaithful , like water .
Don't worry , man , I won't try to escape .
What , do you think we're Turks or savages , instead of Christians ?
And yet she cheapens herself by turning her gaze on me , who cut her sweet prince's life short and made her a widow ?
Nothing that I know for sure , but a lot that I'm afraid might happen .
Just as you'd like to have your sins forgiven , Indulge me , forgive me , and set me free .
We had a little food and fresh water that a nobleman from Naples , Gonzalo , had given us out of the kindness of his heart .
What else ?
Before you can say "Come" and "Go , " And breathe twice , and shout "So , so ! " Each one of your servants will rush here ,
I know him well .
He who chooses me will get what he deserves." That's nicely put , because who's going to cheat luck and get more than he deserves ?
Look , here comes Cassio and my husband .
Isn't that enough ?
Take credit , God , for it is no one's doing but yours .
But will it be soon ?
And trust me , love , you look pale to me too .
The rest of the dead are princes , barons , lords , knights , squires , and gentlemen of birth and rank .
If you ever had a mother , come in quickly to Sir John .
I won't pretend to be the devil's porter anymore .
Is that really what you meant ?
Yes , my good lord .
Very soon , because you want it .
You should look like an innocent flower , but be like the snake that hides underneath the flower .
I am a villain .
And my poor He's fainted. , My lord , my lord !
Your majesty !
I found it in my room , and Iago just confessed that he put it there for his own purposes .
I'll tell you , Cassius , you yourself have been called greedy and been accused of giving your positions to undeserving men in exchange for gold .
Well , well , I don't care .
Where do you live , pretty young man ?
That's the point .
You worthless girl !
Treat me well .
You have enough holy feeling to advise me to "make peace with God , " but you're willing to go to war with God by murdering me ?
No , my lord , I didn't see anything .
Lord Babyface over there will meet me in a duel , and good luck to him then .
I'd give forty pounds to be safe at home right now .
What an excellent idea , he'll soak up the wine !
Let's go .
Don't you know that I'm a woman ?
If you killed Lysander while he was sleeping , then you're already up to your ankles in blood .
Back then , I called you "a poor , imitation queen , " a badly reproduced copy of what I was , a pretty prologue for the tragedy that was about to follow , a woman who was lifted high only to be hurled down to hell , a mother only teased with two beautiful children , who would soon die .
For what favor ?
Do you want to go see him ?
Yes , every inch a king .
And I'll use that piece of rope to welcome you with .
I can't do everything I want to , but I'll help you as well as I can .
The lady has died because of the false accusations of me and my master .
With all my heart , Phoebe .
She's the reason I'm here .
Depending on what we plant , weeds or lettuce , or one kind of herb rather than a variety , the garden will either be barren and useless , or rich and productive .
What do you mean by that ?
Oh Lord , who's that crying ?
Why are we talking about him like this ?
Leave them alone until he sets off home , and then follow him .
Why do you keep these talents behind a curtain ?
What is fated to happen must happen .
I'm in so much trouble with my niece that it wouldn't be safe to let this prank go to its conclusion .
Lay out the gown .
Then may your daughters be cursed with all the horrible fates that await sinners !
So come with me .
But don't kill my sister and her royal sons , be satisfied , dear God , with our blood , which is being spilled unjustly , as you know .
Well , your imprisonment won't last long .
Tell me , Fluellen : did you just come from the bridge ?
No drugs or sleeping pills will ever give you the restful sleep that you had last night .
I don't know what you and other men think of this life , but as for me , I'd rather not live at all than live to worship a man as ordinary as myself .
See how well she can turn ?
No , if I had power I would take world peace and throw it down to hell .
I could be convinced if I were like you .
My clerk has some comforting news for you , too .
Most noble Antony !
Sinful Macduff , they were killed because of you !
We'll be there , and there we'll rehearse courageously and wonderfully , truly obscenely .
Shame on you ; I've already run out of patience with you all .
I brought you here from Venice .
He can't bear his grief and so he's losing his mind .
They're murdering Caesar ! " Who's there ?
Yes , sir .
My man , monster is so drunk he can't talk .
What's going on , Malvolio ?
Why , madam , have I offered you my love only to be flouted in front of the king ?
The duke will be here tonight ?
But I say amen to everything she said .
Will you fight well ?
I never offended him at all .
And even if you throw everything you possess to the two of them , they'll battle each other to the death to have it all .
I'm not sure , but I don't think so .
Call the messenger in .
I have no opinion about him .
You're just playing around .
Do you know me ?
We have to strike while the iron's hot .
Why , Dromio ?
Gravestones have been known to move , and trees to speak , to bring guilty men to justice .
No ?
Give me some applause , if we're friends , and Robin will make everything up to you .
And you , And how are you liking the shepherd's life , Master Touchstone ?
Instead of crying , let's keep hold of our swords and defend our fallen homeland like honorable men .
I am not here to disprove what Brutus has said , but to say what I think there's a lot of sense in what he says .
The sky frowns and scowls on our army .
I'll take no lesser name than that of Something that refers to my current state .
Please hire Cassio again .
Well , I'll go hide the body in some hole until the duke gives orders for his burial .
I will , Caesar .
I brought my master news of Juliet's death .
If you want things done in the right way , you'll have to let me read a crazy letter in a crazy voice .
But why did you tempt the heavens like that ?
Come like shadows and depart in the same way !
The poor thing !
No , please good Meg , I'll wear this one .
I'm telling you , I hardly know myself .
I'm sure I can answer for him , he doesn't know any , either .
Tomorrow , I'll let you know what I've decided and what answer you should deliver to the king of England .
Is he right ?
No , you won't die yourself , but only by proxy .
She'll have to have it .
By the Lord who raised me to this weighty post from the happy and carefree life I used to enjoy , I promise you I never did anything to get the king to turn against the duke of Clarence .
Oh , that's nonsense !
Yes , she saw me quite clearly .
Orsino .
In this recent storm .
My niece Olivia will notice , and let me tell you , no matchmaker in the world can get you a woman faster than a reputation for courage .
Is she dead , then ?
I hate it and want all good men's love .
No , I'll prove it with airtight evidence and logical argument .
Do as I tell you .
Hurry , go up to the roof .
Well , then , that's how it is .
Give me the necklace !
And smelled like that , too ?
What does that mean , sir ?
To hell with you !
His military ability is double that of the other two .
Well , Juliet , I'll lie with you tonight .
By this sword , I will .
Your voice is loud and commanding , but you look like a working man .
Where is Malvolio ?
A gentleman ?
Let's carry him in triumph to his house !
Do you hear that , Charmian ?
I mean a husband .
They're lying over there , and the poor old man , their father , weeps so piteously over them that the whole audience has joined him in grieving .
And you can't deny evidence and argument , They've been around since Noah's ark .
Madam , I will .
I've got some business to take care of .
Say it again , just one word , and my hand , which killed your lover out of love , will kill your far truer lover .
I believe you , and I ask you to forgive me .
Here .
Girls younger than she often marry and become happy mothers .
Oh , Tranio , what a cruel father he is .
Is the worst well ?
I hear that you must marry this count on Thursday , and that nothing can delay it .
Yes , Desdemona .
Have you ever heard of anything like that , Roderigo ?
If not , then this parting was well done .
Get up , man !
I won't be gone long .
It's time for me to say goodbye to you .
Do you want to hear it again ?
But stop , I say .
No more of this .
Eros , can you still see me ?
Yes , that's the one .
Aren't they at this very moment on the western shore helping the rebels land safely from their ships ?
Oh , you prophesied that the time would come when I would want your help in cursing that humpbacked spider , that hideous toad !
Whichever hand literally stabbed their tender hearts , you're the one who gave the order .
All these aging faculties tell me , and I can not be wrong , that you are my son , Antipholus .
Time will tell what you've got up your sleeve .
You can't tell a story simply when it's a lie .
Let me embrace the father of Lucentio , and then we'll journey on to see your son , who will rejoice at your arrival .
I'll frown at them as they pass by , and they can react however they want .
I'm the man who was born to tame you and change you from a wildcat Kate into a Kate as gentle and domestic as other household Kates .
And it's definitely better to cry because you're happy than laugh because you're sad !
My lord , he wonders why you have assembled such troops of citizens to speak with him , since he had no idea they were coming .
If Echo were as fast , he would be worth a dozen like Belman .
Go up there and second his petition .
Cut yourself ?
Charmian !
Like her ?
I'm not going to waste any more time with you .
I don't know what you're talking about .
You have absolutely abused our sex in this love talk of yours .
Sweet men , come to him .
I can't get that song out of my head tonight .
Oh , you devil , you devil !
I wish I knew what was in your heart .
Any minute .
Portia , goodbye to you .
I intend to be flesh and blood , not airy philosophy , for there has never yet been a philosopher who could endure a toothache patiently , even though they all write as if they had risen above human suffering and misfortune .
Do you dare kill a friend of mine ?
Should I do it now ?
If you really feel that way , then I hope you won't kill me .
Are you trying to make fun of me ?
Please answer , my good little student .
to have a stupid wife .
Now Antony has to leave her completely .
What are you reading , teacher ?
About as long as it would take someone to count slowly to a hundred .
You're not answering my question .
I have no gift for the one and no strength for the other , though I have the gift of strength .
But not for long ; Charles will take care of everything .
We were somewhere where I couldn't pick a fight with him , but I've decided to wear it in my cap until I see him again , whereupon I'll give him a little piece of my mind .
Many thanks , Signior Gremio .
If that's all , gentlemen , I see no problem .
She was lying even as she was going down to hell .
His imagination is making him crazy .
Hold the friar too .
The good manners of the court look as silly in the country as country behavior is laughable at the court .
Your grace , please forgive me .
Look , and you'll see .
What are you going to tell her , Nurse ?
Let it go up to heaven .
If that's what you want , all right .
I mean what I say .
We grew together like twin cherries , which seemed to be separate but were also together , two lovely cherries on one stem .
If I decide to get angry at you , just watch out , You'd be done for then , monster .
That "may be" must be , love , on Thursday .
Run , everyone , run !
Isn't today the day when Hermia has to tell us her decision about whether she'll marry Demetrius ?
Your mother's been poisoned .
By the god Jupiter above , I swear "No." By Jupiter's wife Juno , I swear "Yes." They wouldn't dare .
The candle is burning in your study , sir .
With a needle and thread .
Thank you kindly , sir .
Sport ?
The king acts unnaturally , father against child .
My love , my life , my soul , beautiful Helena !
If he's nearby , I want an explanation .
My dear lady , Please let me say something , I'm begging you .
Now please , tell Beatrice to come out .
So can I .
I hate no-good drunks .
Oh , you bloody prison , fatal and threatening to noble lords !
Father , could I please ask you to tell these people what happened between me and this young man ?
Whatever you see first when you wake up , think of it as your true love .
My liege , this man is a villain and a traitor , who , see , your Grace , has struck the glove which your Majesty took from Alencon's helmet .
We are , my lord .
For Hecuba !
Enjoy your frankness ; it suits you .
This is the jester I have met so many times in the forest .
I've seen the whole thing , and it's completely worthless , unless you think their bad acting and their misremembered lines , which they memorized so painfully , are funny .
Then we'll call this the Battle of Agincourt , fought on the day of Crispin Crispianus .
If you lie , boy , we'll have you whipped .
If people take what he says , fine .
When the actors were talking about poison ?
She's so good at sewing , and a wonderful musician .
Let me go with you .
You've shut me up in a dark room and given your drunken cousin authority over me , but I'm as sane as you are .
But let it go. , Now , Litio , it's your turn .
Kent , father , sisters !
Good job , my little one .
Are you kidding ?
If she welcomes him and his hundred knights after I've shown how inappropriately he's behaved , Here , ma'am .
What , in our own house ?
Terrible .
The count's messenger , Cesario .
I swear I will , and if I ever break my promise let me turn into a monster .
Go away , now .
And it's too bad that the Moor chose a man with such a deep-rooted drinking problem as his second-in-command .
Let's move .
I'd rather give myself up to the hatred of a violent brother who refuses to recognize that we are brothers .
You just fell the height of ten ship masts , straight down .
It was urgent and important enough to require his personal presence .
How many months do you want ?
Oh , you're wrong .
Do you bring me a letter from the friar ?
I told him you were asleep .
Oh well , God's in charge , and some people have to go to heaven , while other people have to go to hell .
My first question for Nerissa is whether she'd rather wait till tomorrow night or go to bed now , since there are only two more hours till morning .
I'm not drunk .
Oh , come quickly !
Come on , sweet Audrey .
In God's name , I beg you not to wish for one more man .
Just watch !
You're making such a fuss .
Don't bother with it .
Can you tell me ?
Damned Iago !
I know the man well .
Is that true ?
Amen to that , lady .
Villains , you didn't do even that much when your vile daggers struck each other as they hacked up Caesar's sides .
What was the philosopher Pythagoras's belief about wild birds ?
She is in a better place .
Why are you asking me that ?
We'll have a couch made up that's softer and more fragrant even than the bed of lustful
Should we now dirty our fingers with lowly bribes and sell the mighty offices that we hold for whatever money we can get our hands on ?
Of course the Prince wants Hero for himself .
Come , everyone .
Get busy , go !
Has it come to this ?
You might as well try to stab the air with your sword .
Now all the late travellers are hurrying to reach their inns .
Goodbye .
We'll take you there .
Being too old to marry someone young .
And leave you out ?
Your authorization is ready .
And let no one suffer for this deed except us , the perpetrators .
Yes , quite a large one , with many cells and dungeons , Denmark being one of the worst .
I'm sure it is to knight you , Captain .
This treacherous Egyptian has betrayed me .
Indeed , sir , it is .
Let's see here .
How awful !
This land will belong to your and Albany's children forever. , And now what does my second daughter Regan , the wife of Cornwall , have to say ?
You wronged yourself to write on behalf of such a man .
Faster , Eros , faster .
But if it's not double-dealing , sir , I wish you'd deal me another .
I can not live without her .
I hear him mock Caesar's luck , which the gods give to men in order to balance out their subsequent wrath .
How do you mean , "conspired" ?
Whom you swore you would protect and defend .
This tyrant , whose mere name is so awful it hurts us to say it , was once considered an honest man .
And she's loyal , as she has proven .
And what about that ?
Nobody delivered it , my lord .
Now you know the reason for the rush .
I can't find it .
If you were my fool , uncle , I'd have you beaten for getting old before your time .
You're not going anywhere .
Your behavior is an insult to all women .
He pretended that everything was fine until the moment they were exchanging vows , and then , with public accusation , blatant slander , pure hatred , Oh God , if only I were a man !
If you're calling me Jephthah , my lord , I do have a daughter I love more than anything , yes .
I wish I had !
The morning is approaching .
These ones , then , will be assassinated .
And yet I do love you .
He was somewhere in the middle , between them.. .
Not being the worst daughter deserves some praise , I guess .
Well , then , here it is : you must prepare yourself for his knife .
Here I am , your slave , a poor , sick , weak , hated old man .
When he opens his wallet to give us our pay , your conscience will fly out ?
I can see you don't like this gentleman .
Was a man ever beaten as much as me ?
It's a good thing for you that , being castrated , you can better concentrate on my needs .
No , if they try to lead us to harm , I will leave the dance floor at the next song .
The empire may be in danger if he's not restrained before he reaches his full potential .
Is the snake better than the eel because the pattern on his back pleases the eye ?
In what chapter and verse of his heart ?
It would make him curse the heavens and be damned to hell .
Do so .
Give me an aphrodisiac , pharmacist .
We must not .
You'll soon be meeting Lorenzo at supper ; he'll be a guest of your new master .
I'm not such an idiot that I can't keep my hands dry .
No , it was just a dream .
Keep myself ?
What are they doing in the north when they should be in the west serving their king ?
This way , we can see how the world moves .
Ill will never prompted anything well said .
That's what makes it "sensitive" news .
Take good care of him .
Cheers , boys .
Ever since Venus and her blind son plotted a way for the god of the underworld to steal my daughter away for half the year , I swore I'd never speak to them again .
On my honor , I swear I love Rivers with all my heart .
That's me .
This guy doesn't pay much attention to punctuation .
I am dying ! , My lord , you still have one eye left to see Cornwall punished .
Please , come with me .
Oh , let us be merciful anyway .
Do you agree that Ferdinand must have drowned ?
How are you , your highness ?
Yes , yes , my lord .
I tried to stop speaking plainly , since you dislike plain speech so much .
Really ?
I'd follow you to the gates of Hell , you sneaky little devil !
It's his handwriting , my lord , but I hope he didn't mean what he wrote .
Our master and mistress are looking for you .
In the meantime , come home with me , and when the time is right I'll take you to talk to him .
Oh , they say that dress surpasses all others .
Military music and military rites will speak for his heroic qualities .
Please , father , I beg you .
Ah , you sorceress !
When you weren't at home , the Senate sent out three different search parties to find you .
If he doesn't like it , he can go live with my sister .
Find out what this villainous Edgar is thinking , Edmund .
Who was it that came here ?
I'm not a fighter .
Where did they disappear to ?
But I bet Fortinbras will win the election to the Danish crown .
Be content .
And like I am for Rosalind .
Me too .
I'll leave you for now .
Pray God does some surgery on you : you need to be fixed .
How did my master die , Strato ?
God will revenge it .
I know that , sir .
I'll speak to them , and then tonight I'll get them all so drunk that the wine seeps out of their old war wounds .
When he comes back from hunting , I'm not going to speak to him .
What's the difference ?
Usually fathers produce children , not the other way around .
Peter Quince , What is it , jolly Bottom ?
I'll conjure him as if I were summoning a spirit .
No , Kate ?
Come out , beautiful sun , until I've bought a mirror to admire my reflection in , I'll watch my shadow as I stroll along .
Well , what's going on , mister ?
I was born to speak cleverly , not seriously .
You're lucky , my lord , to be able to see the peace and sweetness even in what bad luck has brought you .
I'll bet you a hundred marks , my Kate puts her flat on her back .
Now , by the world , It's full of your ugly wrongdoings .
You're going to make me jealous , Launcelot , if you keep taking my wife into dark corners like this !
Will you please make this half-devil say why he tricked me and damned my soul ?
But you don't love me .
Oh , sad day !
Madam , some actors happened to cross our paths on the way here .
You know that we parted only seven years ago , in Syracuse .
Do you have desires ?
Why would you celebrate it ?
Now , please , I beg you , don't work so hard .
Oh , are you here , Iago ?
I'm sweating and trembling with fear .
I assure you , sir , there's nothing to be afraid of .
Madam , I will .
My father wasn't a traitor .
He would have gotten a pension of six pence a day for his whole life .
There'd be no marriage ?
My letters say there are a hundred and seven ships .
Or should I describe you as the one who killed her brothers and her uncles ?
And the one who commands us is our king .
But it's no treason for an Englishman to cut off a French crown , a head , I mean , and tomorrow the king himself will do some snipping .
Yes , you already hurt me in the church , in the town , and in the fields .
What if I had a rat in my house , and I felt like paying ten thousand ducats to have it exterminated ?
I'm sorry I hit you .
These were sweet omens !
Their forces are nearby .
That's a wise idea .
Take away this lout and whip him .
What is it , Agrippa ?
What is your name ?
Well , we'll see how you act .
Oh , God !
I'm going to tell Desdemona my feelings .
And now , my friends , my courageous and educated friends , do me one small favor .
Tell me , how is my mother ?
How is my wife ?
The town is asking for a pause in the fighting for negotiation .
Oh my !
No , you have to call me Rosalind. , Sister , you're coming ?
With one cut you can be through paying money to Naples .
I've spent five years in the remotest parts of Greece and roaming all over Asia .
Tybalt is lying over there .
Please , my lord , call her back .
I say that I love you more than he does .
No one's heard from him .
Please do .
Othello's wife has a lot of influence now .
No , I won't .
Really , I'm afraid you are .
That's out of tune , sir .
When did I say all that ?
If I miss this , let me be boiled alive .
The Count Claudio will marry Leonato's daughter .
Where's Antony ?
And did you see the handkerchief ?
Just know this before I begin : I can't play a single note that's worthy of note .
Hey , Brabantio !
It's over here .
I was his daughter when your Highness took my father's dukedom .
Gloucester's eyes ?
Let me see her .
A drunkard or a corpse ?
What's going on , Dromio ?
Thank the lord for alliances !
Dolabella .
Hero is his only child , and his only heir .
Flee ?
And so you do .
Bandage my wounds !
And you won't until the needy eat .
When you record these sad events in your letters , please describe me exactly as I am .
What are you accused of ?
You've said what you have to say now .
It's clear that someone less noble , less loyal , more bloody-minded than Clarence but not a blood relation , deserves as bad an end as my brother , but he goes free .
Did you see the king today , Lord Derby ?
Yes , and paid me well for doing it .
Good night .
A man named Taurus , they say .
You didn't arrive like Caesar's sister .
Yours , if we're talking about I'm leaving .
Her father loved me and used to invite me to his house often , continually asking me about my life and all the battles I've fought .
So why aren't our eyelids heavy ?
Good morning , Benedick .
Sorry , sir ?
Now get on with your story .
Truly , no , no more than is reasonable .
Nobody's coming ?
What , are you going to mock me to my face when I told you not to ?
Just give me a moment , please , only a moment .
The four suitors are looking for you so they can say goodbye , madam .
My lord , this bill that's being proposed is the same one that was proposed in the eleventh year of old King Henry's reign .
This little prank of hers is going to cost me .
But no beautiful woman has an honest face .
They were nearly killing each other , as you saw when you pulled them apart .
Don't spend any more time here .
We're following you not only because it is our duty , but also because we want to .
Now , Brutus , you have only yourself to thank .
It eats and sleeps and has the same five senses we do .
If I didn't have a good reason to do this , damn me to the very bottom of hell .
But I'm not dying yet !
He will die .
Telling you where he's sleeping is like telling you where I'm lying .
But , go on .
This Iago is extremely honest and good , and he knows a lot about human behavior .
Give me Bianca for my inheritance .
So I'd like it copied .
We'll keep the lines of communication open between us .
Cesario , you missed your appointment with me .
I almost feel you .
Who are you , coming so fast in this quiet night ?
Yes , this is what love does .
You're sure full of smooth answers .
And why are you so pale ?
But tell me , how is your cousin ?
Say what you want , but I know what I know .
But I'll marry you under different circumstances , with extravagant festivals , public festivities , and celebration .
And as for his dreams , I'm surprised he's so foolish as to trust the fantasies of a restless night .
The tawny cat has meowed three times .
But we already swore , sir .
If she is , you can sue me for lying to you .
Tie him up harder. , You filthy traitor !
Certainly , your grandmother had a worse match .
I hope to God it's something political , like you think , and not jealousy involving you .
And he doesn't let go of his target when a distraction appears .
Tomorrow , Caesar , I'll be able to tell you what land and sea forces I can raise for this war .
We'll put a leash on this danger that's now running wild .
I gave him no order .
I didn't think you could even be so angry .
This is not the way to win your daughter .
I don't think it's a good idea .
That's right .
Places , everyone !
Look how they kiss and carry on !
What are you fighting about ?
Maybe he's not feeling well .
Why , what are you afraid of ?
We're sitting ducks for the French , if they only knew it , for there is no one guarding it but boys .
Yes , that was it .
Look here , this is the entrance to his room .
Get out of my sight ! , I guess if she doesn't love her father , then I'll only have peace when I'm dead. , Call the King of France .
I never saw the necklace , so help me heaven !
Go take care of him .
Why not ?
He's his mother's child from head to toe .
But , sir , Why should you do this , you want to know ?
My heart's too sad for long goodbyes .
Every subject's duty is the king's , but every subject's soul is his own .
She's very moral .
But I'm old now , and suffering has weakened me .
What else you do know ?
Look at this , here is the man , scarred , as you can see , by traitors .
Night is over , and day is coming .
That sound you heard was the It was the lark , the bird that sings at dawn , not the nightingale .
O , this evil wind that spreads nothing but misery .
Cheer up and be at peace .
Take off my mistress ' gown for your master's use !
He swore that he'd never get married , but now , despite his earlier protestations , he loves ungrudgingly .
Yes , sir , and I'll leave when you ask me to .
So to be banished from Verona is like being banished from the world , and being banished from the world is death .
Oh , how I wish we could oppose Caesar's spirit , his overblown ambition , and not hack up Caesar himself !
And yet , against all odds , I win her over !
Most noble Antony ! " Then , as she was speaking your name , a strangled groan split her words .
What I deserve is that you treat me like a queen , and what you deserve is to act like my subjects .
And you won't tell me who you are ?
Hello , mortal !
He who will not follow me now , let him depart and stand in the doorway like a pimp , cap in hand , while some slave , no nobler than my dog , violates his daughter .
Struggling with the wind and rain .
Caius Ligarius , I was never your enemy so much as the sickness that's made you so thin .
It's getting late .
That's good advice .
That ?
I'm sure some Christian will resort to trickery to get you .
Your wife and children were savagely slaughtered .
What can I say to him , lady ?
I'll keep my oath and patiently suffer through my anger .
I did not kill your husband .
Then you're a fool for being sad that your brother's soul is in heaven .
Day has broken .
Retreat !
But if it overwhelms you to look at Caesar's wounded cloak , how will you feel , kind men , now ?
Is that the latest we can do it ?
Take this mad wretch to jail. , Father-in-law Baptista , will you see that he's available to appear in court ?
Take it and do that for me , and leave me alone for a while .
I won't consider it .
Give me your hand .
Please , sir , restrain yourself .
Foolish girl , in the eyes of most people this man's a Caliban , and compared to him , they're angels .
As for his cowardliness , ask Fabian .
God in heaven bless her !
Sit down and eat , and welcome to our table .
Endless greed and lust in a man's nature is a kind of tyranny .
Oh , where's Romeo ?
Yes , I will .
Ever since you lost yours .
No , he just smiles .
People in high positions are shaken by many blasts of wind , and when they fall , they shatter into pieces .
Listen they're howling .
And so do I. I think we all do .
By this leek , I swear I'll make you pay for this .
Tell him I want to speak with him .
Let's give a fair verdict .
Did you send for him , sir ?
Let me live here forever .
Sir , we'll follow as soon as Mark Antony kisses Octavia good-bye .
Go ahead .
Look how the moon seems to be sleeping with its lover and can't be awoken !
All these friends are my witnesses , so I swear to you , I swear by your beautiful eyes , in which I see myself reflected , Did you hear that !
You always slip out of the argument like this .
No , Orlando , men are like April when they're wooing a girl , young , and passionate , but like December once they're married and their passions have cooled .
You can go straight to hell !
Just think , I could be Count Malvolio !
But oh , poor Glou-cester !
The brave experience death only once .
Perhaps What , my love ?
Romeo must die .
Stop , for God's sake !
Lieutenant , I think you know I'm your friend .
It's you we were laughing at .
Go hide , Adam , and you'll hear how he abuses me .
Or should we enter without apologizing ?
My beautiful queen , we'll go up the mountain and listen to the hounds as their barking echoes in the cliffs and sounds like music .
And when she speaks , doesn't her voice stir up passion ?
Do you think so ?
Richard , a fiendish spy for hell itself , still lives , but only long enough to buy souls to send below .
It's not yet daylight .
I'd do anything to bring them back together , since I really care for Cassio .
We'll meet again at nine in the morning .
I don't love Hermia ; I love Helena .
Go ahead .
So do you take her or leave her ?
Goodbye , nymph .
It is three o'clock , and , Romans , before night , we will try our luck in a second battle .
Look at this man .
And that's how she died ?
Damn it !
So please , my sweet Rose , my dear Rose , be happy .
You told me she got them , and that she promised to give me a little something in return soon , but nothing like that ever happens .
My deep trust in him made him deeply untrustworthy , arousing in him a treachery as big as my trust was , my trust which had no limit , an infinite confidence .
I wouldn't have missed this even for a pension of thousands of pounds , to be paid by the shah of Persia .
I'm not staying here to argue anymore .
Hasn't he proven himself to be a great villain , slandering , scorning , and dishonoring my cousin ?
So let me hear what you have to say .
He is .
But I have to remember that I'm here on Earth , where doing evil is often praised , and doing good is sometimes a stupid and dangerous mistake .
Who else should it be ?
Don't let us talk you into anything , but consider carefully the value of our offers .
Pardon me , but I'm just repeating what you yourself have said .
It's pretty .
Motley is the only thing to wear .
I will , my lord .
Only Adam , Rafe , and Gregory were ready .
Come , Kate , let's go to bed .
But I slip from underneath her and she falls down , crying , "Ow , my butt ! " and starts coughing , and then everyone laughs and has fun .
Add defiance to all this and , by way of conclusion , tell him that he has betrayed the men who follow him , whose death sentence has been pronounced." My king and master's message delivered , my task is done .
And what did Surrey say to that ?
Go back again , slave , and bring him home .
Sir , he told me quite bluntly that he didn't feel like it .
I told you , someone's at the gate .
Are you drunk ?
She creeps along .
We're off , Biondello .
Are you behind some bush ?
That's just how he is .
A loud-mouthed , drunken monster .
I look forward to that present .
Tell them to capture me , then sell my bones .
Where did we leave off ?
Come on , "nothing" will get you nothing .
Noble people don't answer to peasants !
I'm Christopher Sly , son of old Sly of Barton-on-Heath , a peddler by birth , a Oh , this is why your poor wife is mourning !
We'll hit him on the head with the handles of our swords , then throw him in the wine barrel in the next room .
We still have hope .
What was that cry for ?
Oh , how wonderful to see you !
Asses are made for bearing , and so are you .
From a certain knight who swore on his honor that the pancakes he was eating were good , and that the mustard on top of them , he swore on his honor , was bad .
Therefore , the fact that you're awake this early tells me you've been upset with some anxiety .
Do you remember anyone who died of it ?
Be quiet for a while. , Robin , take off his donkey head. , Titania , get the fairies to play some music , and make these five people sleep more soundly than humans have ever slept before .
I can imagine more than I can say , I have more on my mind than words .
Come on .
I mean , what do the words say ?
No , from the moon , I'm telling you .
May God be at your table .
Here comes the furious Tybalt back again .
Could you have found two Romans as good as these two ?
How can it be ?
Now that you speak of paper , I remember a funny story of Hero's .
No more , no more .
What , there's going to be a masquerade ?
My good lords , I plan to .
So I suppose your grace can truly say that I have lost it .
Silence , then !
I say it's the moon that shines so bright .
He did , and I gave it to him .
Shylock , they're offering you three times the money you lent .
As long as that ?
But you should hurry anyway .
Let him become Caesar !
So , in the name of God and all the good that will come of this
Where's the king ?
Here's the money you asked me to hold .
Tybalt is dead , and Romeo has been banished."
You just missed a fight that was barely avoided .
Heaven knows what secrets she's keeping .
No , Caesar doesn't have epilepsy .
The crown was offered to him three times ?
You'll be sick tomorrow because you've stayed up all night .
To the field !
The armies have merely changed places , Titinius , because Octavius has been overthrown by noble Brutus's forces at the very moment that Antony overthrew Cassius's legions .
I was a reasonable man , then I became a fool , and finally a beast !
You belong to her .
We should all kneel before her , men of Cyprus !
You know me well .
I'll do anything rather than marry a drunk , Nerissa .
Make Cassio angry somehow , either by speaking too loud , or insulting his military skills , or however else you want .
A greater gift ?
Who will advance with me ?
Here ,
Do you have news from Verona ! , What is it , Balthasar ?
Give me your hand , Leonato .
Yes .
Where's your sparkle now ?
Don't tone things down or exaggerate them out of hostility .
Don't push him too far .
I will find the time to cry for you , Cassius , I'll find the time .
Here .
I'll give you the title to that ship and its treasure .
He lost both , my lord. , Ma'am , this letter is from your sister , and needs an immediate answer .
I'll fix you , I swear .
He's a coward , a total coward .
You wouldn't know enough to be afraid of traps .
I'll be nice to him .
I'm not that stupid .
You weren't good enough for her .
But since you're his scoundrel servant , I will .
May the god of power make me , the weakest of the weak , your mediator .
Tell her to put her mind at rest .
It is .
Has my master returned yet ?
I've served you since childhood , but I've never done you a better service than telling you to stop .
But , my good lord , the words of you and Lord Buckingham are as trustworthy to me as if I had seen and heard him speak myself .
Apologize ?
Her curses have made my hair stand on end .
Good-bye .
There's no reason to be afraid .
I can not drink too much of Brutus's love .
I've worked it out .
Oh , lady , speak again .
Nobody ever set a gem like her in a worse setting than gold .
We'll go together , and before we've spent all the savings of your youth , we'll find a way to make a living .
My brother whom , aside from you , I loved more than anyone else in the world , I trusted to run my state , which at that time was the strongest in the land , and Prospero the number one duke , famous for my dignity and my education .
CALIBAN Stephano !
Why not ?
Go to your cabins and be quiet !
For God's sake , Sir Toby , you've got to come home earlier at night .
Both of which , master constable , You have .
Do so , and tell my sweet to be ready to scold me .
Have you sent anyone to Bottom's house ?
Caesar and Lepidus declared war against Pompey .
I know you're the right person for this job .
That's our offer .
Where are you from ?
Now that I'm done , Wall can go away .
Oh ho , oh ho !
Now Margaret's curse has fallen on our heads , for standing by and doing nothing when Richard stabbed her son .
But I just can't love him .
Just as tall as my heart .
Give me the vial .
Then teach your cousin to also be willing to close her eyes , my lord .
Quiet now !
Wake up , wake up , ring a bell and wake up all the snoring citizens .
What does your grace want ?
In his greatest need , even they will desert him .
This man said , sir , that Don John , the Prince's brother , was a villain .
Caesar's speed defies belief .
She says she thinks this is a prank .
You'll discover that his youthful follies were like the persona that Well , you're wrong , my Lord High Constable .
Oh God !
I'm Sir Rowland's middle son , and I bring you news .
They vanished strangely .
Hot , hot and moist .
I'll go too and make sure that happens .
You told me they escaped into this forest .
My strange self-delusions just come from inexperience .
You're a spirit , I know .
Nobody was hurt in the slightest .
He really was tricked horribly .
And how he loves Caesar !
But let me hear the letter from your friend .
We'll perform all the holy rites .
Cleopatra , Do you think there ever was , or could there ever be , a man such as the one I dreamed about ?
Shall I stay in this dreary world , which is no better than a pigsty without you ?
No matter what you say , my father is not dead .
So they think it's a good idea for you to watch a play and direct your thoughts toward laughter and merriment , two strong preventive medicines that foster long life .
He's really taken this prank to heart .
We have God and a good cause on our side .
That's why paintings of Cupid , the god of love , always show him as blind .
He brings great news .
But you're no such man .
Lead them inside .
God , what a burden on you I must have been !
Now , though , in all of Rome , there's room for only one man .
Come on and kiss me , Kate .
I hear his trumpet .
Nym , what you say is true .
Don't provoke them to battle until we have finished at sea .
Let's drink to our general !
That's right .
Arrest me if you dare .
I should sit in the corner and sing that song , "Heigh-Ho for a Husband ! " Lady Beatrice , I'll get you a husband .
We want to hear Caesar's will .
And so he fainted .
The wind that scatters young men throughout the world , encouraging them to seek their fortunes some place other than home , where there's little to be found in the way of experience .
I know it's the sun that shines so bright .
Who's calling ?
This is not a maiden , as you say , but an old man , wrinkled , faded , and withered .
Mark Antony , take Caesar's body .
Who sent you here ?
She said if she were interested in someone , it would be someone who looked like me .
Take three times your money .
I bet I've been wrong about myself all this time .
Oh , she's ten times nicer than her father is mean , and he's the height of crabbiness .
It's almost fairy time .
I knew him when he would've walked ten miles to see a well-crafted suit of armor ; now he spends ten nights awake in his room designing himself a fancy new jacket .
And I would die a thousand deaths cheerfully , if it made your life easier .
What ?
Lay off , already !
She can stay at her father's house .
Well , I'm sorry for your niece .
If love is blind , it can't hit the target .
If you let go of your power to attract me , I won't have any power to follow you .
What man is that ?
If I can cure him from his fever and tame him , and get him back to Naples , he'd make a great present for any emperor .
Sweet Phoebe , have pity on me .
When his god falls asleep , the monster will snatch his wine bottle .
You swear never to mention what you've seen .
God have mercy on us !
I was born in Pisa , famous for its serious citizens , like my father before me ; my father , Vincentio , a successful , world-traveled merchant , was one of the
But even if I thought you were right , it doesn't matter .
What a miracle !
Why did you send so many ?
Shame on you , get on board !
Be thrifty .
If you don't need it for some important reason , then give it back to me .
Bianca's love made me trade places with Tranio while he masqueraded as me around town .
Where are you hiding ?
Gentlemanly manners have more sway around here than force does .
There's a fool sharing my bed now .
That's the truth .
You've got something for me ?
Imagine them locking me out on a night like this !
Let me embrace you .
Good morning , neighbor Baptista .
Oh-ho-ho , kid !
We'll meet at the Elephant .
We'll listen to him .
By this token , you'll be admitted to their cell .
So , by Christ , I'll cut off your head .
These are bad omens , but I hope , I hope , they don't predict my future .
Sir Toby needs help right away .
If I could colonize this island , my lord , He'd cultivate weeds on it .
Antonio will guarantee it , hmmm .
They tell me you've done everything you can to talk him out of what he's doing .
Oh , that's pathetic !
Go back and tell your king I do not seek an encounter with him now but would be willing to march on to Calais without interference , for , to be honest , though it's probably unwise to confess this to a powerful enemy who has the advantage , my men are considerably weakened by illness , my numbers reduced , and those few men I have almost no better than so many Frenchmen , though when they were in good form , I tell you , herald , I thought three Frenchmen walked on every pair of English legs .
Are all the cups and glasses in their places , the tablecloths laid out , everything in order ?
Time , you thwart my dreadful plans .
We all expect a nice answer from you , Jew .
Please .
Thank you , my noble lord .
Right , and well said .
Oh , this is wonderful , wonderful , just wonderful wonderful !
You'll have your answer soon .
Then keep your vow , fellow , when you meet the man .
That's a stupid thing to say .
Show me , show me .
Let us die honorably .
Pick up this rope ladder .
Thank you .
Not in my husband's nose .
My plans take me a roundabout way .
With this in mind , speak , my lord .
Good news , good news !
In a way" is the right way to go .
Hey , Cassio !
That knife should be in its sheath on that Montague's back , but instead it's mis-sheathed in my daughter's breast .
You mean "paragon." A The duke's leaving the temple .
I'll disguise myself in somber robes .
Yes , she will .
We'll leave , Brutus .
Are they washing out his wounds with their tears ?
I hope they don't attack us now .
That's the way great men ought to endure great losses .
He was in bed with , With her ?
I'll have to do something courageous then , because I hate intrigue .
Tell Ventidius I want to speak with him .
Give me too much of it , so I'll get sick of it and stop loving .
The nine Muses mourning the death of learning and scholarship." That's some sharp , critical satire , and it's not appropriate for a wedding .
Agreed .
So get down on your knees and beg mercy from the duke .
Please , all of you , stand up .
More and more pain for us .
But thinking like this won't help me choose a husband .
Indeed , the enemy nearly took the bridge , but he was forced to retreat , and the duke of Exeter holds the bridge .
Well , good for him !
Now , noble Buckingham , seal this alliance by embracing my wife's friends , and make me happy in your unity .
Would you mind if we woke up the king ?
I'd be ashamed to give you this .
I'll hire you again to go back to Rome .
Who'd waste his time talking to such a stupid bird ?
Oh , he hasn't ?
Good cousin , good Meg , good Ursula , come help me get dressed .
May God thank you for it .
This is the way to trick gullible fools .
Oh , sir , on her nose , which is covered with pimples , sores , and red welts .
May God and his angels guard your sacred throne and grant that you dignify it for a long time .
Wait , here's a coin for you .
That way , he'll waste his provisions and tire out his soldiers , weakening his own capacities , while we , lying still , are rested , energetic , and nimble .
If I'm not dreaming , you are Emilia .
I did , kind lady .
We argued about which was best , and now we won't get either one .
How ?
The more you joke about it , the more clearly I feel how serious it is !
If so , when it's day , where are you going to find a cave dark enough to hide your monstrous face ?
I don't have the proud melancholy of a courtier or the ambitious melancholy of a soldier or the calculated melancholy of a lawyer .
I'm telling you all this out of affection for you , so you can either keep him from carrying out his plans or prepare to accept his disgrace , which will be his own fault , not mine .
You must know that the snake will act according to his nature .
Now , I'll swear to the opposite , that the pancakes were rotten , and the mustard was fine , but even so , the knight wasn't lying .
I'm not going to bed tonight .
I didn't realize he knew her .
Let me see .
Good luck , fair gentleman .
Lord Hastings , will you go with me ?
I doubt it , since you weren't even three at the time .
Who's closest to him ?
You'll know more about it later .
Oh , what a long , tedious , exhausting night !
It may be honest , but it's never wise to bring bad news .
You both know Banquo was your enemy .
And if you treat us badly , won't we try to get revenge ?
Where is she now ? , What , will my hands never be clean ? , No more of that , my lord , no more of that .
Oh , eastern star !
Do you think Alexander the Great looked like this when he was buried ?
I've sent for him .
And what a beard trimmed like the general's or a rough uniform will do among foaming mugs and brains washed with ale , you wouldn't believe .
I'm that great gust to her fire .
But if I ran away from the Jew , I'd be following the advice of the devil , who's the very devil himself .
Oh , but I'm worried .
I've heard a lot more .
The horsemen stand frozen like candlesticks , torches in their hands .
Now , tell me , which of my bad qualities did you fall in love with first ?
I'm not going to eat dinner tonight .
Even if she lives till the end of the world , she'd keep burning an additional week .
I'm not one of his punk friends who carries a knife .
Absolutely not .
Let's meet as little as we can .
So now turn and draw your sword .
I've already told you quite plainly that my daughter will never marry you .
Here comes my lady .
Pass on the command to halt !
Now please leave me alone .
Oh , you villain , villain , you damned , smiling villain !
Love's not love when it gets mixed up with irrelevant outside matters .
Good friends , go in and have some wine with me .
I know that my hour has come .
By his dress I can tell he's my countryman , but I don't recognize him .
But you can make it up to me .
A lover would have to be weepier , of course .
I think he only loves life because of Bassanio .
What were the primary evils he claimed women were guilty of ?
Now you have only the memory of what you were , which tortures you when you consider what you've become .
Anyone who says you're a man must not notice how young you are .
Just now .
Mercutio , you hang out with Romeo .
Virtue turns to vice if it's misused .
How will we pass the time without some entertainment ?
There's Dolabella , who was sent from Caesar .
These lovers are saying some strange things , Theseus .
Why bother with them ?
If each grain of sand had a tongue to eulogize , my horse would be a topic for them all .
Is it true , is it true ?
In any case , do what you want .
Let's slash their backs and grab 'em like we do rabbits , from behind .
Oh , Brutus !
Let's go .
Look , here come two noble animals , a man and a lion .
She's desperate .
You need to learn what ants know well about winter , there's no point in slaving away if there's no hope for profit .
Yours are slow and awkward .
It's the same kind of guy who got you upset and made you suspect I'd cheated on you with the Moor .
Tell him we could have driven him back at Harfleur but thought it unwise to burst a pustule before it had fully ripened .
I will not do them wrong .
I don't deny it .
What's your name ?
Will she go to bed now ?
Do you recognize my voice , noble lord ?
Farewell .
Father , go ahead .
Is it good or bad ?
Messala !
Don't say "banishment." From now on , you are banished from Verona .
Gentle boy , good night .
Since I'm suddenly all the rage , it will be worth the cost .
And when will you see him again ?
It will give you some protection from this storm .
If you're my friend , you'll let me see his letter .
So go out there and give him what he wants .
Why are you enraged ?
I'd kiss you before I spoke .
So how can anyone say I'm alone , when the whole world is here to look at me ?
But I'm still fairly high-ranking .
Please , Horatio , go with him .
As a wandering lunatic , he can do whatever he wants .
Dear man , calm your rage .
I know what I'm talking about .
Yes , I do .
I won't lodge any more than that under my roof .
Ask her to help you get back your position .
I have a lot to do before noon .
Why , the he that will marry this woman .
Am I Dromio ?
Ariel , go order my goblin servants to make these fellows ' bones ache , give them muscle cramps all over , and give them more bruises than leopards have spots .
Make it a word and a blow .
There is a man who loves you better than your husband could .
But what's your trade ?
Was it you that was always plotting to kill him ?
I've transferred Richard's body to a new grave and on it poured more tears of remorse than it has shed drops of blood .
Evil villain !
We come to hate that which controls us .
That's foolish .
Are we all ready ?
On this hill and in despair , with his slave Pindarus .
I'll do so .
Here's a drink .
Take them away .
I have to eat my dinner now .
I think Belman is just as good , my lord .
What men have you lost , Fluellen ?
I have come to announce that Juno has asked you , Ceres , goddess of the fields and the earth , to leave your rich farms of wheat , rye , barley , oats , and peas , the hills where the
I won't say anything negative about what he might be .
Have you not spoken to her since then ?
Come , put it over my face .
I only need to show your sword to Caesar and tell him about your death to get into his good favor .
Take him to the surgeons .
I've seen her claim to be dying twenty times before , and for far less reason .
You , will you join with me ?
You sent me to the port to find a ship .
Wasn't that the best thing to do ?
What a heavy sigh !
That can't happen .
It's the lark that sings so out of tune , making such harsh noise .
But taste my story , and relish it by paying attention .
You But , uncle , we're being disrespected .
No , my lord .
You know what you know .
I'll wait till his beard grows in , if you'll just hurry up and tell me what chin that beard is on .
He didn't say anything , he's reading .
I know she trusts you and tells you everything .
Tell me , Captain Macmorris , have you left the tunnels ?
But once he got there , the duke learned that Lorenzo and his lover Jessica were together in a gondola .
My dear madam , why are you in mourning ?
I have a bad cold that's bothering me .
I won't wrong any of my friends , because I don't have any to mourn for me , and I won't have wronged the world , because I don't have anything in the world .
If he were dead , you'd be weeping for him .
I will , lady .
Come on .
Excellently , excellently .
I'm being repaid for that now .
Oh heavens !
Oh , I can buy twenty husbands at any market .
You see , we're not alone in our unhappiness .
Your love will use it to climb up to your window while it's dark .
Goodbye , good sir .
My learned lord , kindly explain to us the legal and religious grounds for why this French Salic law either should or shouldn't bar me in my claim .
Take him away .
But I'm sorry , I'm not allowed to let you visit them .
My servant !
Is it possible for a mutt to lend three thousand ducats ? " Or should I bend down low , and in a humble and submissive voice say :
I don't know , ma'am .
I hope maybe then you'll send him back home soon .
My lord , please go inside here .
I'm sure of that .
What a worthy man !
Her
Hang on a minute , here's some money for you .
I didn't expect any better from him once he got involved with Mistress Shore .
I swear , before I die I'm going to see you sick with love .
I'm amazed how similar you and your daughters are .
Wait just a minute , you brazen hussy .
Then be so kind as to show them in .
From now on I'll put up with my anguish until the anguish itself cries out , "Enough , enough ! " and disappears .
They're playing with me .
I'll bring you to him right away .
Bring him with us .
The brilliant Sir Topas !
that mountain of insanity that wants to marry me , I could find it in my heart to stay here and become a witch myself .
Here he comes .
Oh Banquo , Banquo , the king has been murdered !
How can this drama be so many contradictory things ?
He locks himself up alone in his bedroom , shuts his windows to keep out the beautiful daylight , and makes himself an artificial night .
As good a wife as she is , that's how good a husband I am to you .
I'll be nearby .
Your sister's the better soldier of the two .
Excuse me , young man , how do I get to the Jew's residence ?
Hey , if I'd remembered something about him , I could have had a good comeback for my uncle , touching on his growth worse than he touched on mine .
No , no , put your hat back on .
She was too attached to her filthy marriage ever to do a thing like that !
Don't ever tell anyone what you've seen tonight .
Well , if you have to go , you have to go .
My dear lord , tell me what's bothering you .
You thought about it too long , considering what you found there .
Were these things we're talking about really here ?
I'll be nearby to help you , and between the two of us we can handle him .
Dromio , bring this money to the Centaur Inn , where we're lodging , and wait there until I come .
Malcolm !
Come to think of it , I am feeling sleepy .
My lord , we were sent for .
We shall , my liege .
I owe you nothing until I receive the necklace .
And now I'm going to leave your despised company .
Lights , lights , get us some lights !
What were those things ?
If you dressed only to stay warm , you wouldn't need these gorgeous clothes you're wearing , which don't keep you warm at all .
Here , you there , Grumio .
My name is Edgar , and I'm your father's son .
See the wound that Casca made .
What ?
What are your names ?
Who doesn't know that the good duke is dead ?
And hot as ginger .
Let me go , gentlemen .
So now everyone will point at me and say , "Look , there goes the wife of that comedian Petruchio , if he could be bothered to marry the pathetic thing ! "
Find the people whose names are on this list ?
I will , my liege .
Oh , my dear mistress , I won't be able to finish this work until sunset at the earliest .
Give me my sword .
I'm glad about that .
That's him , madam .
So go to your deaths , poor miserable wretches , the pain of which may merciful God give you the strength to endure .
They have their exits and their entrances , and in his lifetime a man will play many parts , his life separated into seven acts .
Yes , certainly .
Just you wait .
Yes , madam .
But was this near the shore ?
If I were to make a prediction regarding this union , I wouldn't say that .
Watch me like a hawk .
Come on , you keep getting paler .
The drink , the drink !
With the handicap they've given me , I think I'll win .
Yes , do that .
Didn't I meet up with your allies ?
At least it's possible in Denmark .
You lie .
May the gods bless Antony today !
Ah , the countess is coming !
Lady Olivia will have you executed for not showing up .
I gave you everything , And it was about time too .
I'm positively stuffed with air , I eat so much of it .
I meant to say the Lord Protector .
Romeo !
He said she was unfaithful ?
But with you it's different .
Come on , we're wasting precious daylight .
Me neither .
The first drink makes him a fool , the second makes him crazy , and the third drowns him .
Are you joking ?
You see me standing here , Lord Bassanio .
Meanwhile , we're the ones who need you .
A man , sir .
Is the visor of my helmet working better now ?
Brother John Bates , isn't that dawn breaking over there ?
He has captured Toryne .
We're waiting here for you .
It will be as the gods see fit .
If there were two men like you , pretty soon there'd be none because the two of you would kill each other .
I'm afraid his mother may have had an affair with a blacksmith .
But , tell me , is young George Stanley alive ?
Well , until that time , don't come near me .
Go .
It's unbelievable .
Oh , Caesar , read mine first , for my petition affects you more directly .
Please , go away .
Inside , sir , with the earl .
What's the message from the English king ?
Trust me , you could slide all the way from my shoulder to my heel taking no more of a running start than the distance between my head and my neck .
If he seems game to our plan , encourage him to join us and explain all our reasons .
Make it eight and eight .
Does anyone here know who I am ?
I remember him well , and my memory tells me that he deserves your praise .
I know that young men look forward to their rest .
The duke is temperamental .
Someone who makes a promise and breaks it .
Will you , Strato ?
Yes , my lord .
Now , Antony , our prayers have been answered .
Give me your love instead , as I give you mine .
Antipholus , aren't you originally from Corinth ?
For Brutus's sake , I am indebted to you .
It's about you .
I never knew a woman who loved a man so much .
Now go , set up for dinner .
Brother , Quiet .
What do you think of his belief ?
Because , my good king , England is so poorly led , her scepter so foolishly borne by a vain , silly , shallow , impulsive youth , that she's hardly a threat .
Go back to my sister's .
There's a nicer piece of work right here .
Some men don't like roast pig , others go crazy if they see a cat , and others can't help urinating when they hear bagpipes .
I swear by my holy order , I thought you were smarter and more rational than this .
Send him on his way quickly .
Speak , nephew .
Before I hear him , I want to decide some important issues that are on my mind concerning my throne and France .
Nor is it up to you , my lord .
Come on , you're drunk .
How would you woo her ?
Don't disturb his soul .
In suicide , gods make the weak strong .
He's as smart as they come , but just a jester .
But oh , how odd it is to have to ask for my child's forgiveness !
Portia , are you really gone ?
I've lurked in the shadows here to watch the downfall of my enemies .
Here , noble lord .
You ass !
Then follow me and listen to my speech , friends .
Teach me to forget to think !
Really , are you afraid of that ?
Farewell , kind master .
Come on , can I get you two to make up ?
He's thirty years old .
Is the building of your love already in ruins ?
Stanley , Richmond is your wife's son .
We'll have to think about it carefully .
You know , you're right .
The clock's just striking twelve .
How many people who are humble now would be great then ?
Her ladies-in-waiting saw her go to bed , and early this morning the bed was empty .
So I won't choose what many men desire , because I won't jump on the bandwagon and include myself with the whole crude population .
And even though I'm in a distasteful mood , I'll work on being happy .
Don't refuse it .
I'll put on some poor and ragged clothes and smudge my face with dirt .
What's the matter ?
I meant they had to give her credit .
The day will come when you'll wish I could help you cast spells against this poisonous , hunchbacked toad .
We must tie them up and leave them in some dark room .
Listen , your Romeo will be here tonight .
How foolish your fears seem now , Calphurnia !
I'll flatter anyone who flatters me , though what I've accomplished on land can not be denied .
Who is her mother ?
One thing is certain : he's out of control .
Bleed , bleed , poor country !
They are harder than the stones the house is made of .
And because you interrupt us so that we can't dance for them , the winds have made fogs rise up out of the sea and fall down on the rivers so that the rivers flood , just to get revenge on you .
Orsino , sir , please don't call me those names .
Oh , this is a painful time !
Don't worry , I couldn't care less .
And now he's gone .
If that is not granted , he reduces his requests and asks only that he be allowed to live as a private man in Athens .
I might as well go before the King of France , who took my youngest daughter without a dowry , kneel before his throne , and beg him to give me a tiny pension to stay alive .
Friends , come here .
Young girls call it "love-in-idleness." Bring me that flower .
That's what the Prince and my fiance say .
You mean I should groan and tell you ?
Please , follow straight after me .
I'll put her on that .
I would have made it short .
Let's follow them to see how this turns out .
Run after that obnoxious messenger , the duke's servant .
You're welcome here .
Sir , I'm upset .
He has some wonderful home furnishings , that's what he calls them , that he'll use to decorate his house when he gets one .
I remember the plan .
This would be enough to make my husband suspect me , if he wasn't so free of jealousy .
Stay there and fortify it well against the French .
By Jesus , I am your Majesty's countryman , and I don't care who knows it .
Are you good at those kinds of things ?
It's a nice hazy feeling , so give in to it .
And since our quarrel is with his future behavior , not what he does now , I must frame the argument like this : if his position is furthered , his character will fulfill these predictions .
Well , this is what happens when men let themselves be ruled by women .
I will see you tomorrow , then .
Tom's chilly .
Hello , sir .
How's that ?
Be friendly to people but don't overdo it .
I am the greatest , but I was able to do the least .
We age and die because they wear us out .
Hey !
He ran out that way , sir , when he couldn't , Follow him , now !
Is that called for in the contract ?
What's wrong with my niece ?
Now , my companions and brothers in exile , hasn't experience made this simple life sweeter than a life of glittery pomp and circumstance ?
Didn't I tell you she was innocent ?
So all the work that oxen and farmers have done in plowing the fields has been for nothing , because the unripe grain has rotted before it was ripe .
You thought because he didn't speak English like a native he couldn't handle an English club .
Let the gods who stirred up this dreadful storm bring their enemies to light .
You , Roderigo !
Oh , he's drunk , Sir Toby , for a whole hour now .
Oh , that splendid Caesar !
I'm sick , Charmian .
Tell me seriously , who is the one you love ?
Got it ?
Good morrow , neighbor , whither away so fast ?
Hey , hey !
Then , if you dare to acknowledge it , I'll take up my quarrel with you .
Good morning to you .
Your words , like your wounds , bring you honor .
The next man who swings his sword must not care about his life , because the instant he strikes , he dies .
And you told me to bury my love .
Yes , it is .
Servants , take these gentlemen to see Hamlet .
Cousin , you didn't used to be so thickheaded .
Not for your entire fairy kingdom. , Come , fairies , let's go .
I do believe your Majesty takes no shame in wearing the leek on Saint Davy's Day .
Too late , good Diomedes .
Let him be the devil if he wants to , I don't care .
In order to find a mother and a brother , I too have lost myself , unhappily .
Oh , please let me .
My lord ?
Do this immediately , and send him packing .
It's obvious .
Dead .
Here , my good lord .
Get away from me !
Are you coming monster ?
What is this blood that stains the stony entrance of this tomb ?
Yes , my lord .
Don't " Yes , Nurse , what about that ?
I need a doctor .
Why , what's the matter ?
By Hercules , I think I'm right .
Not to his father's house .
What do you mean , do I think so ?
Women are lucky , then .
Good night to you both .
Tranio , I saw her coral-pink lips move and perfume the air with her breath .
With one little toss of his head , He can scare you off for good .
You'll hear more from me by midnight .
It would be bad if she knew about Benedick's love and teased him about it .
Good sir , as a friend , I advise you to leave this place .
Titinius is lying face-up .
Our era should be ashamed !
If you're Trinculo , then come out .
Come over here , gentlemen , and put your hands on my sword again .
And I wouldn't ask for any dowry except for her to play another trick like this one .
You don't know ?
We have feelings .
Everyone can see that , and even blind men can smell the stench of his misery now .
That's true , and with good reason .
He wouldn't get drunk much , since there's no wine here .
Didn't they ever whisper ?
What !
Come , sir , no more. , Oswald , come here !
The one who chooses me will get what he deserves" !
Gregory , remember how to slash .
Send out more cavalry .
Well , hello there , Horatio !
I'd bet my life that , as young as you are , you've fallen in love with someone .
Please , pay him immediately .
Tyrrel , I mean those bastards in the Tower .
Messala , today is my birthday , I was born on this very day .
What , all my children and their mother dead in one fell swoop ?
My son will win .
I thought that thing you're talking about was a man .
The storm has begun and everything is at stake .
Rub his temples .
Where is Gloucester ?
I'm so crazy about you !
What's your name ?
You're making a terrible racket out here !
Tell me , you villainous lowlife , where are my children ?
She's not going to borrow money from them .
Let me talk , good lady .
But , hang on !
Welcome , dear madam .
Well , old man , I'll tell you news of your son .
At least two hours past .
If my eyes aren't deceiving me , goodbye , love .
No , your words are too precious to be wasted on dogs .
That's more than we know .
That's terrible !
Don't take too long , unless you want our king to come after me to ask what's holding things up , because he's already landed here .
Great kings of France and England , I owe you both equal service and loyalty .
If it were me , I'd be very upset too .
Are you really as in love as your poems declare ?
I'll hide in the arbor .
I am .
I'll leave you now .
The poor rude world doesn't have her equal .
Let me come clean .
Your grace , the person who is going to deliver the prologue is ready .
This isn't a good moment for jokes , save them till a happier time .
Or like a whale .
Yes , sir .
But two men complimenting each other is like two baboons getting together .
Good to see you , Master Antipholus .
Cry , "whoa ! " to your tongue , please .
The wine of life has been poured out , and only the dregs remain .
I found him here , Beating ?
That was a fine fanfare , boys .
I sent him there , sir , but his crimes deserved a worse punishment .
Show her in .
Wouldn't that have been just as appropriate ?
What , are you crazy ?
Tell me , what does he think of our situation ?
And now I'll do it .
If you sink , you're dragging love down .
Look , here comes our honored hostess !
Have some of my servants take care of Malvolio .
Is this the king we offered to ransom ?
You can hear them all night long .
With any luck , the sea and new countries will push out these thoughts that have somehow taken root in his mind .
You wake up to have fun , and you start work when you go to bed .
Either we go after Pompey or he'll come after us .
Look out for him in the corner of the orchard as if you were a sheriff's deputy .
It is not destiny's fault , but our own faults , that we're slaves .
And I hope you realized I wasn't very happy about it .
Let's put our heads together .
Demetrius loves her , and he doesn't love you .
Come on , tell me in broken music , for your voice is music and your English broken .
No , Antony .
Either put away your sword or use it to help me stop this fight .
Until her beautiful life's end .
Cesario , go visit that cruel Olivia one more time .
Let the ship sail close to the wind .
Who does it gallop for ?
Our bodies are like gardens and our willpower is like the gardener .
One of these three boxes contains her lovely picture .
Hey , open the door !
You abused me to my face .
But did your sister die of love ?
Now he'll work himself up to a fury .
Give me details .
Good Lord !
Forgotten you !
Have you mangled my tongue so badly in these seven short years that my only son can no longer recognize my weak , sorrow-ravaged voice ?
He was so slick in covering over his plans that if it hadn't been for his love affair with Shore's wife , I would never have suspected him .
I'll follow .
I'll make her come right away , I promise you .
What's the news with you ?
You do Stay , Please , tell me what you think of me .
There are more things in heaven and earth , Horatio , than you've even dreamed of .
The actors are here .
Seriously , cousin , I love a woman .
Quickly , tell me how .
Thus , it should be clear as day that King Pepin's title , Hugh Capet's claim , and the resolution of King Lewis's doubts all plainly derive from the female .
Let them put fear in your heart .
In a minute , sir .
Yes , my lord ?
My strength is all gone , as if in a dream .
Moonshine and Lion are left to bury the dead .
I've acted like such a villain !
Look , here's where Cassius's dagger pierced it .
who can control his fate ?
Put out your torches .
I hope so .
I don't completely distrust you .
You were right the first time .
Look , love , see how devoted I am ?
Cassio , my lord ?
Good morning , worthy Caesar .
I know his eyes are worshiping some other woman , or why wouldn't he be here ?
He never did harm that I heard of .
That's it !
Caesar , you are revenged with the very same sword that killed you .
Swallows have built nests in Cleopatra's sails .
Answer me that first .
He's safe , Antony .
Seyton ! , I'm sick at heart when I see , Seyton , come here ! , This battle will either secure my reign forever or else topple me from the throne .
Just now , my lord .
Everyone thought it would pass then , and it probably would have had it not been for the great civil unrest and uncertainty of the time , which required the matter to be put off .
Sir , he may still be alive .
Come with me .
What time is it ?
Gracious Queen , even Herod of Judea wouldn't dare look at you unless you were in a good mood .
If he hadn't , we'd all be embarrassed to look at him .
Please tell him I have surrendered to his fortune .
It's better here than outside .
Signior Baptista , I'm glad to see you. , Sir , this is the gentleman I told you of .
In Alexandria he condemned Rome , and that's not all .
Call in the messengers and we'll find out .
Oh , oh , oh !
We've finished our business .
The father and the master and the king didn't order their subordinates ' deaths when they ordered their services .
You knew my father well ; therefore , you know me , the sole heir to all his property and possessions , which I have added to rather than depleted .
If you want to go to hell , there are better ways to do it than killing yourself .
It's a good thing you're not a piece of fish .
Can we have some water please here ? , Come and wash , Kate , make yourself at home .
Help , dear lord , or the battle will be lost !
Do you want my true opinion ?
I think he's got the money .
Who ?
If your affection for me doesn't convince you to come , don't let my letter do so." Oh , my darling , make your arrangements and go !
Be patient , madam .
If we welcome our punishment , we punish it right back by seeming to take it lightly .
Honestly , I didn't see it , but I felt it in her hot breath .
When he couldn't what ?
I am the duke who loved your father .
Please go on .
What did you say , uncle ?
May a plague strike both your families !
Were you mad when you spoke to me so madly ?
Even if the news is sad , tell me with a smile on your face .
Romeo is hateful , even though God isn't .
I thought I had escaped from the Tower and was on a ship to France with my brother Richard , who persuaded me to leave my cabin and walk on deck with him .
Why are you making these faces ?
Yes , Caesar ?
Gentlemen , gentlemen , Gentlemen , don't speak .
No , just to the gates of hell , where the devil will meet me , with the horns on his head like a cuckold , and say , "Go up to heaven , Beatrice .
I've finished it for you , and it ends in "Margaret." He's turned your curse against you , Margaret .
Oh , heavenly mixture !
Does anyone know if Donalbain is with his brother ?
Strangle her in her bed , the same bed she's contaminated .
I'm a gentleman , sir , and my name is Conrade .
I will , sir .
But since Laertes is better , we've given him a handicap .
Brother , I'm giving you good advice .
This may end without anyone getting killed .
Just remember to grab his books first , since without them he's just a poor fool like me , and can't command a single spirit .
So go in peace .
Who's that calling ?
Show yourself in the form of a sigh .
May God bring you sleep !
Your cheeks are too flushed for me to believe that was a fake faint .
They show their bloody heralds of battle , and something must be done immediately .
Get out , you dark-skinned gypsy !
Let's hear someone play the triangle and the sticks .
Give me your arm .
Go away .
Get ready , my lord .
But your words are as sweet as honey , you've stolen from the bees and left them with nothing .
Oh God , who is , by the way , the best comic of them all .
Whew !
I swear that Claudio will pay dearly for this .
Well , then , I thank you , though I'm such a beggar that even my thanks are not worth much .
Please , young man , don't make me angry .
Listen up , uncle .
You'll be ashamed of this forever !
Isn't that the king ?
A little water will wash away the evidence of our guilt .
Well , if you could have just an inch of better fortune than me , where would you like the improvement ?
Have you ever slept before while such a terrible deed was done ?
My dear lord , you know how passionately stubborn the duke is .
But how long will her beautiful life last ?
But what about Cicero ?
What time is it ?
And I think she's at least thirty .
Richard loves neither me nor any of you .
Go on , go on .
Either there are wars in heaven , or else the world , too insolent toward the gods , provokes them to send destruction .
I'll be right here , silent .
Get me some poison tonight , Iago .
Unnatural acts will cause Good night , good doctor .
I have the authority to dismiss this court , unless Bellario comes today .
Come , sweet Audrey .
Alas , you misunderstood everything !
As old and white-haired as you are , and you're such a traitor ?
As wicked as I am , they were slaughtered because of me , not because of anything they did .
But I would kill you by petting you too much .
So be quiet .
My lord , I have news for you .
Octavius , lead your forces slowly out to the left side of the level field .
If you read this , Caesar , you might live .
I think you've been frowning too much recently .
Parting is such sweet sorrow that I'll say good night until tonight becomes tomorrow .
I know they do , and I certainly deserve it .
Good-bye .
He's made me a little sore , I'll admit .
I promise I'll carry the wood faster .

I should always be wise .
All this" ?
If it turns out he wasn't , certain people are going to get it .
It was obviously a hit .
Do what he says , William .
Tut , tut , you've become rather icy .
Go ahead , say "Amen." No more talking .
He says he'll come .
I'm not sure I can wait that long .
I hope you'll recognize me when we meet again .
Who am I , sir ?
Listen to me .
Not one drop sooner .
Go find him , please , and bring him to my tent .
No .
Or should I say it's her uncle ?
Until then , think about the well-being of Rome .
By this sword" is an oath , and oaths must be kept .
My dear Gloucester !
Don't let the heavens hear these chattery women abuse the Lord's anointed king .
Here I go .
And she's fierce , even though she's little .
The street is narrow here .
Amen to that !
I'd give anything to keep them from seeing you here .
Good night , good night .
Who's there ?
A ghost , a ghost !
Go find the traitor Gloucester .
Remain calm until midnight , and then you'll see what the trouble is .
The door is open , sir .
Brother , hey !
What does it matter ?
Go on , my loving lord .
I'll see her like this .
Make yourself comfortable .
If you hadn't shown up on cue , my lord , Lord Hastings was going to take your part , I mean , he was going to speak for you , in the crowning of the king .
Here , here , sir !
Stand still .
Listen .
Some water will fix that .
Decius , go tell them that Caesar won't come .
Her husband , you rascal .
Thank you , sir .
Do you really think so ?
My mind is confused .
Was he sad or happy ?
Your brother Don John the Bastard has run away from Messina .
Was it you that he rescued ?
But wait a minute !
That's why I praise myself , who , if I do say so myself , is quite praiseworthy .
Why are we talking about this ?
But what's this I see ?
If you don't mind , I need to rest a bit .
Please , sir ; crack jokes over lunch .
Remember to see me today .
Yes , I truly think He did great good .
I must go and continue the business Fulvia started .
What trade , boy ?
Please sir , if love or money can buy anything in this empty place , tell us where we can rest and feed ourselves .
Don't trust rotten planks .
I remember very well where I should be , and here I am .
Let them come , I don't care .
A reason ?
Yes , with Cassio .
Neither death nor life will stop me from coming .
This is going even better than I planned .
Mustardseed .
When has anyone ever put you down like that .
I'll go tell the king about this .
Hello , spirit !
Half of your wealth goes to Antonio .
Please treat my babies well .
I had only one child , one poor child , one poor and loving child , the one thing I had to rejoice and comfort myself , and cruel Death has stolen it from me !
What else can I say ?
They steal hearts .
I Isn't this good ?
These are gracious tears .
Good gentlemen , look like you're rested and happy .
They certainly do like to butt heads !
Isn't he an honest man ?
I've never been your enemy .
For shame , bring Juliet out here .
They are .
Please go inside .
I wanted to teach her how perfectly I love her , kinsman , and that's good English .
Robin Starveling , you're going to play Thisbe's mother. , Tom Snout , the handyman .
Don't shed any blood , or cut less or more than exactly a pound of flesh .
Good day to you , Captain Fluellen .
That's all he asks for himself .
Who should hang them ?
We need more help !
I think I do .
He's a knight .
Tell me , you monster , where is my son Lucentio ?
They couldn't , they wouldn't .
If she wants to be proud , or "honest , " as she calls it , she can just marry her own pride .
Now I'm afraid we've lost your son forever .
Where are you all off to ?
Horatio , tell me something .
Listen !
Who can stain that name with a just accusation ?
My sweet darling cries when she sees me work and tells me that such a wonderful man never performed such lowly tasks before .
You're busted .
Now , Eros .
You'll get some of what you want .
It's arranged .
Ask him in here .
I'm better off because of my enemies , and worse off because of my friends .
Thank you , sir .
Once we have covered the two servants with blood , and used their daggers to kill , won't people believe that they were the culprits ?
And you've done well on land .
No , but the barber's assistant has been seen with him .
Not even one success ?
As long as hell and Richard want it .
I bet she's fast asleep .
But she's modest and ladylike too .
What do you want ?
She cheated on me , and she was a whore .
I wish I were something better , because right now I'm a big fool .
His life was gentle , and the elements mixed so well in him that Nature might stand up and say to all the world , "This was a man." Let's treat him according to his virtue , with all the respect and rituals of burial .
All I have to do is remove it .
After such a long period of grief , we will have such a celebration !
Me , uncle ?
Will you cry ?
And make sure the servants are less friendly to his knights .
You may as well try to turn the sun to ice by fanning its face with a peacock feather .
I'm here , my lord .
Where is this man ?
Didn't you argue it out with your tailor for wearing one of his new suits before the right season ?
Is tomorrow the 15th of March , boy ?
Be quiet , be quiet .
There was a kind of war in my brain that wouldn't let me sleep .
He bids them good morning with a modest smile and calls
Messenger after messenger delivered news of your bravery to the king with praise for how you defended his country .
If everyone looked so lovely in their sorrow , then sorrow would be highly prized .
All your talents and gifts didn't arouse as much envy from him as this one quality did , though to me it's far from your best attribute .
Caesar's better qualities exist in Brutus , and we will crown him .
Hide yourself , good Romeo .
But I'll deliver Sir Andrew's challenge by word of mouth , describing Sir Andrew as courageous in battle and convincing the young gentleman that Sir Andrew is furious , impetuous , and a skilled fighter ( he'll believe me because he's young ) .
Is that you , wife ?
Let's go at it , coward !
My spirit has been as proud as each of yours , my courage as great , and my reason perhaps even better suited to bandy words back and forth and exchange frown for frown .
I know because I dreamed of money bags last night .
Enough of this frivolous talk .
Here comes the Prince and Claudio .
You're so much older than you look !
Oh , that's very nice !
What then , sick ?
It was the day he overcame the Nervii warriors .
I pray that God will let me learn from women like that , not to follow their bad example , but to avoid it !
Oh Setebos , these are handsome spirits !
Richard has set boundaries between my love and theirs ?
You're stripped of your power and your command , and Cassio will govern Cyprus .
The king , whom I hope God will protect better than you would like , can't get a minute's rest without you bothering him with your outrageous complaints .
Caius Ligarius doesn't like Caesar , who berated him for speaking well of Pompey .
Please go find out for certain who has arrived .
As long as heaven and nature extend it .
Your peace of mind depends on him .
Oh , God help me !
Even for a Good morning , lieutenant .
All right , now I'm starting to lose my cool .
Men may sleep , and when they do they may have their throats with them , and some people say knives have blades .
They tell me he died well , and settled his scores .
There wasn't any problem .
If Hamlet makes the first or second hit , or gets back at Laertes by making the third hit , then let my soldiers give him a military salute .
Where , where ?
You can be married tomorrow if you want .
From soldiers .
Get lost !
I recognize his walk .
Or are you low , vulgar , and of the common people ?
There's still a spot here .
While he was alive , I lived only to serve him and oppose his enemies .
Good-bye , son .
When we see that our betters have the same problems we do , we can almost forget our own misery .
It isn't good for your health to expose your weak body to the raw , cold morning .
Can't you understand what I'm saying ?
He mustn't go to prison .
He's not very tall , but he's tall enough for his age .
What is the matter here ?
I won't hurt him .
It's been my bad luck to remain alive long enough to be able to tell the sad stories of my own misfortunes .
Now , before the sun comes up and burns away the dew , I have to fill this basket of mine with poisonous weeds and medicinal flowers .
Get out , you horrible poison .
There's something else to be done .
Come on , men !
I just speak directly .
My sister would be much more offended to have her trusted messenger abused and assaulted just for carrying out her orders. , Put his legs in the stocks .
He didn't know how to stop it .
He is like a god and knows the truth .
Let it be a quarrel between us , if you live .
How often tonight have my old feet stumbled on gravestones !
I recognize the handwriting .
I am their mother .
Now would you please listen once again to the request I made to you earlier ?
That's the one .
Yes , my lord .
He who chooses me will get what he deserves." I'll assume I deserve the very best. , Give me a key for this one .
I'm sure you aren't Launcelot , my boy .
Hail , brave friend !
Disrespected in my own house by a spool of thread !
Now , we go contentedly to freedom , not banishment .
My letters are ready to go .
Yes , ma'am , we have .
He never did anything in his whole life that looked as good as the way he died .
When you fight against your country's enemies , you will be paid for your efforts with your country's wealth .
Sa , sa , sa , sa .
Those who smile at it will soon be dead themselves .
Harry le Roy .
I never saw her till now .
Follow him , friends .
What does this mean ?
Well , sir , go inside .
Go , daughter .
I wish my daughter were dead at my feet wearing those jewels !
I'll send goblins out at night to work their nasty deeds on you .
If this is so , be patient , sister .
Yes , he knew about it the whole time .
Can I do what all the Parthian arrows , though shot by enemies , could not ?
Oh , conspiracy , are you ashamed to show your face even at night , when evil things are most free ?
Go back with her ?
What an idiotic place this world is .
He was very upset that Fortinbras had taken advantage of his being old and sick to deceive him , and he ordered Fortinbras's arrest .
Innocent sweethearts , you have no idea who's responsible for your father's death .
It looks better in a king than his own crown looks on him .
I'll follow you , my lord .
Now it's time to get back to my studying , since I have a lot of serious business to take care of before dinner .
Could my good brother-in-law , a man to whom the
Must I bite ?
No , who are Long live the king !
Ready .
The cowslip flowers are her bodyguards .
I think if we had fought , we would have proven too young and strong for them after all .
To tell you the truth , I was just going to your house .
As I said before , Antonio will guarantee the loan .
My arm is sore .
You can't stay here any longer .
Let me ask you something in private .
No way , then , I'll run .
Well , that turned out well in the end .
No , not a penny .
Oh , if only we had with us here ten thousand of those men back home in England who aren't working today .
Here , sir !
It's really the only way , Sir Andrew .
But not a member of the royal family , like me .
Please don't make fun of me .
We don't intend any harm to you , nor to anyone else .
be like the fountain that my children and all my descendants flow from , has rejected me !
You say you have news that's old ?
And leave us , Publius , in case the people storming us should harm you .
Is there any way I could show such friendship to you ?
Oh , Pyramus , get up !
Why do I have to do that ?
Just keep your love under control , and don't let yourself become a target of his lust .
Promise me you'll let me live , and I'll confess the truth .
And make sure to carry a prayer book in your hand and to stand between two priests , okay ?
That only proves how inexperienced you are .
Thank you for asking , uncle .
Nah , I'll never be aware of my own wit , until I break my shins on it .
Well hello , my good boy .
The note is a big fat liar if it says I said so .
May God choose you to receive his grace .
I frown at him , but he still loves me .
No , lady .
Are these wind instruments ?
Oh pain !
I can remember the past seventy years pretty well , and in all that time I have seen dreadful hours and strange things .
I hope I enjoy wearing it , for my heart is very heavy .
Lady Beatrice is angry with you .
What an ogre you are to slander someone you don't know , and who doesn't know you !
What things , my lord ?
I hope she doesn't have a crush on me !
I swear , anyone smart who laughs at these courts jesters is nothing but a jester's apprentice .
I will walk around and mingle with all of you , playing the humble host .
Therefore , tell me , what is he doing at sea ?
I'll hide and listen in .
A leathermaker will last nine years .
I won't bother you .
These chatty fellows who can rhyme their way into a lady's good graces always reason themselves out again .
Who could be out of things to say if he were with the girl he loves ?
People who are either too serious or too silly are awful .
Please put that log down and rest a while .
Go bring them all here ; I give you power over them .
He's dead .
Dead .
Tyrrel , come back shortly after dinner and tell me the details of their deaths .
Sir , I can't .
Tell me , is your tardy master close at hand ?
It'll be my job to talk about how Benedick is sick with love for Beatrice .
And , being a man of your breeding , you're going to be married under some shrubs like a beggar ?
What !
Lie down right there .
Well , we were all born to die .
Saddle up my horses .
Horrid villain !
Your humor is a spicy sauce .
You didn't offend us , you offended the king .
He and I will be there .
Why have you collapsed ?
And why do you blame me for loving you ?
Talk makes him crazy .
The oars were made of silver , and the oarsmen rowed in time to flute music .
He wasn't sad , because he knows that his disposition affects others .
Let the Egyptians and Phoenicians go swimming .
He does nothing but frown , as if he wants to say , "If you don't want me , I don't care." He doesn't even smile when he hears funny stories .
No , lieutenant , God , gentlemen , Help , Lieutenant , sir , Montano , Help , men ! , The night guard is coming !
I spoke with a Frenchman yesterday who said that a Venetian ship loaded with treasure was wrecked in the English Channel .
The only profit I seek is a peaceful match .
I will fight him there .
What if a fellow were bringing him a couple of hundred pounds to toss around ?
Come with me , Silvius .
Will you meet me right away at Ninny's grave ?
I have a list of all the important men .
I haven't come to steal your loyalty , friends .
Gracious brother , I will go with them .
Why should I be afraid of your judgment when I haven't done anything wrong ?
It's Mercutio's relative , noble Count Paris !
The things men are allowed to do !
Cleopatra recognizes your greatness and accepts your authority .
Yes , gentle cousin , if it were light enough for you .
Why are you going crazy over these trashy clothes ?
What's going on ?
I may command the one I love." Well , she commands me .
She deserves to have rocks and stones thrown on her body .
If knives , poison , or snakes have edge , effect , or venom , I am safe from that fate .
Are they likely to get dusty ?
But , oh no !
Dear Mr. Fabian , do me another favor first .
It is a trade , sir , that I practice with a clear conscience .
Go on , tell it .
The man should be inside the lantern .
Other countries criticize us for our loud partying .
I've got a plan that will fix everything .
I do dare , and I say that you are the villain .
To hell with all worn-out horses , all crazy masters , and all bad roads .
The earth has bubbles , just like the water , and these creatures must have come from a bubble in the earth .
And you're not loyal , like us .
Is the news good or bad that you enter without knocking ?
This forest doesn't seem deserted when you're here , because you are all the world to me .
No , come to my cabin .
She stood trembling , then suddenly dropped dead .
His daughters want to kill him .
I think they do .
Come with me to see the duchess .
In that case you should sleep .
Pull only his name out of his heart and let him go .
With whom ?
Yes , Lepidus .
It's certain that she is dead , and she died in a strange way .
You lie , you disgusting tyrant .
You might just as well say , "That's a valiant flea that dares to eat its breakfast on the lip of a lion." Yes , exactly .
No , keep flattery for kissing the hands of those who can pay well .
Just as hounds and greyhounds , mongrels , spaniels , mutts , shaggy lapdogs , swimming dogs , and wolf-dog crossbreeds are all dogs .
Go ahead .
That wicked Jew got the duke to listen to his complaints .
A false conclusion .
The sister of my wife , this lady here , is married to your son .
He's too argumentative for me .
Or in the power of reason .
Is my father well ?
But where's my fool ?
Well , death is the end for everybody .
Go to the platform , Brutus .
You say you're a better soldier .
I told him to knock at your gate and for the life of me could not get him to do it .
Come , trusty sword .
Like a mouse caught in my own trap , Osric .
Othello ?
The English army is near , led by Malcolm , his uncle Siward , and the good Macduff .
Where's Potpan ?
You there , sir , come here please .
Give me that boy and I'll come with you .
Very well , thank you .
What would you like , sir ?
Who's calling me ?
Stop , Sir Toby !
You'll see that Caesar is giving you no reason to do so .
If I know my own thoughts and desires , and I'm not dreaming or crazy , which I'm sure I'm not , then , dear uncle , I've never had so much as a half-formed thought that would have offended you .
Listen !
Yes , even power gets in its own way .
I'll tell you what , Prince : a whole university full of wisecrackers couldn't change my mood today .
But I wish I could say that's the last time he'll do it !
Is it all come to this ?
This was the noblest Roman of them all .
Agreed .
Oh no !
This is exactly how she always looks , and , I swear it , she is fast asleep .
I will , sir .
Hello , sir .
I'll tear her to pieces !
Oh , darling Orlando , it's so hard to see you wearing your heart in a sling .
The wit you flaunt is like a blunt sword , it can't hurt anyone , thank God. , My lord , I thank you for your many kindnesses .
He got there too late .
No , it would be better to speak first and kiss only after you've run out of things to say .
I've done a bad thing , for which I will blame myself so much that I'll never be happy again .
Besides , the king's name is a tower of strength ; the opposition doesn't have that advantage .
How can you be out of breath when you have enough breath to tell me that you're out of breath ?
That I won't stand for .
I'll give the first one , Pompey .
As king of this country I like to reward wit when I hear it .
Poor lady , she'll go crazy when she sees it's missing .
You're Lear's shadow .
What a poor instrument , that can do such a noble deed !
The prince has far outgrown me .
Meet me in a little while at the citadel .
Let's go , Nerissa. ,
My master is the great and rich Capulet , and if you don't belong to the house of Montague , please come and drink a cup of wine .
Pay attention to the music .
Stanley , pay attention to your wife's doings .
Whip him , fellows , until he screws up his face like a baby and cries aloud for mercy !
All I'll tell you is that the duke has had dinner already .
Play , trumpets !
Whatever kind you want , I guess .
If my eyes don't deceive me , you are my daughter .
I think it was at sea .
A hundred and sixty-eight hours ?
Oh Romeo , Romeo , brave Mercutio is dead !
You mean , to bear me , not to bear My protector , Richard , insists on it .
I'll try talking to him again .
Oh , then I see you've been with Who's Queen Mab ?
Come here , Ventidius .
Very well .
He feels the need to grace all his other tramps with his presence while I sit at home starving for a smile from him .
Oh , lying woman !
He leaps from the ground as if his insides were light as hairs .
Listen , Hortensio .
Go to your bedroom .
What , you ?
Why should we do this ?
hundred times .
Please come in .
They will tell me more , because I'm determined to know the worst about what's going to happen .
The same to you , my lord !
How could you ask ?
I wish they'd fight in fire or in the air .
We should definitely say something to the Moor .
There's justice in heaven after all !
And women .
Okay , to the point .
Never apologize , when the actors are all dead , no one can be blamed .
You'll be sorry later , but it'll be too late .
And I'm expecting his reproach .
Yes , a dozen of them , as many as there are women in the world , in fact .
Come , come , I know what you're referring to , Richard .
Gentlemen , stand up .
Ah , my good old friends !
Give me my money and let me go .
Yes .
By my birth I rank above you , but don't be afraid of my greatness .
No thank you , my lord .
Those trumpets are calling us in to dinner .
I see a woman may be made a fool of if she doesn't have nerve enough to stand up for herself .
I swear to God , madam , you've wronged me , and I'll tell the whole world .
Then love me , Rosalind .
If she's lying , I pray that I never sleep again at night or wake up during the day .
Gentleman , I am not the same man I was before .
Because if that's the case , I will tell you a plan that will get rid of your enemy and bring you closer to me .
It's a reason for suspicion , even though it's just a dream .
He's changed a great deal .
Is it not enough , is it not enough , young man , that I'll never be pretty enough to get a kind look from Demetrius ?
I guess now she's going to be my sister-in-law and not my wife .
That's not fair .
God forbid that I should prevent sacred devotion !
Harder , harder .
To find you .
Soon all my work will be done , and you'll be free .
Tell us what happened today that put Caesar in such a serious mood .
Or do you want me to criticize her like I do all women ?
You liar , you're turning my heart to stone , and making me call what I'll do murder , when I had been thinking of it as a sacrifice !
If she admits she wanted this , then I won't blame Othello. , Come here , my child .
If I had seen something like that , I would have quickly pulled out my weapon .
That's not necessary .
But how ?
Please wait .
Please , please tell me !
But I see you're troubled .
Peter !
No , afterward .
It's been longer , it's been longer .
That's how you'll talk about me when you're in this mood .
I hate to say it , but it's almost two and we won't get there before suppertime .
I'm sorry , you were saying ?
Just as bad , my lord .
My lady ordered me to deliver her letter .
Swaggering ?
He'll come right away .
If my heart's dear love , Well , don't swear .
I wish you'd never met him .
That's the way of the world .
Let them in .
It's the same with men .
What news ?
This is the place .
Yes , it's just clothing .
Just one glass .
Tell us how it happened , noble Casca .
Oh , oh !
It is .
I'm tired of it , and you say you're tired of it too .
In any case , our survival depends on putting together the strongest force possible .
I can't ask you to make my daughter live , that's impossible , but I beg you both to tell the people of Messina that she was innocent when she died .
My father instructed you in his will to give me a good education .
I can see in your eyes there's been some good news .
Cassio's a good friend of mine , My lord , I can see you're upset .
Your mother is coming to your bedroom .
I wish you could tell him I saved his brother .
Well , it's a fault I wouldn't trade for your best virtue .
Juno and Ceres are whispering about something serious .
Oh , forgive me !
From Silvius , sir .
Your Grace does me as great an honor as could be wished by any of his subjects .
Not us .
Yes , my lord .
No , not a chance .
Like an invitation .
We'll rise and leave early tomorrow .
Why did this have to happen now ?
If you choose that one , I'm yours , along with the picture .
Why is Time so cheap about giving out hair ?
If he said that , then I hope his malicious soul rots in hell forever .
Then who took my letter to Romeo ?
On the condition that your sister's son , Publius , also must die , Mark Antony .
Tell me once more what you say .
Thank you .
Good lord !
Fight to the death" is his motto .
If you're a virgin , you'll answer this question .
Yes , she's young and tender .
Cruel , cruel Death killed her .
Othello , I've been seriously hurt .
He must be wearing this crazy outfit for some reason .
I hope for my brother's sake that he just wrote it to test my honor .
But where's the money ?
His counselors will govern as long as he's a minor , and then he'll take over .
My father loved Sir Rowland as much as he loved his own soul , and the rest of the world shared my father's opinion .
Oh !
Why , you're absolutely right , cousin .
Exactly like that .
They killed my children too ?
Don't hurt me , please .
Stop right now or I'll throw your dagger over the roof .
But they aren't .
And so I'm dying .
Can we do that ?
Help !
Oh God , Benedick will plague him like a disease !
Come on .
Enough of your magic spells , you hateful , withered hag .
Are you so pious that you would pray for this man and his children , a man who has pushed you toward an early grave and put your family in poverty forever ?
That's merciful but a bit careless .
I was just knocking to see if anyone was home .
Murder , murder !
They probably received warning about how much I stirred up the people .
And you , sir , what's Well , compared to a fine workman , you might call me a mere cobbler .
Thomas , the earl of Surrey , and he were moving from troop to troop around twilight cheering up the soldiers .
Stop it , I order you .
So good-bye for now .
Truly , madam , I don't hear anything .
Let it go .
Come , come , you weak , ungovernable worms !
And I am Brutus , Marcus Brutus .
Actually , I'd like a few pounds of grass .
She was so young , but she deceived her father so thoroughly he thought it was witchcraft !
Send your man away .
Carry them away .
By God , it does look like a camel .
Sir , I believe this piece of trash , Bianca , has something to do with all this trouble. , Hang in there , Cassio. , Come here , bring the light .
Ha , ha , ha !
Jailer , watch out for this one .
You're using this as an excuse for not showing up at the Porcupine like you promised .
Ha , ha , ha !
What , you don't want me to be chaste ?
Kiss her soft mouth , and we'll be off .
As a favor to I'm delighted .
If you don't like him you should quit .
Don't miss our feast .
The boy is warning me that someone approaches .
In this wicked world , criminals often take the money they stole and use it to buy off the law , shoving justice aside .
Why are you still crying ?
I'll do any decent thing , my lord , to help my cousin get a good husband .
Michael Cassio , lieutenant of the Moor Othello , has arrived on shore .
Now I know better .
Wait , don't stand next to each other .
Claim fair England's peace depends on this alliance .
Tell him I'm sick .
He is taking care of it as we speak .
The pound of flesh that I want from him was very expensive .
And still do , I swear by my hands .
But I know why a snail carries its house on its back .
The merchandise you bring from Rome is too expensive for me .
Sadness takes away our color .
If I'm lying , then
I've had enough of this "off with you ! " Come on , let me in !
But will my Rosalind do this , too ?
And I departed in a rage , right ?
The watchdogs bark .
My dear friends , thanks for your patience .
Wait for me there .
By God , I will tell the king about these taunts .
You're brave gentlemen .
I'll be able to see better from that pine tree over there .
Come , bring me to them .
Bring her out , brother .
You look too much like the ghost of Banquo .
If he shows up tomorrow , I'll give him what's coming to him .
Spoken like a brave man who respects his reputation .
Where is he ?
My lord ?
Well , start thinking about marriage now .
I'll keep my promise just as if you really were Rosalind .
He rejected my authority as much as yours .
Thank you , Ariel .
I would like to prove to you that I am .
May my wrinkles forbid that !
Likewise , I'm young , and my sense of reason has just ripened .
The fight is between our masters , and we men who work for them .
What time is it ?
Come , sisters , let's cheer him up and show him our talents .
But Angelo , you'll pay for this , even if it costs all the precious metals in your jewelry shop .
They say you are a melancholy fellow .
I'm going on alone .
But she loves it so much ( since Othello told her she should always keep it with her ) that she always keeps it near her to kiss it and talk to it .
Not so fast .
Who is to blame for this : Antony or I ?
Delay this marriage for a month , or a week .
If she's a traitor , why then , so am I .
Come on , what did Romeo say ?
Here comes the herald of the French , my liege .
Weren't we both born under Taurus ?
Let's go !
I saw him holding the handkerchief !
We want Antony taken alive .
It's best to rehearse there , because if we do it here in the city , we'll be bothered by crowds of people and everyone will know the plot of our play .
Lord Edmund didn't speak to your master at home ?
Come on , get ready .
At that exact moment , Titania woke up and immediately fell in love with him , an ass .
Here .
That woman who claims I am her husband , I loathe her in my soul .
You are only a soldier .
No , before !
Are you sitting around in this humiliation to amuse yourself ?
Well , then , we're awake .
Those are her orders .
Believe it .
Yes , at Philippi .
I think it's my bad eyesight that's making me see this horrible vision .
I wouldn't change it except to make you think of me , my darling queen .
Ha !
Surely , Luciana , it's already two o'clock .
Leave me alone for a minute .
The crows flying down below look as small as ants .
It's possible , ma'am .
Farewell , farewell !
Affection ! " That's nothing !
He's married to Octavia .
What a long night this is !
Here he comes back .
What , are you busy ?
Let the rain spray !
That's true .
On that point , our letters don't agree .
Please stop , sir .
I'd rather they killed me than have to live without your love .
I wish you were someone else's son .
And we'll leave together , like friends .
The two of us will guard you while you sleep , my lord , and keep you safe .
What is my nation ?
I have no idea how .
Do you have permission to go out and take confession today ?
Go quickly , hurry , to the castle , for I've given orders to have Lear and Cordelia killed .
As for me , I welcome my good luck with sadness .
She said she loved me for the dangers I'd survived , and I loved her for feeling such strong emotions about me .
Did he charge interest ?
Welcome .
Never contradict him .
Is your name William ?
Believe me , then , that I have special powers .
Look at them .
No , follow him now , before he divulges the prank and ruins everything .
I'm as crazy as he is , if sad craziness and happy craziness are equivalent .
That our grandmother's soul could end up inhabiting a bird .
Who's that ?
She is worse than wicked .
Oh , Lord !
Give my compliments to your lady .
Farewell .
Remember me .
No , sir .
Captain Jamy is a wonderfully valorous gentleman , that's certain , one with great learning and knowledge concerning ancient warfare , I happen to know from his maneuvers .
That can't be .
But honestly , I should have been a woman .
This letter from Bellario introduces us to a young and well-educated legal expert .
What do you want from me ?
Hey , lady !
Pay me three times the amount of the loan and let the Christian go .
Oh bloody Richard !
I'll look at him and try to like him , at least if what I see is likable .
The devil's after me !
Are you sure we're awake ?
Petruchio ?
You have seen the cruel proof of this man's strength .
What do you say ?
My comfort is that old age , that poor preserver of beauty , can't make my face any worse than it already is .
How can that be ?
All right , go ahead , keep up your little game , pretend to be sympathetic , but then nudge each other and wink and make faces at me when I turn my back .
Make a bug show of mourning for her , hang sad epitaphs up at your family's tomb , and perform all the appropriate burial ceremonies .
I should have reprimanded you then for not bringing it , but you started fighting with me first .
You go and talk to the duke so he won't notice I'm helping the king .
It's almost five o'clock .
You're smiling ?
What does he say ?
No .
Isn't that him heading this way ?
You're a man ?
Take your penalty .
So farewell , all , for my tongue has almost finished with its life .
If your highness is willing , take revenge on him for that , because I know you're brave enough , I don't dare to , That's for sure .
But here comes a scoundrel who says he saw me at the marketplace and that I beat on him , told him I'd given him a thousand marks in gold , and then lied about my wife and my house .
I thank you all for your trouble and courtesy .
I should be ridiculed if I were offended so easily , and laughed at even more for speaking of you disrespectfully , when I had no reason to speak of you at all .
Please stand up !
And you'll speak on the same platform as I do , after I'm done .
Oh , it's dreadful , dreadful , Iago !
What , here in the middle of the street ?
Can you remember the time before you came to live in this shack ?
Oh , " he said , "Did you fall on your face ?
That part is up to you .
When I could see , I didn't always see clearly .
How ?
I'd be very grateful to you if you did .
The most important thing for you to think about is how beautiful his daughter is .
Good , I'm satisfied .
Come on , do you think I can't recognize you by your excellent wit ?
Right or not , it's made you the Earl of Gloucester .
Are you trying to remake me ?
Please calm down , uncle .
Let this evil hour be marked forever in the calendar as cursed .
Where's my father ?
Let your anger fall on me then , even if its sharpness pierces my heart .
Some are born great , some achieve greatness , and some have greatness thrust upon them .
Leonato's daughter had told us everything .
Yes , you're absolutely right about how worthy Brutus is and how much we need him .
Then if he dies , his death serves him .
Do you want to exchange fathers ?
I'll tell you this , Constable , my mistress has his own hair .
It doesn't sound as sweet as it did before .
Look !
Well , we'll stop , then .
Regan , is that what you said ?
So , the sun won't shine today !
So think carefully about what you want , beautiful Hermia .
So , perhaps , did yours .
Oh yes , sir , I have often been to Pisa , Pisa , City of Wise Men .
She is banished .
The treacherous weapon is right in your hand , sharp and dipped in poison .
If everything else fails , at least I have the power to take my own life .
What are you talking about , man ?
We hope your poison has worn off and this day shall transform all grievances and quarrels into friendship .
I insist , don't be more distressed than I am .
I wouldn't insult him in my own house for all the wealth in this town .
I'll drink as much as you do !
And how do you like Lord Bassanio's wife ?
Amen .
Show .
Goodnight , Michael .
Wasn't it just yesterday that we spoke to each other ?
Shame on you , you slanderer !
Whatever you want , I made it for you .
Bring out the stocks !
And you haven't heard any news about her in your letters ?
All right , have it your way .
If you don't repay me on the day we agree on , in the place we name , for the sum of money fixed in our contract , your penalty will be a pound of your pretty flesh , to be cut off and taken out of whatever part of your body I like .
I shook you and shouted at you , sir .
Go immediately , and do exactly as I wrote down .
I can't talk about my happiness anymore .
Look at me now !
Sing it tonight .
I've been practicing fencing constantly since he went off to France .
Yes , you did , sir .
Put the torch out , so I can't be seen .
It's too late .
Find him and tell him to come here .
And when you get married , I hope I can be married at the same time .
It would be just like a nice daydream or fantasy .
In any case , Antonio assured the duke they weren't with Bassanio on his ship .
God , help us not be jealous !
Don't you
My sword will talk for me .
She'll fall madly in love with the first thing she sees when she wakes up , even if it's a lion , a bear , a wolf , a bull , a monkey , or an ape .
And I your servant .
In emergencies you meet the strangest folks .
Take me by the hand and say , "Harry of England , I am yours." No sooner shall I hear that word than I will tell you straight out , "England is yours , Ireland is yours , France is yours , and Harry Plantagenet
What then ?
This epitaph will hang here forever , Continuing to praise Hero after I die .
Is everyone here ?
Lead's too crass to hold her .
Let's go inside .
Let the world collapse around us .
I enchanted them so thoroughly that they followed me through thorn bushes and prickly shrubs that tore up their shins .
He said he was going to buy me a necklace , but I never saw it .
But if it is a sin to be selfish about honor , I am the most guilty soul alive .
Now , now , both of you gentlemen !
It was .
There's my dagger Put away your dagger .
If a ship's leaving , come to the marketplace .
I told them to take Oh , what a big mistake !
My darling Othello !
In two months , a month before this loan is due , I expect to earn more than three times that much from my investments .
In my desperate situation , I have to act alone .
No , it's certain , Iras .
Sir John Falstaff .
Duke , the abbess has wronged me and I seek justice .
Bathe his filthy head with warm , scented water .
I'll wait over here .
Can you help me ?
Oh God , Iago , what can I do to win my husband back again ?
Everything depends on this : either be out of here before the night watchmen take their positions , or leave in disguise after daybreak .
I'm your daughter .
Amen .
I'll agree to those terms and even say that Jews are nice .
I humbly thank you .
No one , Brutus , no one .
Hermia's not holding onto me anymore .
Easy , Petruchio .
I only want idiots following my advice , the advice of a fool .
Where are they ?
She's too beautiful and too wise to deserve heaven's blessing by making me despair .
Everything we've heard is bad .
But I promise you , Kate : the older I grow the better I'll look .
The Prince's fool" !
Get the lady out of here .
When I meet this gentleman , I'll tell him what you've said .
I think it's important .
The general and his wife are talking about it now , and she's defending you strongly .
Maud , Bridget , Marian , Ciceley , Gillian , Ginn !
What , we're going to die ?
That's already been done , sir .
I'd try it , if I could cry "hem" and have him .
What's that noise ?
Think about it .
I thank you very much on his behalf .
I admit I'm only a woman , but I'm still a woman from a noble family , I'm Cato's daughter .
We used to think so too .
It just appeared before them and marched past them with slow dignity three times , a staff's distance from their amazed eyes , while they turned , quaking with fear and too shocked to speak .
One of us will stay and stand guard .
I haven't seen anything .
That'll keep them from being afraid .
Here comes Catesby again .
Yes , my lord ?
Let's get out of here .
Onward , lover boys !
Oh do-de , do-de , do-de .
As for Michael Cassio , I think it would be safe for me to swear that he's honest .
I wouldn't be the villain you think I am even if I were offered all of Macbeth's kingdom and the riches of the East too .
Find out who did it !
Give me your hand and let me see you dressed in woman's clothing .
What's all that shouting about ?
I'll give it back to you .
I can confirm that all these shocking things are true .
What a man , young lady .
So go .
Don't shed even one tear .
Unless you can also teach me how to forget my banished father , you shouldn't try to teach me how to be happy .
Yes , and a brave one , who dares to look at something that would frighten the devil .
See , ladies , how they scorn me now .
Let go of my hand .
I don't trust you .
Yes , right away .
But please , father , the question is still nagging at me , why did you conjure up this storm ?
The sun will never be seen by such royal eyes again .
I'd rather have a jester to make me happy than experience to make me sad , and to travel for all that trouble , no less !
I'm sure you know him .
Farewell .
Ah , don't tear yourself away from me !
I say he shall go to prison .
No .
I'd rather die .
I'll cry my tears for Romeo's banishment when their tears are dry .
You know where she is .
As a friend .
No , girl !
And this is all because of our argument .
Anything I did to you , I did it because Sir Toby made me .
Stop , brave lady , stop !
How's it going ?
It's nice you're offering to sacrifice her behind her back .
But I'll get you a candle and paper and ink .
If arguing makes us sweat , the real trial will turn that water to blood .
That way , the maiden that stood between me and them shall be the means of my achieving my desire .
No , not me , sir .
You've come right on time .
Good to see you , Iago .
What's your name ?
I'll call you "Hamlet Senior , " "King , " "Father , " "royal Dane." Answer me !
God bless you , my friend , and your music too .
To that end , I presented him with the tennis balls , the perfect expression of his inexperience and frivolity .
Though our lives , We have decided , my lord .
It's easier to rule a third of the world than a wife like that .
Then I'll listen to her .
How dare I ?
Give me my sin back .
You , my earthly moon , are now eclipsed , and that alone foretells my ruin .
Tell me that I'll marry three kings before noon and be widowed by all of them .
Why not ?
Help me !
Our guiding light is out .
I won't take it back .
It's a pity that fools aren't allowed to speak wisely about the foolish things that wise men do .
I'm going to ask her to let me talk to Desdemona .
Stay and speak !
Is this possible ?
I'll tell you before you have to ask me again .
The captain , give it to the captain .
Come , sit , sit , and sing me a song .
Knock .
But look , even if my dishes are poor , eat them with my best wishes .
Well , even if he is her father , I'm sure she wouldn't want to have the head of the old man on her shoulders !
He's a proper count , that Count Sugarplum , a sweet gentleman , for sure !
You really don't recognize me , father ?
I've decided on a plan that doesn't require your assistance .
There was no Signior Montanto in our army .
Indeed , my lord , he is a perfectly wonderful horse .
But not in heaven .
There's no place I'd rather die than here by Caesar , and no manner of death would please me more than being stabbed by you , the masters of this new era .
Go on .
Yes .
It was just an accident !
God should keep me from false friends , but they weren't false .
Leave Hermia alone .
Give me that letter , sir .
But I never spoke the whole time ?
May I only do well in these dangerous battles if my intention to repent and prosper is sincere !
I can't tell who's who .
I'm telling you , Aliena , I can't stand being apart from Orlando .
But goodbye .
Now is the time when we need your help .
Oh , really ?
It was I , in fact , whom you promised to strike .
With no more ceremony than that ?
But all of you , remember what you've said and prove yourselves true Romans .
I'm happy the Dauphin has such a good sense of humor .
I've changed my mind now and partly believe in omens .
Make peace with God , for you must die , my lord .
He'll bring a lot of money to the person who owns him , that's for sure .
Romeo will thank you , my girl , for both of us .
This is our station .
Remorseless , treacherous , sex-obsessed , unnatural villain !
I sent Dromio to you with money for bail , but I don't think he brought it to you .
Are the others waiting ?
Go inside , Nerissa .
children have lost , or no longer have time to learn , skills that should be a credit to our country .
With all my heart .
You've come to face a ruthless enemy , an inhuman wretch incapable of pity , without any feelings of mercy .
He hasn't arrived yet .
How can you top that ?
A soldier is just a tool , like his sword , unless he has your qualities , Ventidius .
Farewell .
Whenever you're ready , hostess .
I am dying , Cleopatra , dying .
To invite my former boss , the Jew , to dine tonight with my new master , the Christian .
It's almost morning , but I'm sure you're not fully satisfied about what happened .
Me too .
Then right next to him I saw the murderers , dripping with blood , their daggers rudely covered in gore .
No , the one I gave you .
Is this your idea of success ?
You go ahead , and I will follow you .
Come on , then .
Wait a minute , gentlemen .
He doesn't have to care .
Shylock , although I never lend or borrow with interest , I'm willing to break that habit to help a friend in need .
My beautiful Rosalind , I'm only an hour late .
But how ?
God be good to you !
His courage is hidden , and when it is revealed , it will shrink .
Why ?
In a time like this , it doesn't make sense to criticize every offense .
and patches of righteousness .
Besides , how have I offended you , my friends ?
Turn right at the next turn , but at the following turn , turn left .
All the worse that she stooped this low , then .
Hymen brought her from heaven Yes , brought her here .
What's important is to be prepared .
But it doesn't matter .
But give them all a good dinner and look after them well .
But come on , inconsistent young man , come with me .
You can see my ribs so well you can count them .
I'll either fight you , Macbeth , or else I'll put down my sword unused .
Oh my , my bones ache so much .
Am I in France ?
Come on , you're a fool , and driven to extreme measures by love .
Tomorrow , while it's still early , I will go see the witches .
Has your heart cooled toward me ?
He's right over there .
Here's what you'll do .
I have a good eye , uncle .
Don't go , " says my conscience .
I had to send it to him .
Here comes Kent .
By next week , I'll be able to pay you .
You may leave .
I swear by this hand that I love you .
The Venetians are waiting for their food .
But if you believe everything they say , you won't be saved by half of what they do .
It would be wonderfully wise of you , my dear Reynaldo , to ask around about his behavior a little before you visit him .
Tell your master there is no sound basis for his worries .
Say that it's my fear that keeps you inside and not your own .
All other devils who tempt people to treason patch together some motive , put together from shreds
When a great person departs , it causes more pain than when the soul leaves the body .
Is the duke of Exeter safe ?
What news can you tell me in this fast-moving , unsteady state of ours ?
It's nice to see children playing well together .
Who are the people who want to speak with me ?
Well , I'll commit the sin of double-dealing , and deal you a second coin .
Casca will tell us what's the matter .
My servants might overhear , and old Gremio is still hanging around , so we might be interrupted .
Just remember who you've got on board with you , good man .
She's a virtuous and holy lady .
The Lord Grandpre .
Where are you from ?
Mark Antony is in your tents , my lord .
I didn't refuse you .
And if you rattle on about mountains , then let them throw millions of acres over us .
Don't waste any time .
Pyramus is coming up to the wall .
A lot of words .
Come , Dromio , let's go .
They're friends , Ratcliffe and Lovell .
Now go !
His majesty is so concerned about my personal safety that he has ordered them to conduct me to the You're being arrested ?
Then the wrong man is dead , and sweet revenge has gone wrong .
Oh , then I guess she was old and gentle , and you rode barelegged , like an Irish yokel .
I can't talk now .
Am I myself ?
Officer , I'll take the responsibility from you , and the blame too .
You're not going to take him .
Snakes shed their skin there , and the shed skin is wide enough to wrap a fairy in .
It's hell in our house , and you helped cheer it up , like a funny devil .
Mistress , your father requests that you leave your books and come help decorate your sister's room .
What a day this is !
When the forked blue lightning seemed to break open the sky , I put myself right where I thought it would hit .
It is written that shoemakers and tailors should play with each others ' tools , that fisherman should play with paints , and painters should play with with fishing nets .
If he's been killed , say "Yes." If not , say "No." These short words will determine my joy or my pain .
So , goodbye .
So , are you done ?
Call him in .
By God , your doors were locked and you were shut out .
I've gotten it dirty , ashes to ashes , and dust to dust .
It's not earlier than that , I tell you .
Oh , dainty duck !
Imagine , me , a drunk !
Fever , as we know , is a kind of madness .
And when you married him and made him the master of your bed , I gave you my word that I would do everything I possibly could for him .
Yes , and he's been carried off the field .
I'll look over the inscriptions again .
You'll find me ready enough to do that , sir , if you give me a reason .
And Benedick is not the worst husband I can think of .
All the most beautiful paintings Are black when compared to Rosalind .
About as old as you are , my lord .
Come here , herald. , Let the trumpet sound ! , Read this out .
By this sword , I'll kill whichever one of you makes the first thrust .
You don't really love me .
I can't live by pretending anymore .
Oh , that's not true , my lord .
Miserable England , I foresee for you the most frightening time you have ever experienced. , Come , lead me to the block .
It's good if you love Hero , because she's worthy of your love .
Who were you chasing with your sword ?
Ha !
I need to hear the truth about all this .
As I get to leech him , I will show some mercy .
Have you given up so quickly on Rosaline , whom you loved so much ?
But it's true , I don't want to get all mushy and go on and on , but the good Antonio , the honest Antonio , oh , if I only had a title good enough to match his ! , Come on , get to the point .
He's not sick , my lord , but he's very upset , and his problems are serious .
Fifteen years !
Help !
Therefore , do your duty and take your reward , because my master and mistress are nearly frozen to death .
Damn it all !
You are , but you don't know it yet .
He took aim at a beautiful young virgin who was sitting on a throne in the western part of the world , and he shot his arrow of love well enough to have pierced a hundred thousand hearts .
Why did you once seem lovely to me ?
Am I your servant ?
Listen , Guildenstern , and you too , Rosencrantz , listen as close as you can !
Did you call me , my lord ?
Arrest him : he's a friend of the duke of Alencon's .
Who offered him the crown ?
Don't you see my baby suckling at my breast so that its nurse will fall asleep ?
What will this do ?
Then die and be damned !
I've been singing ever since you made your daughters into your mothers by giving them all your power .
Oh , be quiet .
It seems he has taken great care to please his wife .
It bothers me , though , that these poor spotted innocents , who , after all , are this deserted city's native citizens , should be gouged with arrows .
I had come to the deepest part of my tale , and I planned to say nothing more on the topic .
You will be exhibited in Rome along with me , like Egyptian puppets .
They'll be here tomorrow or the next day .
Spirit , we have to get ready to meet with Caliban .
What are you doing with a sword ?
Just as the ox has his yoke , the horse its bridle , the falcon a tether , a man has his desires , to keep in check .
Welcome home , Grumio .
Treason !
The thing is definitely going to be sold .
Gentlemen , on to the bridal dinner .
Cassio was wrong to hurt Montano , who was only trying to help him , but I'm sure the guy who ran away must have offended Cassio in some terrible way , and Cassio couldn't let it pass .
Now let's sit closely around this candle and discuss our needs .
According to an agreement , I should wear it myself .
Yes , we're the privates in her army .
He received Caesar's letters , and he is coming .
I'm off , my lord .
Bassanio , let him have the ring .
Ha !
Gentlemen , let's go make sure Cassio's wounds are properly dressed. , Come on , ma'am , you can tell us another story .
I have already .
The next hailstone should hit Caesarion , until one by one all my children , and every one of my brave Egyptians , are killed by the dissolving of this pellet storm and lie unburied , covered by gnats and flies .
I go over hills and valleys , through bushes and thorns , over parks and fenced-in spaces , through water and fire .
He is worth no more than that .
For the love of God , help us !
What color is her hair ?
He's in Athens , my lord .
Quiet !
Now , I swear , I'm so angry that I'm shaking all over .
Curse the day this happened , but it did .
I'll take you and your wonderful virtues here and now , if it's okay that I'm picking up what others have thrown away .
Oh my God , what a terrible world this is !
Medicine is for the dogs .
Everyone knows that when you pour a drink out of a cup and into a glass , the cup becomes empty .
I've noticed that they always like to settle and mate where the air is the nicest .
I wouldn't either , by daylight .
You can't do that .
I wish I could repay this happy news with good news of my own .
That's an oath of great power , and our fury must subside .
All right , then .
Well , well , well .
Charles , I thank you for your loyalty to me , and you'll see that I'll reward you .
Now talk to him in your own voice , and tell me how he is .
I'll just stay here till the storm passes .
Believe that you are a foolish little baby for believing these "offers" are something real .
Oh , my son , my son !
By God , I wouldn't lose as much honor as a single man more would cost me , I think , not even if it meant giving up my best hope for victory .
I doubt it .
Who's there ?
Let me take my chances .
There was a noise , that's certainly true .
Mistress , both the man and his master are possessed .
The British forces are on their way here .
You haven't lost it unless you think you have .
Look , here comes the duke .
What is it ?
So you want to put a man in your belly .
True .
You think she gave it to Cassio ?
I'm not much of a drinker .
Good-bye , great commander .
So , without further ado , the best thing to do now is probably just to shake hands and go our separate ways .
Stand away from the body .
Oh !
I'll lie down here and measure out my grave .
You're not leaving the house today .
My baby hawk ?
Oh heaven , oh earth , witness what I'm about to say , and reward me if I tell the truth !
Do you want to go in and join the party ?
Oh , I've heard him talk about that brother , and he described him as the most inhumane man alive .
Bring the villain forward .
Strange things are about to happen , Edmund .
I love you with so much of my heart that none of it is left to protest with .
My name's Stephano , and I've come to tell you my mistress will arrive here at Belmont before sunrise .
Oh my , what's the news ?
Go .
And how was that one settled ?
Oh , a footstep as light as hers will never endure the rocky road of life .
Ever since Cordelia left for France , sir , the fool has been depressed .
Before you make My lord , you could really help me out now .
Ask her to help you heal the rift between her husband and you .
My lord , I'll say goodbye now .
Or maybe I've got a hankering for a bundle of hay .
So you're saying you're not a whore ?
He's laughing already !
No doubt the murderous knife was blunt till it was sharpened on your stony heart , you reveled in my lambs ' bloody guts .
I'm begging you , tell me who it is quickly , and speak fast .
Look , it's the Prince and Mr. Love .
He's given me a second life , and marrying her makes him a second father to me .
I guess it's only one man , no big deal .
But Edward is still alive .
Come , I'll place you among the sisterhood of holy nuns .
The Prince will give you the death penalty if you get caught .
Le Roy ?
My father's studying hard , so he won't see you .
A hundred then .
Why have you gotten so rude ?
You've stunned him .
Is your master coming ?
You see how kind everyone is to us , how they just hand us gold .
Run to the Capulets .
Does that mean he's lazy ?
Kate , my wooing is fit for your understanding : I am glad your English isn't better .
Your friend , Artemidorus." I'll stand here until Caesar passes by , and I'll give him this as though it's a petition .
Are you any kind of philosopher yourself , shepherd ?
Where are you coming from ?
I overlooked your request , but I did not deny it .
Your request came at a time when the poisonous effects of reveling caused me to be unaware of my own actions .
Let's not talk about it .
Let me be captured .
You are dead !
A grandmother is loved hardly less than a mother is .
I was his daughter when you banished him .
Good morning to all these lovely people .
My dear Caius , I'll explain the task at hand to you as we walk toward the man we must do it to .
The highest-ranking ?
Tybalt's death would be bad enough if that was all .
Now the time is right for us to speak , and we do so with imperial authority .
There is an emergency I must take care of , but my whole heart will remain here with you .
Then you are damned .
Too bad about the son !
Your brother is young and inexperienced , and because of my affection for you , I'd hate to crush him , though I'd have to , if he challenged me .
The table's full .
Some of you go to Decius's house and some to Casca's .
Made it for me ?
Well , I'm not sorry to hear that , because they have always been my enemies .
Your lord knows what I think .
What's that music ?
You promised to take a full year off my sentence .
That's a lame threat from a toy gun , a poor individual's private displeasure with a monarch .
Pompey has a strong navy .
Yes , it faded away when the rooster crowed .
Sweet marjoram .
I felt like skipping school , sir .
I think we know whose fancy handwriting that was .
Here he comes with Captain Jamy , the Scots captain .
Yeah , right , go get him .
Well , well , let's go .
Hey !
She's not feeling well .
What , you don't say a word ?
I'm going inside to think up some way to kill that beautiful devil .
Is it lost ?
The woman who might have blocked you from all the murders you've committed by strangling you in her cursed womb .
He's left them to you and to your heirs forever , public pleasures in which you will be able to stroll and relax .
But has Catesby gone ?
And so farewell .
I ask that none of you leave , except myself , until Antony has finished .
You worthless man !
Good Enobarbus !
Let me see you dance .
So , to answer your question .
I see you like to make big offers , sir .
I'm not competitive like Antony .
Nerissa's got the right idea .
Who is this fool ?
What were you before this ?
Are you this impatient ?
Tyranny is dead !
This sight of death is like a bell that warns me I'm old and I'll die soon .
Come with me and I'll get it for you .
Oh , let their bodies follow , my dear king , to win back what's rightfully yours with blood and sword and fire .
But if I am myself , then I know for sure that your weeping sister is not my wife .
He is fortifying his castle at Dunsinane with heavy defenses .
Cheer up , because I think you're going to hell .
I hope that's all he loses .
I need people as trustworthy as you .
In a way , I mean .
Madam , he's well .
Look , he's moving .
No , he means you'll use makeup when you're old .
So here's the plan .
All right then .
Sir , that's well said and well thought out .
But like I said , on the night of Lammas Eve , she will be fourteen .
I'm sure you do .
Who's there ?
Cassio's killed a young Venetian named Roderigo .
They're out to get me , and I won't stand for it !
I tell you , you can use it to get your shoes fixed .
She provoked me with her lying mouth , accusing me of crimes I didn't commit .
That's it !
He's wearing yellow stockings .
How I wish you felt better !
I swear by the heavens , which have grown pale in sympathy with us , I'm going with you , whatever you say .
They can't have changed ; there's no way this could be true .
How did this happen ?
It's good you found me .
I swear to her that I haven't , but it doesn't change anything .
It can not be .
Where are you going ?
You know I'm powerful enough to make you pay for this .
Where do I live ?
What , does the news only get worse ? , Please , Bassanio , I'm half of you , so let me bear half the burden this letter brings you .
Oh , Cassius , I'll run far from this country to where no Romans can find me .
I have walked around the streets , exposing myself to the perilous night , unbuttoned like this , as you see , Casca , baring my chest to the thunderbolt .
She's obedient , a fine lady .
When we're faced with a wretched person , bruised and crying with hardship , we try to get them to shush up .
Don't be scared .
I know my nails are stronger than my eyes ; I'll scratch them out .
Death is my son-in-law .
Are you going to let us in ?
I'm not insulting you .
Shame on you , warped hag !
And why do you blame me for loving you ?
Honestly , I can't .
He gives BIONDELLO Here comes Baptista .
Go , Mardian , and let me know how he reacts to my death .
It wouldn't hurt you to be charitable .
She wants to have a word with you in her bedroom before you go to bed .
Who is so low that he wouldn't ?
Please forgive me , master .
Romeo , come out .
A nice , soft pillow would be a more suitable place to lay that good white head than France's hard , cold ground .
I swear to you , many members of your mustard family have made my eyes water before .
We all begged you not to go ahead with those marriage plans , and your lovely daughter struggled between disgust at marrying an African and the desire to obey you .
And they thought Margaret was Hero ?
Do you know the boy who was just speaking to me ?
While I stood spellbound , messengers from the king arrived and greeted me as the thane of Cawdor , which is precisely how the weird sisters had saluted me before calling me 'the future king !
Let's listen to the moon .
He had no patience .
It was armed , you say ?
But wait a moment .
Not until you pass out .
Madam , you've treated me badly , very badly .
Come over here .
This is unbelievable !
She's not talking to me .
I don't know , and he won't tell me .
My royal kinsman , are you teaching our princess English ?
No doubt , my lord .
The whole world could look at you , and no one would be as blind as he is , thinking you're beautiful .
If that's not enough , I'll sign a contract to pay ten times that much , and I'll give you my hands , my head , and my heart as security .
Keep going , keep going , or I'll declare myself the winner .
And you say he's not jealous ?
He'll release him .
I feel sicker and sicker .
Lay me next to my mistress .
I told him to come back and talk to me in a bit , and he promised he would .
The demon Hoppedance is in Tom's belly , crying for some fish to eat .
Have you heard of me , most noble Empress ?
You should ask instead if it's possible that any criminal could be so rich .
And what am I supposed to do in Illyria ?
have lost , and the indignity we have endured , for which he is too insignificant to sufficiently pay us back .
Oh sirs , consider this : those who sent you to do this deed will hate you for doing it .
I'd rather be a slave or a packhorse for this hateful stablehand here .
Why do you need twenty-five knights , or ten , or even five , when you're staying in a house with a staff of double that at your service ?
And earth !
If you regard it as shameful , put the shame on me .
He's certainly crossed the river Somme .
Lend me your cloak , Sir Thomas .
If I know nothing about pity , that must mean I'm not an animal .
If we crown him , I have to admit we'd be giving him the power to do damage .
My God !
Let my sorrow have the upper hand .
Why , do you know of any harm intended toward him ?
Where's my son Edmund ?
That's why I wish my sister didn't have a name , sir .
Be good enough to take back the same answer I gave before .
I'll show you how kind I am .
Oh , help me , anyone who wants to live long !
What mercy can you show him , Antonio ?
Boy !
You're both very precious to me .
Has he ever tested out these ideas on you before ?
And , Kate , when France is mine and I am yours , then France is yours and you are mine .
That's true .
I have a ship full of treasure .
That's just what I thought .
What he just said to me , it's alright .
Please put up with my weakness .
Have you done everything you could to make him tell you the reason ?
You resent my friends ' rise in society , and my own .
May a plague strike both your houses .
That's what I thought too , sir .
If they refuse to come , get physical , use a whip if you have to , but get them out here to their husbands .
Their dying shouts broke my heart !
Darn it , if I'd guessed he was so brave and such a good swordsman , I never would have challenged him .
What a king Claudius is !
I mean , is the jay more precious than the lark because his feather is more beautiful ?
Also , you're supposed to visit all the bars and tell anyone who's drunk to go home and go to bed .
His speech was like a tangled chain .
No , you're just taunting me .
Yes , my lord .
Her heart is carrying a heavy weight .
Yes , that the king is dead .
Bolstered by righteousness , I prepared to fight , and when he saw my excitement , or perhaps because my shouting scared him , he ran away suddenly .
That's how intense things like love are quickly destroyed .
Yes , you're right , her name is Margery .
Did you see Octavia ?
So be cheerful .
Good , good , I like that , it's only fair !
Don't do this !
Agree to swear .
The other girl did not love me .
Prepare yourselves .
You are a fool. , You , niece , prepare to leave .
Listen , listen !
What do you mean by "carriages" ?
I'll go alone .
What , even you , Brutus ?
I just did my duty , sir .
Come break this up , Benvolio .
The world's huge .
Play , I say !
If only that were all it is , It is , I promise .
Here is the door , sir .
Oh , my dear Cassio !
The Lord Mayor is knocking .
Madam , I am not well .
This news will comfort Cassius .
Cassius , go to the next street and divide the crowd .
See , the snail already has its horns , which prevents nasty rumors from spreading about his wife's infidelity .
Is she as fiery a shrew as they say ?
But his frail heart , too weak to grapple with such a conflict between joy and sadness , gave out .
The Prince and Claudio are supposed to be here by now. , You know your job , brother .
Don't worry about how I handle it .
Keep beating , my heart , and muscles , don't grow old yet , keep me standing .
Therefore you must run , noble Cassius .
I urge you to deliver your verdict .
With a hand like this you need to
Please remember , love .
Stay calm .
So long .
I spoke angry , foul words to him , and with that I will kiss you .
Drowned ?
A gentleman .
How is lieutenant Cassio ?
I , sir , am Dromio .
The hell with her !
Oh , I'd kill that bastard Cassio forty thousand times if I could !
She could even what ?
With those plays in mind , we hope you'll receive this one kindly .
Just let me follow behind you , even though I'm not good enough for you .
Then young men love with their eyes , not with their hearts .
Your father is a sailmaker in Bergamo .
Now I have to leave .
It has hatched a I go unwillingly .
Yes .
I've become an enemy to my own soldiers !
That's him .
You can't get out of trouble by praying or crying , so don't bother .
Please don't take what I said more seriously than it deserves to be taken .
Won't you be glad to see that rascal dog humiliated ?
If you do intend to live , then mourn .
But I'm sure he'll get even with you .
You'd be a pitiful bird .
Who treated you badly ?
But don't keep wondering without more proof .
I wish I knew what is happening .
What's going on , Horatio ?
Kingly power seems most like God's power when the king mixes mercy with justice .
Thank you .
Sir Toby Belch !
They know by those measurements if there will be famine or plenty .
I have been sent on ahead to light a fire , and they are coming after to warm themselves .
Or I'll deliver your insults to his face .
This last course here is for closing up the stomach after great feasting .
That's a step in the direction of love .
Don't imagine that I'll ever allow myself to return to Rome in chains .
He lay there , stretched out like a wounded knight .
God bless you for being here .
No .
She has the patience of a I'll see you hanged on Sunday first !
It's a sweet lozenge that you choke on .
When the time comes , tell the herald to blow the trumpet and I'll return .
On , on , on , on , on !
Stay hidden and listen .
You would be committing a wicked sin by chiding other people for sinning , because you yourself have been a terrible sinner , as carnal in your appetites as lust itself , and all the swollen pustules of sin that you acquired in your freedom you now want to burst and shoot back into the world at large .
Dido was from Carthage , not Tunis .
My wickedness ?
I'm not in the mood .
Get him , he's a thief !
When the poor cried , Caesar cried too .
I'd be peering over maps to figure out the best ports , piers , and waterways .
Have more than you show , Speak less than you know , Lend less than you owe .
Yes , and a nice one at that .
Monday , my lord .
It was some devil .
Go , Sir Andrew .
Don't be afraid .
What do you want ?
Let lightning spit fire !
That's the curse of military service .
Come with us to Athens .
If he hadn't been drunk , he would've really roughed you up .
Want ?
No , Octavius Caesar , we'll respond to their charge .
Go , take it away and let your master make whatever use of it he can .
Seleucus' ingratitude makes me wild .
Let Caesar do whatever he wants .
It's yours .
Come on , Casca , you and I will go see Brutus at his house before sunrise .
Me too , but still , for the sake of good manners , I'll say thanks for your company .
Call the Duke of Burgundy .
The other voice is harsh and abusive .
Is he crazy with love for you ?
Indeed , he's not right for this .
Up here you can't even hear the waves crashing against the rocks .
Let's go there .
If he asks to see me , tell him I'm sick and went to bed .
What performances have been prepared ?
Yes , he is dead .
If things go well , bring the crowd to I'm off .
Listen , will you walk with me around the town and then dine with me at the inn ?
That's right , and then after we fixed the moon , we'd go bird-hunting .
Oh , yes , Benedick has returned and is as cheerful as ever .
Indeed you did , and more besides , Miranda .
She's more cunning than anyone can imagine .
Let him run far away .
Let's not leave him out .
Someone else has the same name , but he's a better man .
You liar , you respond better to the whip than to kindness !
Whether you bite to kill , Mastiff , greyhound , or ugly mutt ,
We're wandering in a maze .
Please , don't be sad , and don't tell me how reluctant you are .
Your case is better than that .
My lady , will you have a dance with me ?
Make me believe it ?
It would be better if you actually applied it to your life .
Ma'am , I'd rather , I know your lady Goneril doesn't love her husband .
But sir , there is no such house , no such maid , and no such men as you have dreamed up , like a certain Stephen Sly and one old John Naps of Greece , a Peter Turph , one "Henry Pimpernell , " and twenty more men of this sort , who never actually existed .
A witty if a cynical reply .
Pish !
Have some patience , please .
Wait .
How is my wife ?
Not the time I saw it .
We'll meet Macbeth there .
To tell the truth , though , I think the duke hasn't lost a single man , except for one who will probably be executed for robbing a church , one Bardolph , I don't know if your Majesty knows the man .
Are you trying to sleep with him ?
It's Casca , I know your voice .
You speak absolutely correctly , sir .
I agree .
I'll meet you there .
Your servants were fighting your enemy's servants before I got here .
He has a ring of mine , worth forty ducats , and he promised to give me a necklace in exchange for it .
Me too .
I love you dearly , Ariel .
And I for Rosalind .
Goodbye .
What looks like a horse is quick as thought disfigured by the wind , made as difficult to distinguish as water poured into water .
Would you rather hear these things from our mouths or from our master's ?
I won't beg the gods to punish you , or caution you to fear their judgment .
Now , welcome , Kate. , And let everyone bear witness that here I kiss her as my sovereign queen .
Where ?
Claribel , his daughter .
Now from head to foot I'm as firm as marble .
Let me just ask her one question , and by your authority as her father , order her to answer truthfully .
Hang on a second .
No , I swear , I don't even know what's in it .
Then let the rain come down .
For shame !
Who can say I mean just her when all her neighbors are exactly like her ?
Where's the Queen ?
Look , it's going away .
It's always like this in times of change .
He'll find out soon what happened in England .
That's five to one .
Come on , I'll escort you to dinner .
Please , fool , go away .
And that's why he went crazy .
Yes , really .
Lepidus flatters both of them , as they flatter him , but he doesn't love them , and they don't love him .
I could not forget you , since I never saw you before in my life .
Now I must return to the wedding .
Listen to what the tyrant says .
Come with us , Lepidus .
Well said !
What power can rein in promiscuous evil once it's gotten rolling ?
We are your servants , your highness , and as always our house and everything in it is at your disposal , for after all , we keep it in your trust and we're glad to give you back what's yours .
There's been a whole debate on the topic .
Now please stop being so strange and tell me what exactly I should blab to my lady .
I think you are .
He's a very proper man .
Knock , knock !
My lord , his throat is cut .
Polite sir , let me say one thing .
The moment they planned to act is almost here .
I want my bond , so stop talking .
What gentleman ?
The East is very seductive .
My name is Thidias .
Very well .
Come on , get ready .
Will you play this recorder ?
Don't worry about me .
If there are any , speak , for it is he whom I have offended .
How do you feel ?
Go back to your lord .
But you're wrong .
I asked you for gold to pay my soldiers , and you wouldn't give it to me .
He's dead .
His face will make the heavens so beautiful that the world will fall in love with the night and forget about the garish sun .
I'll leave you now to chatter and gossip like an old woman .
Damn it !
It's not okay !
Here , take my sword .
I'm not asking you to call her .
Kent can speak rudely when Lear goes mad .
Trebonius !
That's the weakness I'll use to get revenge on him .
Listen !
My lord and brother , God save you .
Good morning , gentlemen .
It's true , they're inconsistent .
So let her execute me .
I only wish I could load him up with all the praise he deserves !
You're acting stupid , Casca , and you lack the quick wits that a Roman should have , or else you don't use them .
Bring that swinger Orlando here .
God help Claudio !
Goodbye .
There's more to it than that. , Ganymede !
Goodbye .
Well , is it not news that Petruchio's coming ?
Oh Ratcliffe , I had a terrifying dream !
From their saddles into the dirt , but that's another story .
What's your business ?
I swear I am .
No , my lord .
Goodbye to the soldiers and to the wars that make men great !
Will you surrender and avoid all this or be called to account for the destruction of this town ?
Oh please , go somewhere else to blab your nonsense .
What does a crocodile look like ?
I'll tell him , my lord .
Be kind now and tell me some excellent fortune .
He made this rope ladder to be a highway to my bed , but I am a virgin , and I will die a virgin and a widow .
But if you live to see yourself similarly denied your rights , this foolish patience will abandon you .
Search high and low , in every acre of the fields , and bring him here for me to see him .
Please , tell my father , madam , I won't marry yet .
I will choose this one and try my chances .
Goneril would go crazy if I chose Regan , but it would be hard to get in with Goneril while her husband's still alive .
We'll watch them starve to death first .
He did touch on women a bit , but his body was aching with fever and he talked about the Whore of Babylon .
This is exactly the false way that verses gallop along .
Stop right now !
Out in the world , I'm like a drop of water , trying to find a drop that matches in the whole wide ocean .
Happy indeed , the way we have spent the day .
Then take this man into your service , Octavius , for he did the final service to my master .
I had a scar here that looked like a "T" ; now it's an "H." They're retreating .
We'll follow you .
Only children are afraid of scary pictures .
Oh , I wish I could know what will happen today before it happens !
Do it now .
I'll go ahead of you , sir .
We want to hear the will .
You insolent rascal , what trade ?
A drum !
So you're telling me to give it time and wait for summer .
Give me your hand .
He's insane .
You're absolutely right , your highness .
Who should begin ?
That's not how I do business .
Now , by my mother's son , and that's me , it will be moon or star or whatever I want before I'll travel to your father's house .
Will you abandon such gentle lambs , God , and throw them to the wolves ?
The worst thing imaginable has happened .
It's even stranger when an angel is so angry .
I think I hear the drums far away .
It doesn't matter .
His neigh is like a monarch's command .
If I can find any animal in this wild forest , I'll either be food for it or bring it as food for you .
You're appealing to a son who hates you .
I will go straight to visit him .
I can't , ma'am .
Yes , she did tell us .
Please , somebody , get us out of here !
Who tricked you ?
I think a few members of the court should fetch the young prince from Wales and bring him to London to be crowned our king .
Then I hope night shadows your day , and death takes your life !
This is what it's all about , Please , I beg you , No , my lord , I'm comfortable like this , thank you .
The gates of mercy will be closed by then , and harsh and hard-hearted soldiers , who have tasted blood , will have free reign to commit whatever violence they want , mowing down your lovely young virgins and budding infants .
You get trickier and trickier .
What else could you possibly think of me ?
I'll give you a good reason to cringe , I promise you .
He will show me the part of heaven where the bachelors sit , and I'll have fun there forever .
Holy Father Lawrence instructed me to fall on my knees and beg your forgiveness .
From now on , take care of your messages yourself .
Do so .
Leap and dance for him .
We don't know .
That's a lame answer .
Probably because my cheeks ' roses needed rain , which I could easily give them with all the tears in my eyes .
Good-bye , good Queen .
This harms my reputation .
Error in the bill , sir , error in the bill !
Why , what do you imagine his name to be ?
Has homely old age taken the alluring beauty from my poor cheeks ?
Me too , I swear .
Well , all of these should be in the lantern , because they're all in the moon .
I'm a prince by birth , Miranda , maybe even a king now ; though I wish I weren't , and normally I wouldn't put up with carrying these logs any more than I'd let flies breed in my mouth .
Cheer up .
You , sir , where's my daughter ?
My husband lost his life to get the crown , and my sons ' fortunes have been tossed up and down , leaving me to rejoice over their victories and weep over their losses .
Signior Benedick !
Why , she's inside .
I can't see ahead of me .
Stop , even if only to kill me .
You're still here ?
It was the play in which you wooed the gentlewoman so successfully .
Go away !
You need not kneel to me .
Please let me know your plan , Bassanio .
How will that kill this marriage ?
I've sworn I'll never sleep with him or talk to him again .
Go , coward that you are .
You will also confess , I'm sure , that you love me .
He made my heart leap for you .
Master , master , I've been on the lookout so long , I'm ready to fall down dead , but I've got one , finally !
I have no choice .
Here's an empty seat , sir .
No more than twenty-five .
Oh , it's too bad !
Lorenzo will be happy with what we've done .
As a favor to Nope .
Is she dead ?
He has no friends except those who are too afraid to defy him .
If she won't tell Benedick , someone else should .
No , sir , she's human .
You scolded him in private ?
This calm submission is dishonorable and vile .
If I extinguish the candle , I can light it again if I regret it .
I'm strong-willed .
A man who achieves more in war than his captain does becomes his captain's rival .
To tell you that you'll see me at Philippi .
Come on , Iago .
Let's go to bed , knight .
Take it , brave York .
A spirit ?
So have a seat and talk to her .
The testament !
This one , and I will give her to you .
If grief doesn't kill me , I'll find a quicker way to kill myself , even though I think grief will do the job just as well .
Thanks for letting me go .
He ate at my house , but that doesn't make me nervous .
Very much so .
I can't tell you anything else .
Mighty duke , please allow me to say something .
He deserves a beautiful wife more than all the other men I've ever seen .
Here comes another Jew .
I'm happy to meet you , my lady and my wife .
Oh , the poor bird .
No , it's a story .
I would have been what I am even if the most virginal star in the heavens had twinkled at my conception .
Why do you say that ?
Though I expect she'll wear me out more quickly than I'll wear out what I'm wearing , which will be good for her and even better for me !
She was here just now .
Take off my armor .
Isn't that true ?
Please , corporal , stop !
And were you then happy to find shelter on a bed of hay along with swine and homeless bums ?
Pretty lady , I'm much ashamed of your shocking behavior .
I wish I could give you the little strength that I have .
Oh , my lady , I'm ashamed to admit it .
What , aren't you a Christian ?
It's my men who should call me "lord." I'm your man , your fellow .
Yes , you're right .
The interest rate will be , Well , Shylock ?
I hope poisonous swampy fog covers her face and ruins her complexion !
He was on his way here with your wife .
I won't sleep until I've delivered your letter , my lord .
Hail !
How are my old friends from this island doing ? , Honey , they'll love you here in Cyprus .
I remember wooing a pea plant in her name , and then taking two pea pods and begging her to wear them "for my sake." Those of us who are really in love will do the strangest things .
Anyway , what's up ?
Your true demonic features are distorting your body .
Yet you killed my children .
There is no world for me outside the walls of Verona , except purgatory , torture , and hell itself .
I'm glad to see you .
I wouldn't care about my spirits , if my legs weren't tired .
He didn't ask questions , but answered ours at length .
Oh , he's like a snake disguised as a flower .
But are you sure that Benedick loves Beatrice that much ?
I will , Caesar .
She trembled and shook because he stamped and swore and carried on as though the vicar were trying to put something over on him .
Most mighty Caesar , give me some reason , so I won't be laughed at when I tell them so .
I have no doubt that you love me .
You were one of his favorites .
Which ones are the malefactors ?
Yes , I guarantee he won't drown , even if this ship were as fragile as an eggshell and as leaky as a menstruating woman .
As a friend or an enemy ?
And you , sister ?
Everything you told me I already knew .
This clearing will be the stage , and this hawthorn bush will be our dressing room .
To Brutus's , to Cassius's , let's burn them all .
I'll go and coach them .
Did I do anything good to myself ?
The court awards it and the law authorizes it .
Yes , he'll weep stones , as he taught us to do .
Signior Benedick served well in the war , my lady .
My dear clever Ariel , listen carefully .
Come to my room later on .
Why shouldn't I be there in person ?
Yes , if I'm still alive , and you're still sane , and your dinner is worth eating .
The will , the will !
Kill !
Her bottom .
And now that I have the boy , I'll undo the spell that makes her vision so disgustingly wrong .
Just a man , like any other .
It's a good tragedy , very well done .
All of them ?
Gertrude , he says he's found out the reason for your son's insanity .
How clever of you .
Again !
Good-bye .
You won it .
Please , tell us .
He's speaking now , or perhaps he's whispering , "Where's my serpent of the Nile ? " For that's his pet name for me .
Help , Charmian , help , Iras , help !
I wear it with pride , for I am Welsh you know , good countryman .
I can tell you who time strolls for , who it trots for , who it gallops for , and who it stops cold for .
Her blood has stopped , and her joints are stiff .
I will harp on it till my heartstrings break .
Think like this all day , and you'll learn how to curse .
You have my consent .
If I were , I wouldn't need to ask you what happened .
I'm seizing your lands and all that you possess until your brother gives testimony that absolves you of any guilt .
Thanks , my dear lord .
You are completely wrong about this king .
Who is leading his men ?
My dagger , little nephew ?
I'm glad to see you .
But did you listen to all that poetry without even wondering about what your name is doing on all these trees ?
Then I'll change it to this : Father Time himself is bald , so for all time there will be bald men .
Oh Iago !
We can't be in two places at once , both here and there !
Oh , don't injure your cousin like that !
He's killed three people , and he's so furious right now that the only thing that will satisfy him is seeing you die .
But who is that ?
I will leave here for Verona tonight .
There you go .
Bring down that top sail !
This is the final discussion I will grant .
No , please , read it like a sane person .
The old priest at Saint Luke's Church is at your command at all hours .
Tell me , Othello .
My lord , the enemy has already passed the marsh .
So go and put your stamp on the girl .
Hello !
Antonio and Shylock , both of you come forward .
I will not live to hear the news from England .
Let's follow the old earl , and get that crazy Tom to take him wherever he wants to go .
Would I send a lie ?
There are enemies here .
I just meant that our hearts are joined , so we can almost think of them as one heart .
Did you hear that ?
Sit down , Clitus .
I'll walk around and force the commoners off the streets .
Lord , what fools these mortals are !
Life is a story told by an idiot , full of noise and emotional disturbance but devoid of meaning .
In that case , leave our cousin Katherine here with us .
Should we go see the sights in the town ?
I've written to my sister telling her everything he's said .
Why do you sound so odd ?
Don't believe in this .
What's that paper you were reading ?
Let me see .
I need proof !
What kind of life do you lead that your poor friends must beg for your company ?
This disease is beyond my medical skills .
Forget your epilogue .
Cheer up , Antonio !
Mine did too .
You'll make me angry .
Tell me , you unknown power , He can read your thoughts .
Where do you want me to go to respond to these charges ?
What a strange sight , a man who has put on all his fancy clothes but forgotten his brain at home !
After a brief time , as he is a strong , brave man ,
It's often the case that having something makes us spoiled , while not having it turns out to be advantageous .
See that it is done , and prepare a feast for the soldiers .
You sell fish .
Before I learn how to love , I'll learn how to follow orders .
People who want to start a big fire quickly start with little twigs .
Oh , I suffered along with all the men I watched suffer !
Go away and take your children .
My lady Olivia , your niece , disapproves of your late-night partying .
Nothing ?
He said that the people weren't used to being spoken to except by the What blocks of wood !
Things are what they are .
I know you can do better than that , but it'll do for now .
I've done no more to Caesar than you will do to me .
Well , so-so .
Listen to my little story , and when it's done , oh , my heart will break !
Do you remember her face ?
He wants the child for himself , to accompany him on his wanderings through the wild forests .
Hurry up and get to your horse .
If not , he's got truth on his side !
Beautifully , sir , beautifully !
If your vengeful heart can't forgive me , here , take my sword and bury it in my heart so that my soul , which adores you , can be free .
The king of Naples , my arch-enemy , listens to my brother's request , which was that the king , in exchange for the respect and money paid to him , would get rid of me and make my brother Duke of Milan instead .
She was previously Caius Marcellus' wife .
This will make them both so afraid that they'll kill each other just by looking at each other .
Go hang yourselves , all of you !
It sang about my crimes .
Passionately" ?
What about you ?
My lord , the queen wants to speak with you right away .
You're a villain !
But by the grace of God , she's mine .
Where's your father ?
The nobles of Cyprus whom you invited to dinner are waiting for you .
Right now I'm away from home and I can't provide you with proper care .
Until then , my noble friend , think about this : I'd rather be a poor villager than call myself a citizen of Rome under the hard conditions that this time is likely to put us through .
I've got the whole barrel , man .
How unlucky am I , having to apologize for doing the right thing !
How did you two get separated ?
There's magic in its fabric .
But don't be afraid to take the crown that belongs to you .
Please , leave me alone .
She has a low-pitched voice .
When I said that , I was angry too .
Give me the daggers .
The citizens are around , and Tybalt is dead .
Has it come to this ?
I wish you all the best .
The Queen is here , my lord .
What should I do that I'm not doing ?
What is there left to do ?
Pluck off colorful butterfly wings , and use them to fan moonbeams away from his eyes as he sleeps .
I think all tendencies to jealousy were burned out of him by the sun of his native land .
The king and queen are coming down with everyone else .
This is a pitiful sight !
Ariel , you've done your work exactly as I ordered .
Your son is crazy .
Ha , ha , heard in Genoa .
Oh , father , I'm taking care of your business .
I'll steal away to England , and I'll steal some more when I get there .
Are you talking about Caesar ?
He'll make your palace tremble for this insult , even if it were the mightiest in all of Europe .
If I could shoot lightning bolts from my eyes , I can tell you who'd be on the ground .
We'll meet at the giant oak tree in the duke's forest .
Such an expression of despair would only prove that I was guilty .
Whisper to her that Ursula and I are walking in the orchard and that we're talking all about her .
Your highness , I want nothing more than what you've already offered .
Yes , I should know , but it disturbs me .
My lord , what's wrong with you ?
Where is your army , then , to beat him back ?
I love you so much that I'll send your soul to heaven very soon , if heaven will accept anything from me , that is .
What we have to worry about is a full-scale invasion from Scotland , always an unreliable neighbor .
Good friends , I thank you all for coming to see me wed this patient , sweet , virtuous wife .
That was when I was young and inexperienced and didn't know what passion was .
Who is this fool who wants all the fuss of marriage ?
In short , when I told him how firmly opposed I was to his hideous plan , he pulled out his sword and lunged at my defenseless body , cutting my arm .
We'll have the wedding at the church tomorrow .
He hasn't done anything to harm you yet .
Performing is activity , and he is always doing that .
Have you heard about anything unusual happening in the city ?
But I know you'd never force me to tell you things I don't want to , so I should be polite and tell you what I can .
I can't make myself a man by wishing I were , so as a woman I'll die , from grieving .
Why did you do that ?
He's as brave as a fox .
She's talking .
Well , sir , because silver has a sweet sound .
I'm no less noble than you are , Edmund .
It's now late at night , and actions must accommodate bodily needs , which we'll satisfy with only a short rest .
Cassio doesn't know you .
We are men , my lord .
No , calm down .
All this conversing has turned men into tongues , and fancy ones , at that .
My lord , what are you talking about ?
The "passionate" duke ?
Well , because I saw your niece Olivia treat the count's messenger better than she's ever treated me .
If we lose this battle , this is the last time we'll speak to each other .
They were poisoned , then .
Caliban , who now serves me .
If you were as young as I am , if you were in love with Juliet , if you had just married her an hour ago , if then you murdered Tybalt , if you were lovesick like me , and if you were banished , then you might talk about it .
You have a noble wife who is much more beautiful than any other woman in this declining age .
I see you're all eaten up with emotion .
Now get out of here !
The poison is as sweet as balm , as soft as air , as gentle , Oh , Antony ! , No , I'll take you too .
Those island-bred skeletons , terrified for their bones , are an offensive sight on the morning field .
Please just listen .
Yes , even if I die an hour later .
Oh , what a sinful thought !
We have to take the king's side .
The king has just honored me , and I have earned the good opinion of all sorts of people .
I wish I were as big and strong as you .
We are all made of dreams , and our life stretches from sleep before birth to sleep after death .
Yes , we get the idea .
What's up , my man ?
Let's go !
That's exactly what they said .
Hello , Cassio !
Get yourself to a convent , at once .
He's awfully proud , but his pride suits him .
Please , don't take it badly , but I can not and will not give in to you .
Oh , let me kiss his hand !
Indeed , the French can bet twenty French crowns to one that they'll beat us , they have such an army .
I sent for you about a sad occasion .
What do you want , fellow ?
Madam , hurry as fast as you can get out of my court .
For God's sake , send somebody else .
Hey !
The boy was going to support me in my old age !
Advancement to some scaffold , to lose their heads .
Everyone except the sailors dove into the sea , leaving behind the ship that I had set on fire .
He's an unremarkable man , fit only to be sent on errands .
I don't know , madam .
This guy will tell us everything .
Don't you have any sense at all ?
I wouldn't stay here tonight for the entire town .
Alright , here's the vial .
The day , my friends , and everything await me .
He says your daughter's not feeling well , my lord .
I can help you find a wife who's rich , young , beautiful , and reared in a manner fit for a gentlewoman .
But Count Claudio can stay , for what I'm about to say concerns him .
The table of contents says it's in the first chapter of his heart .
For himself to ruin , " he says .
Let's be angry only long enough to do the deed , and then let's act like we're disgusted by what we had to do .
You have to wait for the appropriate time to let loose .
Well , it's not for me to say .
It doesn't matter if it's in tune so long as it's loud enough .
You have offered me the lands of Sicily and Sardinia .
I think I hear Antony call me .
Or at least I can describe the rumors .
Should we sing a round to wake up the night owl ?
You're perfect , without a rival in the world , made up of the best qualities of every creature .
I mean when I wore it at your daughter's wedding .
You can't party your way into dukedoms there .
When we love our job we get up early and go to it joyfully .
My spells are working well , my spirits are obeying me , and everything is right on schedule .
Tell me , who had him arrested ?
Find a time to speak with Don Pedro and Claudio alone .
No , I didn't say that .
Really ?
Turn around , you dog from hell , turn around !
In its tail .
Does Leonato have a son , my lord ?
What are you saying ?
He did , my lord .
Yes , ma'am .
I have news , old news such as you never heard before !
Age won't wither her , and her charms are so varied that she never grows boring .
I've had to acknowledge that he's my son so many times that now I can do it without embarrassment .
Look up moonshine , look up moonshine !
Are you thinking of buying her ?
The word is too good to represent her wickedness .
But since the gibe glanced off me , ten to one it hit you both straight on .
My heart feels like it's full of poisonous snakes !
She blushes at the slightest thing .
The king has strictly forbidden it .
My name is Proculeius .
I don't think it would be wise to let Mark Antony , whom Caesar is so fond of , outlive Caesar .
To be honest , I don't know why I'm so sad .
It's sad , but Iago knows she had sex with Cassio a thousand times .
What crimes have you committed to be sent here to this prison ?
You can do what you want , but he's an experienced and honorable soldier .
Murder !
Now I want her more than ever .
Is it possible to be wise , bewildered , calm , furious , loyal , and neutral all at once ?
Welcome , my lord .
My memory is hazy , more like a dream than a recollection .
All my pretty little children ?
She speaks daggers , and every word stabs .
You're wrong , sir , I do care about something .
If you love Rosalind as much as you say you do , you will marry her when your brother marries Aliena .
Are they all ready ?
We came here to fight against you .
Fool , speak well of yourself .
Where will the old duke live ?
My beautiful warrior !
I'm sorry , Malvolio , but this isn't my writing , though I admit it looks like mine .
Good .
I'd never heard such raucous music , such pleasant thunder .
Let's go .
Just cry out , "Ah me ! " Just say "love" and "dove." Say just one lovely word to my good friend
Can't help it ?
Goodbye , then .
I swear , I think my wife's faithful , and I think she's not .
You disgust me , you little bug !
He said "Goodbye , madam , " and nothing else .
The news I have to tell your majesty is that Buckingham's army has dispersed from sudden floods and heavy rainfall .
No , no more than is reasonable .
My enemies help me understand myself better , which is an advantage , and my friends help me lie about myself , which is a disadvantage .
He is as full of courage as of kindness , princely in both .
Both , both , my girl .
Now go find the forest ranger .
It's all still yours .
Yes , the leader of the team ; the one that gets you if you can't pay a debt ; the one who assumes people are always going to bed and says to them , "Have arrest." Well , sir , stop your joking there .
Look , if you really love the beautiful Hero , enjoy it .
If we let crimes like this happen , slaves and heathens will be our rulers .
There are women like that out there , no question .
Please give in , sweet Hermia. , And Lysander , stop acting like she's yours .
He loves them both .
Me too , lieutenant .
I'll tear it up when it's paid .
I've fought my way through obstacles twenty times more terrifying than you with this weapon .
Will you be having dinner with her tonight ?
When we meet on Judgment Day , that look of yours will send me from heaven to hell , where devils will grab me .
There are tears for his love , joy for his fortune , honor for his bravery , and death for his ambition .
They only feel the shadow of joy .
That Don John had given him a thousand pieces of gold for wrongfully accusing the Lady Hero .
I'll never see it .
I'm a gentleman .
They say Gloucester's bastard son is .
And as for what I promised to you , I'm as good as my word .
His drugs work quickly .
No , my lord .
If you can love a man of this temperament , Kate , whose face a sunburn wouldn't make any worse and who never looks in the mirror to admire himself , let your eye improve me .
Madam ?
It's dark , like my shoe .
He exposed Edgar's murderous plot , and was wounded , as you see there , when trying to apprehend him .
His mistake was hardly worth punishing him for in the first place , though in wartime it is sometimes necessary to make examples out of even the best soldiers .
There is nothing on Earth that is so evil that it does not provide the earth with some special quality .
Why ?
Now all the young men of England are inspired and have stored their party clothes in the closet .
What about it ?
You may do whatever you want in the world .
Did he treat you well when you saw him ?
What do you say , Signior Gremio ?
Now I'll offend you whether I give it to you or not .
So will I .
What's the matter with you , madam ?
Oh , will you leave me alone in the dark ?
But Antonio's certainly ruined .
He's done wrong , and his master the king will punish him for it .
I want to head out tonight .
I see him revive himself to praise my noble act .
Yes , we will .
I carry no hatred , holy man , because my request will benefit my enemy .
I've noticed it myself .
Although many people said she looked like me , she was considered beautiful .
Listen to me , good brother .
Have I hugged you yet ?
Everyone says you can't make up your mind .
The two of them were separated during the storm .
I'm sorry to find you like this .
Have you seen him today ?
Good night , lieutenant .
I beg you , turn away and cry for her .
It's a deal .
Even if I had sworn never to marry , I wouldn't trust myself to keep that promise if Hero would marry me .
Please , my friend , give me all the news , both good and bad , at the same time .
The man in the moon !
It's amazing , if I may say so , that she let herself be tamed .
Damn that dirty black coalminer of a devil !
Yes .
You said she slept with Cassio .
But I made an oath , an oath , an oath in heaven .
He rode that prologue like a wild horse .
Right now ; as fast as she can say the vows .
In exchange , give up your claim to love Helena , since I love her and will love her until I die .
Oh , my bad luck has forced honest men to become traitors .
I want to do a little good despite my evil nature .
Yes , what about it ?
Please , do me this one favor : find out what I've done to offend this knight .
Why , so did you .
Goodbye .
Where does he sleep ?
That makes me love you even more .
Well , it seems to me that she is too short to be praised highly , too dark to be praised fairly , and too small to be praised greatly .
You're a poor man if you're this impatient !
I hope I see him and hear him again soon .
What a horrible day !
The tunnels !
Now that's patience !
What country is this , friends ?
After you harvest , you have to sheaf and bind So throw ripe Rosalind on the harvest cart .
I don't want to be cured , boy .
I'll go put my armor on .
Yes , madam , twenty different messengers .
The chicken is burning , the pig is overcooked , the clock has already struck twelve , and my mistress has clocked me one on the cheek .
Take this .
Our advance will so dazzle the enemy that England will cower in fear and surrender .
It would be better if they were all on his father's side , or that there were none at all on his father's side .
Is the news good or bad ?
Try being sick , great greatness , and see if ceremony can cure you !
We will .
Come here , Sir Seacole .
He says I won't get into heaven because I'm a Jew's daughter , and he says you're irresponsible because by converting Jews to Christianity you're raising the price of pork .
Is that a tradition ?
I'll die You're of royal blood , and we obey you .
Doesn't everyone want a wife like that ?
The priest is already there .
Come on , let me wipe your face .
Son , I'll stake you half that Bianca comes .
But she's got to die , or she'll cheat on other men .
Mercy , mercy !
If not , come when you have the courage .
I can't help remembering the things that were most precious to me .
He won't see my face ever again .
It sure is .
I'll fall at his feet and lie there until my pleading and crying convinces the duke to come here and force my husband to leave this abbey .
No metal , not even the executioner's axe , could ever be half as sharp as your hatred .
Those tears will bring blessings to you .
And that's true , he Then I pleaded for you .
The Moor's killed my mistress !
Pretend to be very concerned about both the Prince , who has compromised his honor by making the match , and Claudio , whose reputation will be ruined by this woman who's pretending to be a virgin .
Without doubt I've heard that .
As my child , I order you to do so .
I think it's too rough , too rude , too rowdy , and it pricks like a thorn .
He is a subject for a king to contemplate , and for a king's king to ride on , and for the world at large , both friend and stranger , to stop whatever they are doing and marvel at .
We did , my lord , weeping and carrying on about the sobbing deer .
Keep him away from me !
No , absolutely not .
Yes , indeed , and all the King's men , the Duke of Milan and his fine son too .
Here's someone coming in his pajamas , with a candle and weapons .
You all saw that on the Lupercal feast day I offered him a king's crown three times , and he refused it three times .
Now die , die , die , die , die .
He writes brave poems , speaks brave words , makes brave promises , and then breaks them just as bravely .
What else ?
These men all have one intention , and it's directed against Caesar .
Prepare yourselves , generals .
My lord loves you .
The sun itself has never seen anyone as beautiful since the world began .
Take a trumpet , herald .
I am Benedick .
You must be over there .
But how ?
Why , man ?
Are you trying to wash him out of his grave with tears ?
That he had sex with you .
This man is probably like that .
You scoundrel !
What do you say , your Highness , about my just request ?
Take that , and that .
Everything's OK .
Yes , very much like a whale .
I'm tired of this moon .
Live in the moment .
The nobleman's are as huge as the underfed villager's .
Apparently so. , Cover their faces .
He's just as terrified of Sir Andrew .
Yes , my lord .
Death has sucked the honey from your breath , but it has not yet ruined your beauty .
I love you all the more for not liking it .
But enough about that .
The battle on the sea is almost lost .
Even my tears burn me like molten lead .
And when he strikes back at you , he'll hit you as sure as you're standing there .
His soul is as dull as night and dark as the underworld .
Don't get wound up , my good man .
He constantly offends me .
Get out , insolent eunuch !
Well , other men have bad luck too .
I have half a mind to hit you before you speak again .
Get out of that position , because I can disarm you with my magic wand and make your sword drop .
Be patient with him , Brutus .
Oh , lieutenant !
Yes , alright , go , I say , and bring him here .
My brother is imprisoned because of you , I am disgraced , and the nobility are held in contempt while those who two days ago weren't worth a dime have suddenly been promoted .
Where would Othello go ? , Oh , look at you !
You may , sir .
And just for today , Oh , Lord , just today don't think of the crime my father committed in seizing the crown !
Can any horse retrace his footsteps with the same energy he had when he walked them the first time ?
Make us your agents of revenge , so we can praise you when we're victorious !
Be tough , " says the devil , "and run ! " But then my conscience , hanging around my heart , says very wisely to me , "My good friend Launcelot , you're a good boy , the son of an honest man , " really , that should be the son of an honest woman , since my father cheated on my mother .
And then his clerk , who went to a lot of trouble with the writing , begged for mine .
Goneril , you aren't worth the dust the wind blows in your face .
Yes , and you dared Caesar to fight the battle at Pharsalia , where he fought against Pompey .
Here comes my man , the man I'm looking for .
Write down that Prince John is a villain .
I met my father in the woods yesterday and had a long conversation with him .
I was told that you were violent , proud , and sullen .
But my heart is still throbbing to know one thing .
If you're being fair , you'll have to describe me as someone who loved too much , but who wasn't wise about it .
Let's speak to him .
Oh , I see , you will only part with lightweight presents .
It doesn't need to be witty as long as it's eloquent and imaginative .
So give me my nightgown , Emilia , and I'll say goodnight .
Whatever has already been done can't be undone now .
You take my life when you take away my means of making a living .
When was there ever an age , since the beginning of time , that didn't feature more than one famous man ?
Why , sir , he's not coming .
Look !
Where's that snake ?
Many times , madam .
No , not for all the world .
Yes .
And what would you give me for the handkerchief ?
Why , a bad action is just a wrong in this world , but when you've won the whole world , it's a wrong in your own world , so you can make it right then .
I'll talk with this good man .
Isn't that your habit ?
Please have a seat .
If not , then I'm a liar .
It won't last .
Be angry whenever you like , it's all right with me .
He was perfect in everything .
What do you mean by that , Malvolio ?
So then the Poles won't be willing to defend it .
Lead those away who will follow you , and we'll explain publicly the reasons for Caesar's death .
He talks nothing but nonsense .
If the Jew cuts deep enough , I'll pay it instantly with all my heart .
I'm ready to suffer peacefully whatever he does to me in his cruelty and anger .
Say the last word I spoke was "Antony , " and please word it pathetically .
Be brave like the lion and proud .
We respected the beat of the song , sir .
Do you know me ?
It is , my lord .
There I'll see only myself .
But I've often heard him argue that when sons are at their prime and their fathers are declining , the sons should be their fathers ' guardians and manage their fathers ' money .
She's an excellent , sweet woman , and there's no doubt that she is virtuous .
A piece of ice .
Go find him .
And before I make her normal again , I can cure her by treating her with another plant , I'll make her give me that little boy as my page .
Why , what's the danger ?
Mine too. , Are you listening , monster ?
The gods protect him from so great a shame !
They come from the four corners of the earth to kiss this shrine and see this living , breathing saint .
Goneril with a white beard ?
Uncle , I'm coming out !
Happy that we're not too happy , lucky in being not too lucky .
My happiness and yours lie in her .
Or was it a blessing that we came here ?
Come , Romeo .
This guy's wise enough to play the fool , and only clever people can do that .
Until that happens , let me be who I am and don't try to change me .
Good morning , cousin .
I wish they had stayed !
If you're someone who gets into fights , I'll fight with you .
Oh , but there's one more thing to tell you .
Your fall has left a blot that opens even the best and brightest to suspicion .
You dog , you peasant !
I would have thrown away all other considerations and made her my wife .
Please , give me that goblet , if you love me .
You have broken my heart .
My children would have enjoyed a better death if God had blessed you with a purer life .
I can be discreet in honorable matters , ride a horse , run , tell a good story badly , and deliver a plain message bluntly .
I accept your devotion with my deepest love .
Die where you have lived , in my arms .
You're a bitter fool .
What , you're leaving it with Lysander ?
Caesar and Lepidus are organizing their military operation .
Soldiers , watch carefully .
Sir Toby , madam , your relative .
And what about him , Tranio ?
I'll go back inside and ask the lady for some kind of escort .
Find out where the Jew's house is .
Anyone who says that is a lying piece of garbage .
Husband , I'll eat with you in private today and hear your confession about all the pranks you've pulled .
Let's get dressed quickly and then meet in the hall .
I should have known it .
How is my noble lord ?
What's that , you runt ?
There were many even more memorable feasts .
I'll tell you : it's because of a law as plain as Father Time's bald head .
No , because my manly heart is grieving .
He speaks well .
But it's dangerous to make him try to make sense of the time he lost .
Run and proclaim it in the streets .
Her sighs and tears are like great winds and floods .
Look , I have a weapon , the best sword a soldier could have .
Please tell me what you're thinking , even your worst suspicions .
Be patient , I'm telling you .
Old Montague is here , and he's waving his sword around just to make me mad .
What's she doing now ?
What's going on here , you secret , evil , midnight hags ?
Please lie down and rest a while , my lord .
But please tell me more .
I did , and now I've got it !
Go and wiggle your ears !
Everything will be all right .
No , madam .
Yes , as much as you look like yourself .
Put a candle in my study , Lucius .
Yes sir , I'm fairly witty .
I sent the king's son off by himself to a faraway nook on the island , where he's sitting now sighing , with his arms crossed like this .
Who do you want to work for ?
What's that noise ?
Gone , sir .
Quiet , everyone !
This box is too threatening .
Let's go find him and cheer him up .
I never talked with her in my life .
Oh , my heart , my heart is rising into my throat !
Good night , everyone .
I drew my sword to part them .
What's this man's reputation like here in the city ?
What if this mixture doesn't work at all ?
May Egypt drown in the Nile and all good creatures turn into poisonous snakes .
How can that be ?
Yes , let's do that .
If you can't , and would prefer to leave , she's very willing to say goodbye to you .
A sailor's wife had chestnuts in her lap and munched away at them .
This is to feel the news , not hear it .
But did I fall or not ?
They're all ready to eat dinner .
How did you like the young German , the duke of Saxony's nephew ?
Though we have lost a generous king , we are about to enjoy the benefits of a new king .
People say he's generous , well educated , and brave , and he's very attractive .
Are you my son ?
That would make anyone cry enough to water his garden with his tears .
These times of pain are bad times for romance .
Get down on your knees and thank heaven for sending you such a good man .
Ambassadors of Harry , king of England , request a hearing with your Majesty .
Let me go .
I won't miss any chance to send my love to you .
Let go of me .
You're in your own kingdom , sir .
Don Pedro is here .
But Benedick was once an enemy of love as well , and now he's become a real man .
Along the way , I'll find an opportunity to separate him from the queen's proud relatives , as step one in the plan we've discussed .
Who are these men ?
I wish I could sleep too , it would stop me from thinking .
No , madam .
I'm your evil spirit , Brutus .
Your name is Lucentio , you say .
I'll tell you everything exactly as it happened .
My food , my fortune , my sweetest hope , my heaven on earth , and my entrance to heaven .
I had planned to celebrate it quietly , but since my lord is once more himself , I will be Cleopatra again .
Cassio can have my job .
It wouldn't let my soul find its way to air but smothered it inside my gasping body .
I told you not to hang around my house .
My old bones are tired .
As for this ghost we just saw , he's a real one , I can tell you that much .
Cleopatra summoned him .
Well she was , good Curtis , before this frost .
You'll find us both at Crosby Place .
Their unfortunate deaths put an end to their parents ' feud .
Watch me : stroke your chins and swear by your beards that I am a knave .
Now , your gown ?
Give a quick example .
I'll say goodbye once more .
Please , if you can do it without taking advantage of the young man , buy the cottage , pasture , and flock for us , and we'll pay you for it .
Yes , we are .
But now we don't have to !
We have to be married properly .
Tell him not to send any more messengers , unless you feel like coming back to tell me how he took the bad news .
My thanes and kinsmen , I name you all earls , the first earls that Scotland has ever had .
You know from my clothing who I am .
What if I'd said I saw him do something to hurt you ?
He's had a ship wrecked coming from Tripolis .
The thane of Cawdor has lost what the noble Macbeth has won .
A What's going on ?
Thank you .
Their illness confounds the most advanced techniques of modern medicine , but when he touches them , they heal immediately because of the power granted to him by heaven .
God knows I loved my niece , and now she's dead , slandered to death by cowards who would just as likely fight a real man as I would grab a poisonous snake by the tongue .
What , am I being denied death , as well ?
So it's nearly the time when the ghost likes to appear .
That's some nap .
What have you heard from her ?
So if four negatives make two affirmatives , I'm worse off because of my friends and better off because of my foes .
Look who's here !
You have so much natural talent , but like someone who hoards money , you use none of your talent for the right purpose , not your body , not your love , not your mind .
Rest easy in the meantime .
Why , Fool ?
Gentlemen , I don't know what you intend to do , who else you intend to kill , who else you consider corrupt .
A messenger from Lord Stanley .
So take your last breath .
Here comes a messenger .
Good Volumnius , you know that we went to school together .
Wait !
Katherina , you may stay .
The beautiful Helen of Troy had a thousand suitors .
I admire your efforts , and all of you will share the rewards .
Are you beautiful ?
The more you beat me , the more I'll love you .
So stop hoping and wondering what I mean .
So with no money , but a little more wisdom , I'm going back to Venice .
Just now we put him in the abbey over here , and now he's over there .
Humble as I am , I represent Antony .
Here , my lord .
I will .
Come , come with me , and we'll do the job quickly .
But there's more work to be done .
You represented yourself as just a common man .
Duke of Burgundy , if you want peace , the lack of which creates these misfortunes you describe , you must purchase it buy agreeing across-the-board to all our very just demands .
Something about Hamlet .
The container of that great soul is now cold .
You can't get any more money out of me right now .
I don't think you've got much of a reason to love me .
Where's Seleucus ?
Yes , your Highness .
Very clever !
I wish you could face your bad news like a man !
I didn't have the heart to say no to him .
Good heavens , man , give them more than that !
Has any man seen him at the barber's ?
You can't trust them .
Your last guess is right .
The silk came from sacred silkworms , and it was dyed with fluid made from embalmed virgins ' hearts .
If she and I are happy , what's it to you ?
I think I see my cousin Tybalt's ghost .
Let's go for it .
Who wouldn't get sad thinking about things like that ?
She's the daughter of this famous Duke of Milan I heard so much about but never saw before .
Is it on record that he built it , or is it just word of mouth ?
Let them marry your children !
I want you to live , since to me , death is happiness .
Was there ever such an evil book with such a beautiful cover ?
Did you hear her speak ?
There is scorn and disdain in her eyes , and those sparkling eyes despise everything they look upon .
If I weren't a merciful man , I'd forget about your missing brother and punish you in his place .
My name is Pistol .
Yes , leave that labor to great Hercules , it's worse than the previous twelve put together .
Cambio .
Yes , but he'd deny it all .
You're like the poor cat in the old story .
Can we go ?
Plain and simple loyalty doesn't make anyone act phony .
You will not blame us in your funeral speech , but will say all the good you want to about Caesar and that you do it by our permission .
If you want to come have dinner with me , you can .
I beg you , listen well .
Keep this libertine occupied with endless debauchery .
But how is it possible that you still remember this , through all the darkness of the past ?
Know the glove !
You wanted to be king of the island , sir ?
But I won't let myself fall for him any more than your permission allows .
From what , in God's name ?
Then my love is humble .
Oh , it is my love .
Lend me your handkerchief .
Give him a noose to hang himself .
What , are you sleepy ?
What do you call this ?
So calm down .
I couldn't stay behind after you left .
Oh , finish what I've begun .
Wait , let me hire him too. , Here's my fool's cap , a token of my gratitude .
Are you her husband , boy ?
What's more , people at the
Lord , Lord , when she was a little baby , Oh , there is one nobleman in the city , a guy named Paris , who would be happy to claim her as his own .
As for his thoughts , I wish he'd think about nothing at all rather than think about me all the time .
What satisfaction could you possibly have tonight ?
It's Brabantio .
He looks like he just recently stopped breastfeeding .
Beatrice , I swear , I'm going .
Don't let him leave out the color of her hair .
Do you acknowledge the contract ?
Or come back to life again and challenge me to a duel in some deserted place .
Short but still tedious ?
Surrender , dog !
It's impossible .
Are you on duty again tonight ?
I do hate
Look , here comes a walking fire .
Thieves !
After you , sir .
Oh , goodbye !
Ungodly and monstrous !
Go ahead .
Words before fighting .
The king is insane .
Go play with yourself .
He'd begged me to steal it many times .
He should swear by his two-faced self , and that's an oath I'll believe !
Yes , good idea ; that's the
I'm sorry about your daughter's death , but I swear our accusations were true , and backed up with proof .
No , you're just reminding me of something I've also noticed .
Nothing , good sir , except to help Sir Cobweb scratch my head .
I remember kissing her washing stick and the cow's udders that her pretty , chapped hands had milked .
By God , I order you to speak .
Sir , I think I saw him last night .
Once again , what's the news ?
But he told me to get lost and threatened to hit me , kick me , even kill me .
So don't think that I'm drunk .
Not me .
If I live to see you get married someday , all my wishes will come true .
My lord , that dirty clown whom you laughed at so often is also missing .
And my heart too .
Oh , forgive all my sins !
Take your seat .
It was not Caesar's bravery that conquered Antony but Antony's that has triumphed over himself .
Hound or spaniel , bitch or dog , Whether your tail is short or curly , Tom will make you cry and wail .
Here comes the owner of one piece .
Your wife , sir , your wife .
Do whatever you want , and I'll say your insults are just a bad mood .
Is it a beggar ?
Madam , oh , good Empress !
It turns kings into gods and men of lower rank into kings .
And , being men , the contents of Caesar's will would enrage you .
Nothing that interests me , my good lord .
You are my guests .
Nobody's that bad .
Listen , my lords , We're in a bit of a hurry , Leonato .
I'll tell you truly what I think about the king in my heart .
What you're doing is the way to make her scorn you continually .
Good luck .
Iago has kept his word .
Choose your revenge .
I'm the ghost of your father , doomed for a certain period of time to walk the earth at night , while during the day I'm trapped in the fires of purgatory until I've done penance for my past sins .
We're bound to each other in every possible way , except we need you to marry us .
Reading their mail isn't as bad .
Will you let me ?
Trinculo , if you interrupt him any more , I swear I'll knock some teeth out of your head .
Look , my cousin is whispering to Claudio that she loves him .
The clock has chimed midnight .
What endeavor , Popillius ?
Now I realize your brother tried to kill your father not just because your brother is an evil man , but because your father deserved it by being wicked himself .
It's bad news when a country is ruled by a child .
That's the one , sir .
Welcome , destruction , blood , and massacre !
Come , come , we're worrying about the worst-case scenario .
Probably because my cousin the villain would have killed my husband .
Tsk , you're wrong .
Always give him his way .
If the English had any sense , they would run away .
Very humid , I can't tell you how humid it is .
I didn't see him .
All right , then .
Therefore , in case he does , we must hold him back .
I'm leaving now .
I think one of them is nearby and can't get away .
Here is the cap your Worship ordered .
I've outshot you , and not for the first time .
Did you say Cassio ?
She and Susan , God rest her and all Christian souls , were born on the same day .
Early in the morning we'll both rush to Belmont .
Sir Walter Herbert , a renowned soldier ; Sir Gilbert Talbot ; Sir William Stanley ; Oxford ; the highly feared Pembroke ; Sir James Blunt ; Rice ap Thomas , with a valiant crew ; and many other famous and powerful noblemen .
That big ship over there looks no bigger
We'll maintain that she died the instant she was accused , and everyone who hears this will grieve for her , pity her , and excuse her actions .
That's too bad , because I spent a long time memorizing it , and it's poetic .
No , in its tongue .
You have weapons ?
Shall we go watch this wrestling , cousin ?
Welcome , gentlemen .
Give me that pickax and the crowbar .
Is my ink and paper ready ?
If your Majesties recall it , the Welsh fought very valiantly in a garden where there were leeks growing , wearing leeks in their Monmouth caps which , your Majesty knows , is to this day a badge of honorable military service .
Let's assume that she has a reason , which you don't know yet : have faith that she'll eventually explain why she shut the doors on you today .
My husband is often like this , and he has been since he was a child .
Now that's done , I'm going to walk on the fortification walls .
So go on , tell me the news .
Who are the actors ?
But I'm wishing for something I already have .
And so , on the wings of imagination and at the speed of thought , our scene flies swiftly on .
What brings him here ?
Nearest his heart." , Those are the very words .
I'm waiting here for the general , and I don't want him to see me with a woman .
You'd better understand that I won't wait till I'm chained up in your master's court , and I won't let myself be scolded even once by dull Octavia .
I wish I had a fault like that !
I'll speak as sharp as a dagger to her , but I won't use one on her .
Is his ship sturdy ?
When I ran into this holy man , those men you mentioned did come to mind , in fact .
Don't you know me still ?
No matter .
As for him , I never think about him .
I ask too much of you , but you're always willing .
I'll come see you right away .
Thisbe ?
Christ , it's a disaster .
Then if we lose this battle , you'll be willing to be led in chains through the streets of Rome ?
You are a rude , ragged nurse and an old , sullen playmate for such tender princes .
The men there won't give a penny to a lame beggar , but they'll pay ten cents to look at a freak show exhibit .
I'm a nobleman , and I know what I'm doing in assigning this job to you .
There isn't a single protrusion in the castle walls where these birds haven't built their hanging nests to sleep and breed .
I was never disloyal , and I never will be .
If I cut my finger , I'll use you as a bandage to stop the bleeding. , And your name , sir ?
I beg you to tell me your name so I can use it in my prayers .
Oh , it sounded like a sweet breeze blowing gently over a bank of violets , taking their scent with it .
It's like this : as long as a person tells me the truth , even though it means my death , I will listen as though he praised me .
Cheer up as much as you can .
You hear the charges .
I swear I never hated you or your father !
Prove you are worthy of your birth , which I do not doubt for a moment .
That's right .
But I don't think it'll hurt him to tell the truth .
Thank you , sir .
Oh , that most wicked fiend !
Phoebe wrote it .
Goodbye .
Tomorrow , sir , I'm fighting for my reputation , and any man who gets away without a broken bone or two is an exceptional wrestler indeed .
Lorenzo , that's for sure , and I'm also sure you're my love , who else do I love so much ?
It's meant in good will .
What did he do when you saw him ?
Now , most noble Brutus , the gods are friendly with us today so that we , who want peace , can live on to old age !
Don't try to find out more .
I swear , it must be thirty years .
Yes , I swear .
What could you possibly ask of me that I wouldn't give you , as long as it didn't damage my honor and self-respect ?
Curse you !
Where's Antonio , then ?
What time tomorrow should I send a messenger to you ?
Oh , what a sad sight !
Your Grace can do whatever he wants .
As clearly as I see you , my lord .
Let me have your attention for a moment .
And yet I would have made her happy had our luck not been so bad .
You couldn't see him , but I could .
Now , by St. George , my knighthood , and my crown , The first you profaned , the second you dishonored , and the third you stole .
And I came with him .
If I said something , she'd mock me so mercilessly that I'd probably disintegrate into air .
If that's true , I think the same thing about you .
Give me my fan , Peter .
No , don't hit him , lieutenant !
You aren't wood , you aren't stones , you're men .
But you don't have any of the symptoms my uncle told me about .
Why so pale , my friend ?
I've seen her do it .
No , not a sad song .
If only you had a clearer memory of who you are !
My soul is full of sorrow .
Shake off your sleepiness .
Shut up , fool .
Welcome , welcome to all of you .
Damn it !
Into my grave .
lain .
So you'll go to hell ?
What did you do that for ?
I'm a carpenter , sir .
Oh , the glory of war has faded .
Be on guard duty tonight .
How are you doing ?
Go tell the priests to perform a sacrifice immediately , and bring me their interpretation of the results .
It never occurred to me to imagine there was anything more to know .
He is what he is .
Unpunished !
Why are you so pale ?
Good monster !
No , what provoked you was your own bloody mind , which never thinks about anything but butchering .
No , I am a Welshman .
How are you , madam ?
Her once-trimmed hedges , like prisoners with wild , untended hair , put forth unruly twigs .
There was a time when you'd freely tell me that words were never music to your ear unless I said them , that objects never pleased your eye unless I showed them to you , that touches never pleased your hands unless they were my touches , and that food never tasted sweet to you unless I had prepared it .
I'm ready to hear you .
So that she may live , I'll say I cheated on Edward and that she is not really his child .
They will , Nerissa , but we'll be disguised as men .
Please , let me go .
My God , who knows ?
How tall is she ?
I wish your Highness knew my true feelings in this matter : I have never in my life loved my brother .
Were you born here ?
I will , in other words , kill you in three hundred and fifty ways .
That's why it's better for wise men to trumpet their own virtues , like I do .
Is this a dagger I see in front of me , with its handle pointing toward my hand ?
He has one ship bound for Tripoli , another heading for the Indies .
Whatever seems best to you .
Was it a man ?
Alright , I will .
And look , here's Publius , come to fetch me .
What will you give us ?
Come on , envelope , open up for me .
He's somewhere between boy and man .
Listening to their frightened voices , I couldn't reply "Amen" when they said "God bless us ! " Don't think about it so much .
Your wit is so forceful , it frightens the very meaning out of your words .
Well , thank God I'm cured !
Now we wear the wreaths of victory on our heads .
People with too much invested in the world always get hurt .
What does You'd have a great hairstyle if you had .
But even so , I'll make doubly sure .
I don't like it that you knew about this , Iago .
Come on !
What's the matter ?
I'll come soon .
Farewell , farewell .
Farewell , King .
That he was never trained as a soldier .
I know how they think , and I understand why they're doing this .
You look like you have something more to say .
If the news is good , you're ruining the sweet news by playing a trick with a sour face like that .
Give my regards to your daughter .
Good morning , General .
He who is dizzy thinks the world is spinning" , please , tell me what you meant by that .
His absence means he's broken his promise , sir .
The servants of the Duke and my lieutenant ?
No .
Don't be upset .
Caesar , beware of Brutus .
You know where I'll be waiting .
My friend , your husband , the honest , honest Iago .
A little food and a huge welcome makes a joyous feast .
They're all dead .
You'll both help me , right ?
He sent me word that , whether I liked it or not , he liked it fine .
The queen wants you to chat with Laertes , politely , before you begin your match .
Come with me , I'll show you , and along the way , you can tell me where you live .
Help me here .
Please , Rosalind , my sweet cousin , be happy .
The curfew-bell rang .
Hurry , hurry !
It just happens , the way gentle rain drops on the ground .
You'll remain a prisoner until we bring your crimes to the Venetian government. , Okay , take him away .
If a bloody head counts as a hurt , then you hurt me .
Give me your present to give to Master Bassanio .
Let's take up the best positions we can in the valleys .
Yes , it is , I think .
There's no face more sincere than one washed in tears .
Carry him away .
He may command me as my king , but you still have power over me as a relative .
He has already been named king and has left for Scone to be crowned .
You've made up your mind , then ?
Murderer !
But do you really think the Prince would treat you that way ?
Yes , I am the one .
Will you marry us here , under this tree , or should we follow you to your chapel ?
I defy brain-death !
He must've heard that phrase describing some great man and now he's using it on a jester .
Oh , what a fall it was , my countrymen !
You speak more wisely than you know .
Why would Titania want to argue with her Oberon ?
I'd better stop up my ears against this siren's song .
Live a little , be comforted a little , cheer up a little .
I'm surprised my bland husband didn't meet me on the way here .
She's beautiful , if my eyes can see .
That man always looks so sour !
They were paid to betray their master .
You've said it well .
I'll never see the likes of him again .
And who can help thinking how monstrous it was for Malcolm and Donalbain to kill their gracious father ?
Listen to you !
We have to get out of here , old man .
I'll never speak to you again .
No , I'll go find some ditch to die in .
Can't I say something ?
Let's do it with no show of anxiety , no , with no more fear than if we'd heard that the English were busying themselves with folk dancing .
To have seen much but own nothing is to have rich eyes and poor hands .
I want to be friends with you , and forget all the times you've embarrassed and humiliated me .
Let heaven be my witness , I'm putting my mind , my heart , and my hands in Othello's control .
It was just two days ago that I tripped you and beat you up in front of the king .
We will , my noble lord .
Here is the money .
I had a son , whom I've legally disowned .
What could my sister's letter to him say ?
Be invisible to everyone except yourself and me .
She's still at the monastery , kneeling and praying for a happy marriage .
I saw Bassanio and Antonio say goodbye .
Come on , let's go inside .
Caesar has sent , Too slow a messenger .
Being satisfied with a job well done is payment enough .
How old is she ?
And at the base of Pompey's statue , with his cloak covering his face , which was dripping with blood the whole time , great Caesar fell .
But as for now , before two weeks have gone by , I'm going to send some people packing .
Yes Signior ?
I have as much of our father in me as you do , though I admit you're closer to him and matter more because you're older .
I would have my own brother arrested if he treated me so terribly .
Have the excavators stopped work ?
My grandmother told me he was murdered there .
And all because I use my own money to make a profit .
If not , I'll leave you alone and that'll be the end of my business .
How did she get that candle ?
Lord , Lord , she'll be a happy woman .
I'm locked up in a prison and deprived of food .
Here , catch this box .
Let me see Philostrate .
know myself !
In this world , I'm only taking up space .
The Turkish navy will be broken up .
If it's okay with you , you should not press your grievances any further , but realize that the current situation should be enough to reconcile you .
But whatever misfortunes occur , they can't ruin the joy I feel with one look at her .
No , we can just announce the actor's name , and let his face show through the lion costume , and have him say something himself .
No , you should tell him to hold his hands !
My father , led by a poor peasant ?
Well then , add some interjections that indicate laughter , like Hold on , Friar .
Then isn't it just the right dish for a sweet goose ?
He's a marvelously witty fellow , no doubt , but I'll outmaneuver him. , Come over here ; I'll whisper a word in your ear .
Oh , unfaithful lover !
I gave it to Dromio , who rushed in for it .
And when will that be ?
Can you hear me ?
Come on , come on .
Get out of here .
Why are you calling me "love" ?
Play some music while he chooses .
Consider how poorly this reflects on me .
Thoughts work so quickly that even now you can imagine him on Blackheath , where his lords suggest that he should carry his battle-scarred sword and helmet on a procession through the city .
What's his name ?
Go bring them here .
More shouting !
I swear to God it's true , sir .
I lent my body once to make him rich .
Your ghost walks the earth and turns our swords toward our own stomachs .
Most kind messenger , tell great Caesar that through his deputy I kiss his conquering hand .
Oh , Lord , this makes me laugh !
If the other two are as loopy as we are , our country's in bad shape .
Let's see .
Therefore , I beg your Highness , pardon me .
Who's shouting "murder" ?
He was the captain of a flimsy boat that was practically worthless because it was so small .
Can't you find a reason without my giving you one ?
Come , gentlemen , let's discuss tomorrow's action in my tent .
Sir , welcome to our house .
Get away from me , witch ! " the fat woman cried .
The French are still fighting .
He's very handsome .
It's difficult to bring two friends together , but even mountains can be moved together by earthquakes .
I think so .
Separate me from life with your sharp teeth .
If I owe you anything , I'll pay you in clubbings .
Leaving you is a thousand times worse than being near you .
Marcus Octavius , Marcus Justeius , Publicola , and Caelius will go by sea , but we'll keep the bulk on land .
You'll live in luxury with Gremio .
He's like a huge wheel on the top of the highest mountain whose spokes touch the rim of ten thousand smaller things , when it falls down the mountain , every little object goes down with it .
I'm going far enough that I'll be riding from now until dinner .
That is exactly why we wanted you here , your lordship , to avoid the public carping and complaints .
Why , what's the matter ?
Good-bye .
According to the laws of war , you didn't have to fight a stranger .
I can't speak any more .
Yes , he was .
It's fair game to mark a coward .
Indeed , we have many good days to look forward to !
Then no man has ever been honest .
We're ready for both , my lord .
Oh God , Horatio , what a damaged reputation I'm leaving behind me , as no one knows the truth .
That's the right attitude .
I'm very glad I came to see you .
Oh , Master , master , look !
Come with me .
No , not at all .
You thought you were being funny , but you said the truth .
The king sent us to give you his thanks and to bring you to him .
Captain Macmorris , I beg your pardon , but would you grant me a discussion or two with you , see , partly touching on or concerning the practice of war , the Roman wars , for the sake of argument , see , and friendly conversation ?
I can hardly keep myself from throwing things at him .
If you've been ordered back to Venice because of my father , don't blame me .
Even good men have bad luck .
How long do you plan to stay here in this forest ?
Where is she ?
Where's the jury , the judge , the lawful proceedings , the verdict ?
It's a trick to confuse us .

And me , too , my royal sovereign .
If he has my father's love , then that's enough honor for me .
Let's discuss it some more .
Your highness will have to force me to tell .
What do you think about this change ?
Should I strike it with my spear ?
Are Englishmen really such heavy drinkers ?
I scolded you for obsessing about her , not for loving her , my student .
What can I do for my lord ?
Control yourself , my precious Queen , and concede that my love is true .
Call the messengers !
I tell you , this house is as dark as ignorance .
I don't care what you think of me .
Come on , I'll take you , but honestly I'm only doing it out of pity .
Husband ?
Tell every soldier to break off a branch and hold it in front of him .
Please call him and tell him to come back here .
Are you really going to pretend you don't know me now ?
My dearest relative , I'm begging you , pull yourself together .
I don't know any fancy ways of talking about love , only to say right out , "I love you." If you press me any further than with the question , "Do you really ? " my love scene is over .
You haven't forgotten the half of a kingdom I gave you .
Thank you .
And I have much less to comfort me than you do , since I've lost my daughter .
All right , I will .
Four legs and two voices , a very special monster .
Here we'll shake hands good-bye .
But quiet , be quiet a minute .
Your brother's right-hand man .
Get up , liar .
Don't give it away .
Look how cheerful my mother is , only two hours after my father died .
Be patient until I finish .
She's dead , my Queen .
You don't know how quickly affection can be killed with a single nasty word .
He is positively stuffed with honorable virtues .
Why , anyone can see what this means .
But I won't attack a woman , even if she is a demon .
I'm everywhere .
But there's reason for me to look more closely at this schoolmaster .
Your wife , Fulvia , is dead .
I won't exhaust you anymore with idle chitchat .
Oh , really ?
Go home , you lazy men .
All right then , confess and live .
Can I have some ?
Is this true ?
But I still believe that his madness was caused by unrequited love. , Hello , Ophelia .
I swear to God , if I hadn't seen this with my own eyes I'd never believe it .
But did you see them dead ?
I must be as stupid as an ass , that's why I don't know her , but she knows me .
I don't know .
Go home to bed , Francisco .
What can I say ?
I'll go with you .
What on earth does that mean ?
Leave us .
And let me kill Cassio .
I still insisted on knowing what the matter was , but you wouldn't answer me , instead giving me an angry wave of your hand and telling me to leave you alone .
And its tears are wet .
I come to ask you out of charity to let us wander over this bloody field to record the numbers of our dead and bury them , separating our nobles from the common men , for many of our princes , alas ! , lie drowned and soaked in the blood of mercenary soldiers .
Plantagenet .
I know I can do it .
No .
You've got a sword , Gloucester .
Thank you for saying that , your Worship , but we're just the poor duke's officers .
Listen to this .
Everyone join hands .
Yes , Cassius .
My doors were locked and I was shut out , right ?
Oh , if it turns out to be true that he survived , then that storm was kind , and the ocean was full of love !
I'll have to tell the story again every month , since you seem to forget it .
May God's blessing go with you and with all who turn bad into good , and enemies into friends !
Tomorrow I'll be at the depths of my misery thinking about the happiness my brother has achieved , in having what he wished for .
Come , come , you are too clever for your own good .
Isn't that what he said ?
I'm sure he had more hair on his tail than I have on my face when I last saw him .
I don't think so .
I'd never play pranks on you .
Whenever I mention him , praise him more than any man deserves .
Let him sink there so the sea will cover him !
Fruits and vegetables don't ripen until the right season of the year .
I'll be bitter toward him , and curt .
Oh , that was unbelievably low !
I didn't , either .
You won't stand and fight .
If you got what you deserved , you would learn some respect .
Fair enough .
You lie , you nasty , ungrateful thing !
Who are they following ?
For now , don't try to persuade me anymore , I ask you as a friend .
It will rain tonight .
Chop off his head .
But give words a chance .
Here I lie and will never get up again .
I've never seen the waters so disturbed .
The dirt of a grave must cover your sweet eyes !
Do you make your living by playing that drum ?
It's your presence that draws out this blood from his empty veins .
Here he is .
He's my prisoner .
In exchange for the blood I shed for you then , I ask you for justice now .
I wonder that none of you thought about getting his support .
I don't know , " he said , "any house , wife , or mistress." My message , which was supposed to be delivered with my mouth , ended up being carried back home by my shoulders .
If God will be revenged for this deed , he will do it publicly .
Imagine the French ambassador returning to inform Harry that the king offers him
Wait a minute , Jew .
Your life has had honor in it .
Be careful , Signior Baptista , lest you be made the dupe in this business .
Goodbye , sir .
Look , look !
I'm as good a gentleman as the emperor .
Oh , sweet England !
Antonio , oh my dear Antonio !
By St. Paul , ghosts have struck more terror in my soul tonight than ten thousand of worthless Richmond's soldiers could , dressed up in their most sword-proof armor .
Let's listen to him .
Yes , just now , my lord .
Indeed , I remember it well .
Here comes his body , mourned by Mark Antony , who , though he had no part in the killing , will benefit from his death , receiving a share in the commonwealth , as you all will .
Barnardo's taken my place .
A little before twelve , I think .
Oh , Fate , come , come to me , with hands as pale as milk .
Remind Richard of this , and he will weep .
I'm telling you the truth .
Take away this fool , gentlemen .
You old traitor , repent all your sins .
And did you leave him like this ?
Boy , I beg you to run to the senate house .
Roderigo's been killed ?
Come with me .
This means we're having some mischievous fun .
Wake up the Montagues .
Well , I'm not beautiful , so I hope that I can at least be chaste .
Oh , life is full of surprises !
My pretty children , both of you misunderstand me .
Well , the Shall we get moving ?
Meanwhile , their They've said their prayers , and now they wait for death .
I don't want anything more .
I'm going .
I think I saw you there , you wise man .
And Cassius too .
He does , and now he's taking revenge on you , for breaking promises and for murder , too .
Shall we get to work ?
It's stopped now , it must be played for some local god of the island .
Good sir , stay close to me .
Do you think they're married ?
And if we don't shake hands , when I act all nice to the players it will seem like I'm happier to see them than you .
Run to your houses , fall on your knees , and pray to the gods to spare you the pain that you deserve for such ingratitude .
Who's that coming over here ?
I say a devil .
I wonder if the lion's going to talk .
Why are you so sad ?
Come on , Balthasar , let's hear that song again .
It took me two years before I had a single tooth .
Canidius , take our nineteen
If you ever loved your poor dear father , Oh God !
Why , he's the Prince's fool , and a very dull fool at that .
Yes , sir , but not when I'm enraged .
I've got no food to give you .
But in fact it doesn't say much .
Yes ?
I was engaged to her before I ever met Hermia .
It's time to leave .
Why , you scoundrel !
Enough !
Then tell them to treat us well .
But I don't hate Orlando .
Pardon us , dear father .
The Roman people are fed up with his arrogance already .
Oh , damn , damn , damn !
He's not a "master , " sir , he's just a poor man's son .
No , I'm telling you , put on this robe and beard .
By the way , I'm going home tomorrow , Sir Toby .
We'll eat at her place .
Good morning , Kate , for I hear that's what you're called .
The world is a bad place , where you can't speak what you know .
And how did she react to all this ?
No , sir .
Shame , eternal shame , and nothing but shame !
You look happier already , and I'll be back quickly .
I'm sure he's been kidnapped .
Fortune is happy today and , in this mood , will give us anything we want .
his daughter , Katherine , with some insignificant , unprofitable dukedoms as her dowry .
Your worst fault is being in love .
Finally the new moon , curved like a silver bow in the sky , will look down on our wedding celebration .
My Lord Constable , are those stars or suns I saw on the armor in your tent tonight ?
It's only just now nine o'clock .
My heart feels like it's about to explode .
Yes , but no doctor can help me .
You can relax , ma'am .
That's Signior Baptista , will you really be this cruel ?
Go to the tomb of your great-grandfather , from whom your own title to the crown derives .
But go on .
For instance , our husbands
Each day new widows howl , new orphans cry , and new sorrows slap heaven in the face , until it sounds like heaven itself feels Scotland's anguish and screams in pain .
How is your majesty doing ?
So I Your Honor's actors , hearing of your recovery , have come to perform a pleasing comedy for you , and your doctors approve wholeheartedly .
Tell me , spirit , how's the king and his entourage ?
Yes , sir , they're ready .
Punish me if it's not true .
I promise .
I'm ready now .
In the meantime , think about how I can do you good and give you what you want .
He's full of wise sayings and up-to-the-minute anecdotes : that's the way he plays his part .
The wind you're talking about is blowing us off our course .
Oh Dardanius !
It's still a long time until daybreak .
I said so , dear Katherine , and I'm not ashamed to repeat it .
I don't have the cash right now .
If I do so , it will mean more if I say it behind your back than if I say it to your face .
I can't say "whore." It makes me sick to say the word even now .
Please take them off .
Where's he going ?
Why won't he ?
Have you forgotten who I am ?
I'm at your service , madam .
Go to your tomb !
We'll put a picture of you on a sign , right above the words "Come see the tyrant ! " I'm not going to surrender and have to kiss the ground in front of Malcolm , or be taunted by the common people .
But these days , people give each other their hands without their hearts .
And brief , good mother , I'm in a hurry .
The point is that she didn't write this letter .
What's up , Catesby , what does your master say ?
The sweetest nut has the sourest rind And Rosalind is that kind of nut .
They're pretty busy in there .
It's come again .
I dreamt about this .
Please , one of you go ask that man over there if we can buy some food off him .
May heaven save us from indecent thoughts !
That rotten scoundrel !
Oh well .
What will we say is our excuse for being here ?
She already has a face .
As I remember , Henry the Sixth prophesied that Richmond would be king when Richmond was only a foolish little boy .
And she screamed at me , right ?
No .
Our wedding banquet will become a sad burial feast .
Hey , hurry up , hurry up !
We'll have supper in the morning .
You are as well provided in both respects as any prince in the world .
When are you getting married , madam ?
Let's do that .
Edmund , you deserve me to be your woman .
Where is he ?
He's dressed like a freak , a total freak , and not at all like a proper footman or a gentleman's valet .
Octavia has a pious , chaste , meek disposition .
And you called the fairy creature harmless , monster .
Why , to keep the eyes on the sides , so that you can see anything that you can't sniff out .
And what do you know , boy ?
I'm being gentle with you , because I'm one of those good-hearted people who are polite to the devil himself .
I want you to do some things for our wedding , and I also want to discuss something that concerns you both .
Would I ever deny you anything ?
Lock yourself in and send him word that you're dead .
Do you think it would work ?
He has brought you figs .
I will , sir .
Go on .
Tie up his withered old arms .
Before I saw Lysander , Athens seemed like paradise to me .
Well , then , put your sword away .
But I have known people who sleepwalked and weren't guilty of anything .
Now I see that all three of them have gotten together to play this cruel trick on me .
What are you doing , wearing your best clothes ?
You should ask me what time of day it is , instead .
I haven't done anything wrong .
Farewell , good neighbor .
Oh , no !
Yes , and I'll give it to him for free .
I was afraid this would happen , because he was a noble , brave man , but I didn't think he had a weapon .
It starts , "Shut up." I'll never be able to start if I shut up .
Don't leave me in the lurch .
Be sad only at the fact that you'll lose your friend , your friend doesn't regret that he paid your debt .
Now , you tanned fieldworkers who are so tired of August's labors , get out of the dirt and come rejoice with us here .
It's pointless to talk now .
I hope you have good weather to set your mind at ease .
So what's going on ?
Fight ?
I thank my heart , the poor fool , for it keeps away from seriousness .
He rushed away on serious business .
What should I call you when you're a man ?
Why Dover ?
I'm the man she wants .
The honest men .
Which of you has been complaining to the king that I don't like them ?
He knows that you didn't embrace Antony because you loved him , but because you feared him .
Well , I'm glad about this .
Oh , I wish I could sleep again , so I could have another dream like that !
I'm forty-eight .
Give me your hand .
So have your money ready .
Could the lead one contain it ?
One of your tears is worth everything that was won and lost .
Why ?
I won't deny him anything of mine , including my own body and my husband's bed .
Damn him !
I'm glad about that .
You'd be the funniest person in Illyria, if Sir Toby ever stopped drinking .
Excuse me , my lord ?
Should I get your nightgown ?
But if you have the stomach for it , you'll have all the help from me you need .
To this day , the kings of France follow this unspoken rule , even though they point to this Salic law to bar your Highness from inheriting it through the female line .
Oh , well .
In my soul , I believe Hero has been falsely accused .
How are you going to live ?
Don't get up yet .
Good evening to your Worship , good Captain James .
I have a good plan .
Who's calling me ?
My letters say only seventy senators were killed , one being Cicero .
There comes an old man with his three sons , It sounds like the beginning of an old folktale .
It's worthless .
She's dead to me .
Queen of Egypt , greetings !
Did she see you there the whole time , old boy ?
If my lips had the power to give life , I would wear them out like this .
But you turn that sun into a shadow .
What is it , Biondello ?
Don't trouble him further until his mind is more settled .
Go back with her ?
Keep it from leaving , Marcellus .
I'd bet fourteen of my own teeth , but , I'm sorry to say , I only have four teeth , she's not fourteen .
Why , last night .
I don't like his face .
It will heal and be as good as new , and we'll be threatened by its fangs once again .
Treat Desdemona well .
We didn't expect Mark Antony to be here .
Don't worry about me not swearing enough .
You can't trust anyone who abuses her own father , her flesh and blood .
What infinite peace do king's give up that private men enjoy ?
Well , her name's a word , and if you fooled around with it you might make her into a whore .
I am tired .
I won't betray them .
I wasn't invited because they like me .
If your wife's not a madwoman , and you tell her how much I deserve this ring , she won't stay angry at you forever if you give it to me .
You are welcome , sir .
Nonsense .
Here it is .
For there never was a pretty woman who didn't like to preen in the mirror .
How can it seem like I'm making fun of you , when my tears prove that I'm sincere ?
Then think about how shameful it would be for you to give in to his seductive talk and surrender your treasure chest to his greedy hands .
We'll start a fire .
You won't get any bad cooks from me .
I'll tell them where you come from , though I don't know who you are or what you want .
Well , well .
He thinks highly of me .
No epilogue , please .
I'm going to sell all my land .
You're lying .
Mark Antony , should we give the signal to attack ?
I can't recall where I slept last night .
You know , he got me in trouble with the lady of the house once when I arranged a bear-baiting here .
If a Jew offends a Christian , what's the Christian's kind and gentle reaction ?
All because of what happened to that brat Rutland ?
Edward's healing touch is a miracle that I have seen him perform many times during my stay in England .
A veteran commander and a very kind gentleman .
And as you said ( and you said it wisely ) , it's good to have someone other than a mother listening in on them , since she can be too partial to him .
Indeed , she gives a very good testimony of the snake's power .
And I swear to God he's very smart .
Oh earth , which soaks up this blood , revenge his death !
Remove your armor , Eros .
This man looks like his business is urgent .
That's how it will be for some other men , too , who think they're as safe as you and I , who are well-loved by noble Richard and Buckingham .
Go relax now .
Carry him gently to bed , and every man be ready at his post when he awakes .
We can't all be masters , and not all masters should be followed .
How are you doing , Cassio ? , Someone bring me a stretcher !
Bad times ?
Can't what , my lord ?
I beg your pardon .
Then every soldier must kill his prisoners .
An Englishman ?
Most formidable Queen !
The rest of the king's guests are already inside .
Here's mine .
For lawyers on vacation , because they sleep their holidays away , with no sense of how time moves .
Listen , Clitus .
Yes , from Normandy .
My lord , I have thought over the request you just made of me .
Here , sir !
Well , time is the old judge that tries your kind of criminal .
Don't try to tempt me !
The truth will be all the inheritance you get .
You slander her , you devil .
From down here , I thought his eyes looked like full moons .
The groans you used to make are still ringing in my old ears .
People who die of it seldom or never recover .
Then know that from my soul I love your daughter .
I am not made of stone ; I am affected by all these kind pleas , though it goes against my conscience and my soul .
Go to sleep , and listen to us laughing .
Are you really saying these things , or am I dreaming ?
What soldiers , fool ?
But I swear I'm not the person I'm playing .
If I'm killed , it will only be the death of a man who was willing to be dead .
Call it a match !
Rome has lost the ability to raise noble men !
Back when I was a schoolboy , if I lost an arrow I would try to find it by shooting another arrow in the same direction , watching the second arrow more carefully than I had the first .
You don't want to eat , sir ?
So she is drowned .
She gave up her life with your name still within her .
Take up the sword again , or take me up .
He doesn't have children .
I hear their drums .
rules my life." Hmm , let me see , let me see , let me see .
I'll send a man to Mantua , where that exiled rogue is living .
I'll leave you , lady .
And is everyone who swears and lies a traitor ?
You'll take the mustard or you'll get no beef from Grumio .
I won't answer that .
I hope you think I'm faithful to you .
Except that he has not yet agreed to address you in this form and with this title , in French , And even this I'm willing to grant if you request it .
We should speak what we feel , not what we ought to say .
The dog returns to its own vomit , and the newly washed sow to its mud puddle." You'd take anything for a mistress .
No , my good lord .
I say it's the moon .
But don't let me keep you from going , Cassius .
There isn't enough leek left for you to swear on .
I would give all my glory for a mug of ale and safety .
My lord !
You , Nick Bottom , have been cast as Pyramus .
Excuse me .
It's my daughter !
And you're not to utter a syllable of Tranio's name .
May God's arm strike on our side !
I have no more royal sons for you to murder .
We won't , sir .
You'll never hear from the herald again .
Howl , howl , howl , howl !
Borachio .
Have you seen Master Lorenzo !
Indeed I do , sir , and I've come to let you in on a certain problem .
By the way , if I were to compose an extra speech of twelve to sixteen lines and stick it into the play , you could learn it by heart for tomorrow , right ?
He knows no more about the proper practice of war , see , the ancient practices , than a puppy .
Unhappy fortune !
It must be something I did accidentally .
Both ?
Won't you tell me who told you that ?
I want my bond .
One more time , we proclaim this publicly : If anyone will pay this man's bail , he will not be put to death .
I beg your pardon , sirs. , Please tell me your name , sir ?
We will speak about this further .
No , and she swears she never will .
Follow it , follow it !
Since you're giving me new assignments , let me remind you what you promised me but haven't come through with yet .
This haunting business is even stranger than murder .
My mask is like the roof of the poor
Oh , now you weep , and I sense that you feel pity .
I'm not a doddering old fool who brags about the things he did when he was young , and what he would do now if he weren't so old .
Give me a little breathing space , my lord , a little pause to think .
It's good to grow .
Your friends at Pomfret , they're the ones who need a priest .
Where's Dolabella ?
My master and my lord !
That's treason !
I'm serving under him to take advantage of him .
The handkerchief !
I am dying , Cleopatra , dying .
So did I .
Thank you .
Your features , God help us !
He says she has no equal .
It's half of all my money .
The rest of my life will be nothing but bitterness .
Have they come back ?
Tybalt was my dearest cousin .
I speak to you as a plain soldier .
I wish I had never seen it !
How dare you serve it to me this way !
Referee !
Yes .
Here .
You're a cobbler , are you ?
No , I'm sure your Grace won't be able to persuade him to try a second round , even though you couldn't dissuade him from trying the first .
She said something she shouldn't have said , I'm sure of that .
Where are they ?
Okay , but tonight doesn't count .
The wildest animal isn't as cruel as you are .
I hate it when I hear a blustery actor in a wig tear a passion to shreds , bursting everyone's eardrums so as to impress the audience on the lower levels of the playhouse , who for the most part can only appreciate loud noises and pantomime shows .
Get that fool out of here .
He is indeed worthy of the name "horse , " and you can call all the rest beasts .
Madam , I'm here .
Procreation is a good thing , but if your daughter gets pregnant , look out , friend .
His legs aren't great , but they're alright .
My husband said she was unfaithful !
Why are they shouting ?
Now , I swear by Saint Peter's Church and Peter too , he will not make me a joyful bride there .
Oh , to think you've been rejected !
How could he be in debt without me knowing it ?
What have you found out ?
I'm very glad .
Call the numbskull back in here .
If you like , we'll stand by and wait to do whatever you need .
By Jesus , he will defend his position on the practices of the ancient Roman wars as well as any military man in the world .
Yes , be content , good Touchstone .
Cut my corset laces , Charmian , so I can breathe .
How horrible !
She's not even fourteen .
Ask your daughters for another one .
Anyway , sir , should I go see the lady ?
The poor thing , I really think she loves me .
How could I forget , my lord !
You come from heaven , don't you ?
What time is it ?
I'm not Stephano , I'm a walking cramp .
So get prepared .
I can't wait to meet her !
I know a lot about the love women can feel for men .
No , you were one of Gneius Pompey's leftovers , not to mention your other , more depraved affairs , which have somehow managed to avoid becoming the subject of vulgar gossip .
The graceful and renowned king is dead .
You have guessed exactly what I feared .
Tell me why you did it .
Won't the dawn come from here ?
You're the beautiful one as far as Demetrius is concerned .
Again , goodbye .
Well , I'm the man you're speaking of .
Think about it .
Take care .
So the cooks who can't lick their fingers aren't hired .
And what is the subject ?
Where's Publius ?
Tell me to tear up this contract .
Oh , my daughter !
To die , to sleep , to sleep , maybe to dream .
No , I have a commitment .
What do you think of these quick-witted folks , Gremio ?
Young man , when you wake up , if she's nearby , beg her to cure your lovesickness .
Farewell , and thanks .
Oh , no question , it won't style itself .
In fact , every imprisoned man holds in his own hand the tool to free himself .
It's not because I don't love you .
No , lovely princess .
Ha ?
I don't even know how much I'm spending to find them .
Sir , I'm puzzled by what you just said .
You are too expensive to wear every day .
Oh what a curse marriage is !
And then he'll , he'll , wait , what was I about to say ?
Haven't you ever heard the saying , "Two can conspire to put one away" ?
And I won't be there either. , Edmund , I'm told you've acted like a true son to your father .
Is the army without a leader ?
But I don't get it , what's the joke ?
For you , I give myself away and I'm ecstatic about the exchange .
It would be much appreciated .
I'm more like an ancient Roman than a corrupt modern Dane .
The law fully authorizes the penalty , which you have to pay according to the contract .
Go get money .
Thrice noble lord , I beg you to excuse me for another night or two , or at least until nightfall .
It's going to be fun , I promise .
Hurry up , it's getting late .
Please make him change his mind .
What's keeping you ?
Amen .
Oh righteous God , how can I thank you enough that this meat-eating mutt preys on his mother's children and forces her to join others in their grief !
I'll find him right away , sir , and carry out the business as well as I can .
Kind gentlemen , I won't forget the trouble you've taken for me whenever I think of this day .
Well , but what time is it ?
She's not good enough for you , then .
Oh , sad day !
After you , my lords ?
You're not taking one step toward an enemy .
Caesar was a tyrant .
We can't wait here .
When it comes to defense , it's best to assume that the enemy is more powerful than he seems .
Good night .
Your heart's going to break .
Quiet , you stupid fool .
I'm sorry , my friend .
We have two hours to get ready .
I am not in the giving mood today .
Get to it , be lustful , sleep around , I need soldiers for my army .
Go with my brothers to my English peers .
And I believe , unless this brain of mine is not so politically cunning as it used to be , that I've found out why Hamlet's gone crazy .
When I was putting on the Ceres show , I thought of reminding you about Caliban , but I was afraid of upsetting you .
Where is he ?
Gremio , this is no time to compete over how deeply we love Bianca .
Now , before God , our whole city owes this friar a great debt .
You sound like a pack of wolves howling at the moon .
How will you wreck this marriage ?
Are you an actor ?
What do you have to say to me ?
My lord , you know I'm your friend .
He's quite simply the smartest working-man in Athens .
She can hide there and eavesdrop on our conversation .
No one should have an honor he doesn't deserve .
It's a very sad day .
Are you insane ?
But what a fool I am to stand here chatting when I should bid good morning to my bride and seal the bargain with a loving kiss .
Oh , she could sing a wild bear to sleep !
I want to avoid that .
Don't worry , sir .
My sweet husband , I did not lock you out .
Yes , my lord .
You've done a good job , that other men can attribute their murders to you !
Swear by my sword .
But don't think I'm doing this because I'm greedy .
You knew that my sword , weakened by my love for you , would obey that love no matter what .
How handsome it is .
Your Juliet is alive .
Well , did you think about what I said ?
Come on , close the curtain , Nerissa .
Oh , I don't know .
Good roaring , Lion !
I'd rather adopt a child than have one of my own. , Come here , Moor .
He was a great human being .
No thanks , my good mother .
She replied by saying that it would be better for him to be her guest instead .
That's what made him crazy .
He refuses to admit what everyone else knows .
I heard the galloping of horses .
Young man , have you challenged Charles the Wrestler ?
In my travels , great scholars have come up to me , meaning to greet me with well-rehearsed welcoming speeches , and I have seen them tremble and turn pale , and pause inappropriately in the middle of their sentences , and botch their well-rehearsed tones of voice because they're so nervous , and then break off abruptly at the end , without actually welcoming me .
The prayers of saints and those that Richard wronged support us like high-walled fortresses .
When you are gentle , you shall have one , too , and not till then .
Yes .
Let's say goodbye to him .
Your servant Kent .
I think there must be something invigorating about death , since she dies with such enthusiasm .
What does he say about our marriage ?
But you must learn to recognize such liars , or you will be greatly taken advantage of .
I've almost missed the time he requested .
I wish I was your bird .
The person who's poor and contented is rich enough .
I'll get there .
I'll be back quicker than you can think a thought .
Seriously , I think our clothes are as fresh now as they were the day we put them on in Africa , when we attended the marriage of the king's daughter Claribel to the King of Tunis .
Good morning , Brutus .
And death , not Romeo , can take my virginity !
But let me place this wreath on your head .
With this I avoid the grief of Antony's death .
We'll give you an answer tomorrow .
Yes , you are .
Sir , my king , don't waste your time mulling over how strange this business is .
Me too , my lord .
Pray God your wife doesn't send you a worse one .
I swear , at the moment I really couldn't tell you how I ended up here .
You haven't heard of the war brewing between the Dukes of Cornwall and Albany ?
The total due is about three ducats more than I owe this gentleman .
Yes , just like this .
Open your gates .
I hope luck will give me what my heart hopes for !
You agreed to send me troops and weapons when I needed them .
I'll try to persuade him to put on something more appropriate before going to the church , if it's at all possible .
Hands , speak for me !
What time is it ?
Sweet mistress , I don't know what other name to give you , or how you've figured out mine , you seem as
Up and down , up and down , I will lead them up and down .
Tell me right now and stop fooling : where's the money ?
And if your clothes were as thin as mine , you'd really feel the air .
Why , dear me , Kate !
Benedick , did you notice Signior Leonato's daughter ?
God will free you from blame .
Yes , but I know , What do you know ?
That's where I'm going now , so I'll leave you here .
Naked in bed together , but without doing anything ?
Doesn't Benedick deserve as much luck with a mate as he would have with Beatrice ?
Why are you acting so angry ?
Am I really like one of those guys ?
May they relieve a sick old man's suffering .
What crimes happen so early in the morning that I have to wake up before the usual time ?
And everything will be alright , I promise you , wife .
When I opened my eyes , I saw their swords out .
Within the next three days I want to hear you tell me that Cassio's dead .
That's for to me to decide .
Send me away ?
The prince of Arragon has taken his oath , and he's coming to make his choice now .
Don't come near till you hear me call you .
Just looking at him gives me heartburn .
Soundly , my lord .
Was Queen Cordelia aggrieved by the letters you delivered ?
Why , may I ask ?
What , that's all ?
Then it looks like Macbeth will become king .
Are you rich ?
What ?
It was a huge mistake to let old Gloucester live after we blinded him .
By my count , I was already your mother at just about your age , while you remain a virgin .
Bring them to me .
Say welcome to all of our friends for me , sir , for in my heart they are all welcome .
And even though Nature has given us the wit to have this argument , hasn't Fortune sent this fool here to stop us ?
Whoever is already married ( except one person I know ) will stay married , all but one person .
I take all responsibility for my decisions .
If you say that , you'll only be telling the truth .
Who's ruining my rituals of true love ?
I swear on my life that I'm speaking the truth .
So , take me , death !
Just listen to him .
Stop , sir , for God's sake !
Your husband's mad , isn't he ?
I'll do most of the drinking for you .
Really ?
Alright , then I'll see you at Philippi .
You're doing the right thing .
You're wrong , sir , very wrong .
Don't say anything bad about wine anymore .
Hold your peace .
We might as well send orders to the whale to come ashore as try to restore order in soldiers carried away with their looting .
A fortunate coincidence , more fortunate for your son .
Wake up when something nasty is nearby .
Very suspicious .
What's that noise ?
From there we'll safely carry you to France and back , calming the waters of the Channel to provide you with a smooth voyage .
You've never seen anything like it .
Your complaint against me is perfectly understandable , but I still insist I've done everything I could to help you .
The hour has almost come when I have to return to the horrible flames of purgatory .
She's calling out my name as if I were a bullet murdering her , just like I murdered her relative .
But leave it all to God .
Madam !
Oh , how fortunate that horse is to have Antony on him .
When the vision passes , you'll see that you're just looking at a stool .
There she is , over there .
What evil things were done to us that we were driven here ?
No , let them go .
Fight it like a man .
Give my answer to them both .
This is what happened : he and Cleopatra sat on chairs of gold on a silver-covered stage in the marketplace .
You evil whore !
Get me a surgeon !
Do you have the lion's part written down ?
Sir , I know I'm not a flatterer .
I'll take comfort in my books and music , reading and practicing my instruments .
My story does raise that question .
What three things does drink make a man do ?
But listen , if
Can she give that away too ?
Arms , make your last embrace !
Therefore , love each other in moderation .
In a fit of rage she locked you up in a hollow pine tree , with the help of her powerful assistants , and left you there for twelve years .
Amen , amen .
Why are you knocking so hard ?
I don't know what "poetical" means .
What did you say to me ?
One of you run to the Queen with the news .
The Egyptian snake is born when the sun shines on the Nile mud , just like the crocodile .
I know you know something about how excellent Laertes is ,
The queen is here on special business , and her army has moved on .
Cheer up , good Adam .
If they do fight , I hope Lysander is safe !
Music , listen !
It warms my heart to encounter such a country bumpkin .
Only until noon , my lord ?
I loved him , as much as any father ever loved his son .
You saw eternity in my lips and eyes , and happiness in the arch of my eyebrows .
If he's not around , bring his brother Oliver to me .
We're close enough now .
I know exactly how to proceed .
Why , what's the problem ?
Halt !
What , you ignore my kind advice and try to please the devil I'm warning you about ?
And , just in time , here comes the sweaty lord .
No , he comes to be married Lady , do you come here to be married to this count ?
Oh , I only wish I knew the name of that husband you said he predicted will have a cheating wife !
Do you see ?
That's definitely true , my lord .
But I'm as noble as my opponent .
Where is your husband ?
If there is , then heaven help him !
He's dreaming .
While the armed hand fights in foreign lands , the wise head defends itself at home .
Their guilt is finally starting to gnaw at them , like a slow-acting poison .
Her grapes , which make the wine that cheers our hearts , die unpruned on the vines .
But who is this person , sir ?
In just an hour from now , Duchess of York , I'll be saluting you as the mother of two beautiful queens .
Good Mr. Peaseblossom , I'd like to get to know you better too. , And you , may I ask what your name is , sir ?
Good-bye , kind Charmian .
Well , what's your plan ?
If you'll take a simple man's advice , don't be here when it arrives .
It was two o'clock when I left him , and now it's one .
Nobody but the fool , who's trying to soothe the wounds in the king's heart with jokes .
Call him !
Sir , I know you , and I trust you enough to share something very important with you .
Ouch , what a comeback !
Tell me , how did you get in here ?
Thomas Grey , knight , of Northumberland , I arrest you for high treason .
Well , I hope not .
I know you for what you really are , but as your sister I'm reluctant to criticize you .
It's my duty to be quiet .
If it were , you would find me such an ordinary king that you would think I'd sold my farm to buy my crown .
Your overwhelming kindness makes me weep .
It's a good thing I'm like a little pot and warm up quickly , or else my lips themselves would freeze and stick to my teeth , my tongue to the roof of my mouth , and my heart would freeze in my belly , before I managed to get thawed out .
The English army , sir .
On the platform where we stand guard , sir .
My lord ?
Our reasons are so well considered that even if you , Antony , were Caesar's son , you would be satisfied with them .
What should we do with all these rhyming fools that follow us from post to post ?
Strato , you've slept this whole time .
Is that true ?
What do you want from me ?
She sent Dromio to bring you home for lunch .
I hereby grant your request , and hope you have a good time .
He's trembling in his fit !
Who sent you this time ?
When you see leeks in the future , I hope you keep mocking them .
That whore ?
Be sure to burn his magic books .
Wait , look !
Don't you think you should go to bed , Malvolio ?
For more important things , you'll say no .
Here comes the messenger with your niece .
Not even to get her fan , or her gloves , or her mask , or anything ?
Put him within the reach of my sword , and if he escapes , may heaven forgive him as well !
Why do you look so depressed today , your Grace ?
How will I recognize you in the future ?
I heard the news , my lord .
It should work .
You seem to be a good person , captain , and although people who look beautiful are often corrupt inside , I believe that you have a beautiful mind to go with your good looks and manners .
And there's a messenger representing a fifth one , the prince of Morocco , who says the prince will be here tonight .
How is she doing ?
If you are human , don't stand for it .
You gave us the slip , sir , the slip .
And good ones , too .
Remember you !
Yes , you would beg , if you were in my position .
Because that's what you are now .
I'll keep your words of wisdom close to my heart .
Tell me what you want .
I've been informed by certain sources I can't disclose that your younger brother Orlando plans to fight me in disguise .
Why , what a complicated case this is !
That's not good .
But what love could make my Lysander leave me ?
I'll wait for you in your cave , where you can tell me what you need from me .
And I'll turn you into a spirit like us , so you won't die as humans do. , Come here , Peaseblossom , Cobweb , Moth , and Mustardseed !
You're so attractive when you smile .
He mixed that poison himself .
My friends , are you all Lady Olivia's servants ?
Or , rather , I'll kill you , or I'll do away with you , or I'll turn your life into death and your freedom into captivity .
He's welcome here .
Why are you here ?
You evil thief , where have you hidden my daughter ?
There's my hat !
I shouldn't make you do more than you're able .
Mark Antony will say I'm not well , and to please you I'll stay at home .
The blows I gave you already will make up for your upsetting me .
Yet not one among them , if all three were to wait on me , could be my "man , " because three such fakes don't amount to a man .
Horns ?
Men's faces are truthful , whatever their hands do .
You have to contradict me , do you ?
Which one of you is the lady of the house ?
Malvolio , your vanity is damaging your good taste .
Damn it , who's there ?
Thank you , madam .
No , sir , I won't let you go .
Let me wipe it off first .
Besides , I have some business to take care of in town .
So you took pleasure in bringing me this message ?
Therefore , great king , we surrender our town and lives to your kind mercy .
Who are you ?
I'll make Oliver find him .
If you behave yourself and join us in our circle dance and moonlight celebrations , then you can come with us .
So be it , Dolabella .
I'll let you know my answer shortly .
Do you even know what you're talking about ?
Good heavens !
I know him well .
I know he wouldn't be a wolf if the Romans didn't act like sheep .
I'll find Romeo to comfort you .
Therefore , when he has reason to fear , as we do , his fears are without question of the same order .
You're thought to be the most
You've forgotten the will I told you about .
So when should he come ?
Choose another tack .
Where's your master ?
It's true .
Madam , there's a young gentleman at the gate who really wants to speak to you .
No , by our Lady , I don't think he can .
Yes .
Let's draw our own swords too .
Well , what was your dream ?
Unfortunately , I love myself .
Stop eating ?
Good-bye .
Your mother was extremely virtuous , and she said you were my daughter .
it pleases you , I'll meet you in the marketplace at five and will keep you company until bedtime .
That he felt for me the love that I begged him to feel for you .
What are you talking about ?
Now he lies there worth nothing , and no one is so humble as to show him respect .
As I slept under this yew-tree here , I had a dream that my master and someone else were fighting and that my master killed him .
Let's dance to "You Jerk." You mean , "Shut up , you jerk" ?
I'll go straight for that proverb with "To hell with the devil." You are better at proverbs than I am by as much as "A fool shoots quickly and overshoots his mark." You have overshot .
It's his wife , Lady Grey , who got him to do this .
Listen to my reasons and be silent so you can hear .
It looks that way .
You should let others take care of you and submit to people who know better than you do what's good for you .
Here comes your father .
Don't bring me any more reports .
My granddaughter , with her kind aunt , the duchess of Gloucester , leading her by the hand ?
Will your Majesty grant us permission to freely express the message we've been asked to convey ?
Show me .
Look how she rubs her hands .
My lord , Hamlet's going to his mother's room .
Dear Duke , please listen to what I have to say .
That's why I've begged him to come on our shift tonight , so that if the ghost appears he can see what we see and speak to it .
Good-bye then , until the time I see you dressed in your battle gear , which will suit you both very well .
If you hang around me for two more years , you'll forget the sound of your own voice .
I'm not sleepy at all .
Wish I could say the same .
A good name .
Oh , you're sticking a dagger in me !
You want me to say what I'm thinking ?
He's the color of nutmeg .
The noise is coming from over there .
There's a picture of me inside .
Apparently you think there's nothing unusual about a bloody head .
The king , his brother , and your brother are all waiting there in a crazed state of mind , and the rest are grieving over them , sad and astonished .
I won't fight you .
Oh , Luciana , did he tempt you like that ?
I'll go get them , sir .
What's the prize ?
Hurry up , my Jewish friend .
When was there ever before so great a loss on one side and so little on the other , in the ordinary and equal clash of battle ?
Doesn't a Jew eat the same food , get hurt with the same weapons , get sick with the same diseases , get healed by the same medicine , and warm up in summer and cool off in winter just like a Christian ?
Why , his cuckold's horns , of course , the kind you men are always blaming on your wives .
The king has broken his heart .
Get out of here , you measly , lying wretch .
Victory is with us .
He says his name's Poor Tom .
It used to be the last ditch comfort of miserable people .
Listen , please , give me the necklace .
I have more reason to be distressed .
What kind of god is ceremony , which suffers more than its worshippers do ?
Wait , don't rush !
You're going to ask me why I'd rather have a pound of decaying flesh than three thousand ducats .
Yes , and she was mild too .
Myself ?
Do you know anyone who would kill someone for money ?
His glory has not been diminished where he earned it , nor have those offenses for which he was killed been exaggerated .
Why , here is the order to prove it .
They commanded me to lock my doors and leave you out in this merciless storm , but I've come out here to find you and take you where there's warmth and food .
I had you figured for a piece of furniture .
Aren't things going well ?
Oh , he was gentle , mild , and virtuous .
How old is he ?
I could swear this is the real Vincentio .
I grow old , and all dignity has been thrashed out of me .
I'll show you where to get fresh water .
Would it be better if I were that , instead of what I am ?
Show me , or at least prove it beyond the shadow of a doubt .
No , really , I don't .
I swear , he'll be food for the crows soon .
You lie .
Sit between us .
Oh , but I think of him more highly than I say I do , and I wish he looked worse in other women's eyes .
But if I gave my wife a handkerchief , Then what ?
I swear , sir , you did not eat at home .
Draw your sword , you jerk !
Help us , good friends .
May the devil turn you black , you white-faced fool !
Why are you bothering this poor man !
I bet she'll chew him out .
Caesar is upset .
That's true .
I must tell you then .
Shush , sir , please !
If his face changed as much as his personality has , I wouldn't recognize him .
I'm all right .
Help me , ladies !
Don't talk to me .
Yes , ma'am .
This much I can say about him : he is well-born , has proven his bravery in battle , and has established his good character .
Hortensio , what's all this about ?
As long as there are
Yes , it's Emilia .
This chatter is no cure for my toothache .
If they see you , they'll murder you .
I had my father's signet ring in my pocket , with the royal seal of Denmark on it .
You can refuse to make me your spouse , but I'll be your servant whether you want me to or not .
Let thunder flatten the spherical world , crack open all the molds from which nature forms human beings , and spill all the seeds from which ungrateful humans grow !
But if you have sex with her before the marriage ceremony takes place , the heavens will not bless your relationship , but will overwhelm you with hate , contempt , and discord , and will poison your marriage bed so that you both grow to loathe it .
No .
Who are you , moaning in the hut like that ?
Very well , ma'am .
Well , in and of itself , it is a good life , but given that it's a shepherd's life , it's worthless .
But his navy rules the sea .
Is it a habit of his ?
I'm happy about that .
But if you decide not to marry me , you'll marry this faithful shepherd instead ?
This is a miracle , if you talk of miracles .
Can't you wait for a moment ?
But my personal motivation , and that which should move you most to sanction my departure , is that Fulvia is dead .
I remember he's already occupied .
No , I'll be patient .
I will lower my voice .
And since we dream at night , time passes quickly then .
It's pathetic to be Caesar .
Why is my lord enraged against his love ?
But Macbeth is .
It's not for me to say .
Where's Metellus Cimber ?
Set fire !
Have you killed Tybalt ?
John Duke of Norfolk and Thomas Earl of Surrey will lead the horsemen and foot soldiers .
And no one eat any onions or garlic .
Once at Sardis and once last night , here in Philippi fields .
Forgive me .
Why does he talk like that to a girl he can't stand ?
Everyone keeps yelling , "Here they come ! " Our castle is strong enough to laugh off their seige .
Why are you waiting ?
I'm glad to hear it .
Hortensio and I have given you up .
But the devil that tempted you gave you no reason why you should commit treason other than to win the name of traitor .
I'll miss you , Ariel , but you'll be free. , Yes , you will , yes. , Go to the king's ship in your invisible state .
How are you doing , brother ?
Descend .
Me too .
We would profane the other dead souls here if we sang the same requiem for her that we sang for them .
Octavia weeps at the thought of leaving Rome .
Call in the messengers sent from the Dauphin .
Excuse me , weren't you with Countess Olivia just now ?
Yes , please ; unleash your wisdom .
Buckingham himself has wandered away alone to who knows where .
Hello !
Come on , let's go to prison .
Oh , do not wish one more !
The moon has set .
Who's that ?
Oh , why is this so ?
Besides , he brings his fate with him .
Flies are like free men , but I have been banished .
Madam !
Look , she's spotted him with those sweet eyes of hers .
According to what I heard , they had no travel plans as of last night .
If you refuse me , the laws of Venice have no validity .
I could live a thousand years and I wouldn't be as ready to die as I am now .
I know my medicine will work on him .
No , my good lord .
He's crying out for you and swears he'll burn your face and disfigure you if he can get ahold of you .
What can I give you that you want , my lord , except the one thing you can't have ?
Be calm , dear lady .
That's cowardly and womanish .
Merciful powers , keep away the nightmares that plague me when I rest !
But who are you ?
They call this "the argumentative countercheck." And so on through "the circumstantial lie" and "the direct lie." And how many times did you say his beard wasn't cut well ?
What is it , my lord ?
So take me to see them .
She's dead , deceased , she's dead .
If I had only died an hour before this event I could say I had lived a blessed life .
If you look closely at Alexander's life , Harry of Monmouth's stands up fairly well by comparison , for there are analogies in everything .
You've heard something you shouldn't have .
Cassio , do you know who might have stabbed you like this ?
If you're joining together to right these wrongs , I'll go as far as any one of you .
I will have it all mine .
On a night like this , pretty Jessica , in a bad mood , said outrageously wrong things about her lover , and he forgave her .
Read it , Mark Antony .
If only I could somehow relate them to me !
Let us prepare for our wedding. , On that day , I'll take your oath of loyalty , my Lord of Burgundy and all my peers , to guarantee my treaty .
I'm your little dog , Demetrius .
What , is he dead ?
I've stayed up all night many times before for less important matters , and I've never gotten sick .
This is the Dauphin's message .
Oh , let me remember what happened to Hastings and hurry to
Oh , I'm sick , sick !
Let's get started right away .
I'll bet my life you gave some woman the ring !
Well , let's move on to our work with the living .
I'd endure it until he came home again .
Have courage , man .
Caesar might act like that .
Oh , it was a monstrous roar , to make the earth tremble !
He spends most of his time with the good , noble Claudio .
That's the only witchcraft I ever used .
Am I sorry that I only had one child ?
It's the truth .
But I thank God that I failed in my scheme , and I rejoice in paying the penalty , as I beg God and you to pardon me .
Who are you talking to ?
What ?
I'm afraid you'll come to me again for ransom .
This is no way to treat a host who has welcomed you into his house .
Let me talk to you about your situation .
Ah , good old Kent said this would happen , that poor , banished man .
I'm begging you , take the cork out of your mouth so I can drink the news .
Come , driver !
It was me , no one else .
You know why I think so ?
And shall our lively blood , quickened by wine , be so frosty ?
Did he get away clean ?
Yes , you poor ghost , as long as I have any power of memory in this distracted head .
What a pretty picture , three fools all together .
Your misery will make them sharp and piercing like mine .
Would you like to hear some music , my sweet love ?
No , dear Queen .
You're naughty .
I will go out .
It's coming toward me .
I guess you don't want it .
Come out , you frightened man .
Our land forces have bravely stood firm .
I'm hoping my holy mood will pass .
You've stained your virtue with your own actions .
No , I don't know you , and my lady didn't send me to get you , and I'm not supposed to tell you to come speak with her , and your name is not Master Cesario , and this is not my nose , either .
But what about your guilty conscience ?
Cleopatra , our conquest won't include either the things you kept back or the ones you listed .
They'll consider you and Jessica masters of this house in place of Lord Bassanio and myself .
I've come to take you to the senate house .
Alas , my lord , your confidence is getting the better of your wisdom .
And harm is getting close !
Isn't every living thing condemning her ?
I'd risk my soul for that .
I curse her .
Keep listening .
All I ever did was tell him how hurtful and bad it was .
Good idea .
In that case it's good to be a post .
Explain , boy .
And the poor old man just wept , mixing his tears with the rain .
Make room !
It's all right , since they left their food behind , and we're hungry .
Don't come in here , uncle !
We mean well by going to this masquerade ball , but it's not smart of us to go .
In that case , I don't much care for you either .
When you ask for my blessing , I'll get down on my knees and ask you to forgive me .
Leave .
I swear , somehow the fool has been cheated out of all my money .
I'll make this wedding happen tomorrow morning .
What can you swear by now ?
When your mind is at peace , your body is sensitive to the elements .
We'll leave you here .
We can't waste time between now and six o'clock .
He is in heaven , where you will never go .
Let that be enough for you .
Pass the order along .
Go pinch your cheeks and bring some color back into your face , you cowardly boy .
The new challenge scared them about as much as sparrows frighten eagles , or rabbits frighten a lion .
If you like , Brakenbury , you can listen to anything we say .
Are you insane , old man ?
Evil spirit , I want to talk some more .
Now let Richmond and Elizabeth , the true heirs of each royal house , be joined together !
Goodbye then , Hero .
Get a little sleep .
Orlando sends his regards to you both , and he sends this bloody handkerchief to the boy he calls "his Rosalind." Is that you ?
I obey all your thoughts .
Dear son , you're alive !
Why are you doing this ?
Perhaps there's still some poison on them , to make me die with a medicinal kiss .
My father had a daughter who loved a man in the same way that I might love you , if I were a woman .
Tell me how .
You can't take anything from me that I care less about , except my life , except my life , except my life .
We've been praying for our husbands ' welfare .
I will , even if I were king of all kingdoms .
Hmm , let me see :
Where's Antony ?
That's the necklace I gave you , sir .
I'd rather see you having fun , because we have friends coming who want to have fun .
Good Enobarbus , you would be doing a very good thing if you advised your captain to speak calmly and quietly .
Who's there , aside from this foul weather ?
Inside the little rind of this weak flower , there is both poison and powerful medicine .
It wants you to go off with it , as if it wants to tell you something alone .
We three are married , but you two are defeated .
My noble king , my friends have informed me that Sir Edward Courtney and his brother , the haughty Bishop of Exeter , are now in My king , the Guildfords in My lord , the duke of Buckingham's army , Enough , you
Sir , you're old .
But how can you say that , when the king himself says you're the heir to the Danish throne ?
It's his fault that he's all worked up like this .
Goodbye , sir .
If only you were , sir .
Where are you going ?
Now let me tell you , Casca , I have already convinced some of the noblest Romans to join me in an honorable but dangerous mission .
Why , friends , you don't even know what you're doing yet .
Murder ?
Who's next ?
You can hope your father isn't your real father .
Do you maintain the same story ?
No , that's not true .
Isn't it strange ?
Okay , bring on the play .
There's no bravery in an unfair fight .
Oh , sin can disguise itself so artfully !
This will make our actions seem practical and not vengeful .
And so I said to my daughter : "Lord Hamlet is a prince , he's out of your league .
Stop hollering , man !
Who did this , Sir Andrew ?
There's going to be a storm .
You have to be patient with me .
Once I'm there , I won't need a guide anymore .
How green !
Now , Baptista , let's turn to your younger daughter .
I'll use it for fish bait .
That's true , lieutenant .
Our masquerade mates are waiting for us .
I have a That's from lack of sleep .
For you to threaten to kill me is most unlawful .
The generals want to speak with us .
You'll find out everything in due time .
Then you have to say , "I take you , Rosalind , to be my lawfully wedded wife." I take you , Rosalind , to be my lawfully wedded wife .
If she refuses my proposal , I'll tell her how much I'm looking forward to the announcement and the wedding .
I leave him to you .
For a necklace your husband had him make .
Claudio , I'm telling you right to your face that you have wronged me and my innocent child .
What news do you have ?
Angry enough to run away .
Silver .
Doors , open up for whoever is knocking !
So beware of my contempt , and keep your promise .
I think we'll have to leave out all the killing , come to think of it .
Please get him , my friend , I beg you .
Let's leave him .
And Cassio's killed ?
Yes , that's the one .
By nine o'clock .
Gonzalo is a miracle-worker .
Romeo will answer the challenge .
He has the wisdom to act bravely but also safely .
CASSIO She's awake , sir .
Do you know where I'm going ?
No , no .
If I told you I understood Greek , I'd be lying .
In the time since he left Egypt , he could have traveled an even longer distance .
Things have turned out so unluckily , sir , that we haven't had time to convince our daughter to marry you .
Where else would she be ?
Yes , yes !
Look how shapely your legs are .
I'll get free of you .
Still , it stands to reason that he mustn't betray his fear , as it might dishearten his army .
What horrible thing are you imagining ?
A king , perhaps , My lord , How is it that the prophet didn't tell me at the time that I would kill him ?
That huge black cloud over there looks like a filthy liquor jug that's about to pour out its contents .
Don't say that , Lysander .
Oh noble lord , consider your lineage .
If I were in the habit of fighting the way you are , my life insurance rates would be sky high .
Thanks , Rosencrantz and worthy Guildenstern .
Benedick and Beatrice have been waging a war of wits between themselves .
Curse you all , you're all murderers and traitors !
Be quiet , Signior Gremio .
Oh , your report is too poetic , but it sounds so true !
For various reasons that must remain secret , please do this for me .
He was crazy to run away .
Now start the music , and sing the solemn hymn .
Are you gone like that , my love , my lord ?
And this is what you told me he said : that he beat you and pretended his house wasn't his and I wasn't his wife .
The messenger arrived on my watch and is unloading his mules at your tent .
Lovers , it's time to go to bed .
Run , my lord , run .
There'd be no work .
But tell me seriously who it is .
The king is virtuous and kind .
We're trying to be reasonable while you're so upset , and we understand that you're old , and, But Goneril knows what she's doing .
You force me to read the will , then ?
Let me destroy myself , let heaven and destiny deprive me of happy hours , let day remain dark and night sleepless , and let me have nothing but terrible luck if I do not love with a pure heart , clean devotion , and holy thoughts your beautiful royal daughter .
Well , the tree bears rotten fruit .
Knock at the gate ?
That's not your fault !
In the end I left them standing in the smelly pond behind your room , with the stinking water covering them up to their chins .
Come on , put your sword away , my little soldier .
How did he say good-bye ?
Give me your hand , Roderigo .
I'll do so .
Why didn't you say "the swift steps" of time instead of the "lazy foot" ?
This news is absolutely true : Mark Antony is expected to arrive in Rome at any hour now .
What money , sir ?
Quiet , there !
The sentence I've passed down on her is firm and unshakeable .
How can you blame her , a tender young maiden still given to virgin blushes , for objecting to having a blind , naked boy appear before her ?
Please , will you take his arm ?
What is this passion that ties up my tongue ?
Is he talking nonsense ?
I hope she keeps it short .
Look how far that little candle sends its light !
When was the last time you saw her sleepwalking ?
Six or seven thousand , at most .
What do you say , James Well , I don't know what to say .
Listen !
I'll have Herod's head chopped off !
Well , she got away .
I can get the better of religion and a few flimsy vows between a misguided barbarian and a depraved Venetian girl .
Huh !
Now two things still need to be done .
The king wants to speak with Cornwall .
No doubt , for you wear too many in the first place , and it might be more seemly to make do with fewer .
I thought you were resolved to do this .
Who is this bloody man ?
Yes , that one .
There was no need to tell me to get out of there .
We heard it very clearly .
What's up , mister ?
I know it's the moon .
Have all his business ventures failed ?
Quickly , quickly , good Iras , quickly .
She will have a seat , you heard my daughter tell you how .
Does she ?
I hear him .
to wage war .
This is a lowlife who basks in the reflection of the fading glory of the woman he works for. , Get out of my sight , scoundrel !
Give me your hand , first .
Tell me , good Brutus , can you see your face ?
Maybe , but I wish I'd never laid eyes on him .
Do you know Captain Gower ?
Were you here when it started ?
Who's the one who's going out the door right now ?
What , are we playing with interjections ?
Romeo , are you crazy ?
Brutus" and "Caesar." What's so special about "Caesar" ?
But I'll write again to Mantua , and I'll keep her in my cell until Romeo comes .
There was no harm , I'm telling you .
We know what's appropriate for a watch .
It astounds me that such a weak man could beat the whole world and carry the trophy of victory alone .
It is the east , and Juliet is the sun .
Oh , in this love , you love your child so badly , that you go mad , even though she is in heaven .
Isn't that strange ?
I pick the younger one .
What , is the man insane ?
My Lord of Warwick and my brother Gloucester , follow Fluellen at a close distance .
Yet I wish I could .
Come here , sir .
When she is like this , besides walking and performing various activities , have you heard her say anything ?
But if
Who's there ?
I'll bet my life that he only wrote this letter to gauge my love for you , and for no other reason .
Hover about her and tell her she got what she deserved , with her children dead before their time .
Well , we all have our special gifts .
Very well .
It would be better to die that way than to die from being mocked , which is as bad as being killed by tickling .
Cobble you , sir .
Why , then , it's time to put on my armor and instruct the troops .
I've got nothing to do with you .
I'm just stating the facts as I see them .
And it's too bad , Brutus , that you don't have any mirrors that could display your hidden excellence to yourself .
You are welcome here , sister .
I can't even be sure these are my hands .
I Let's not break the law by starting a fight .
I don't see any Thisbe .
Kiss him for that , good widow .
I gave him the material .
Don't worry .
No , my lord .
You're a well-dressed lady .
God gives you one face , but you paint another on top of it .
For a full half hour .
Kings have trembled to kiss this hand .
Tell him , if he comes here , I'll explain everything to him and , on my word , he'll leave unharmed .
Of brave earls , Grandpre and Roussi , Fauconberg and Foix , Beaumont and Marle , Vaudemont and Lestrale .
Transform your grief into anger .
Is this your good friend who's in so much trouble ?
Are they as popular as they used to be when I lived in the city ?
Get them in here .
Peaseblossom .
Go , blockheads , go , and bring my supper to me .
O , everlasting shame !
Startle even the sky with the sound of your lances cracking .
I don't owe her any duty , it's you that I submit to .
To tell the truth , Gratiano , you're giving your wife a valid reason to get upset .
I'll do it right away .
Mistress and master , you've often asked about that lovelorn shepherd you once saw me sitting with , the one who complained about the disdainful shepherdess he was in love with .
Good morning , gentlemen .
Well , I hope you stay in that frame of mind or some poor man will end up with his face all scratched up .
The duke will drink under this tree. , He's been looking for you all day , you know .
Please , get some excellent music , because tomorrow we want to serenade Lady Hero at her bedroom window .
Not someone who doesn't share that disposition , meaning Mark Antony .
Anything .
I'll recite a prophecy before I go .
Please tell your brother what a convincing show I put on .
There's a nice reason why the constellation Pleiades has only seven stars in it .
Therefore , accept my everlasting farewell .
Shall I include hell as well ?
Romeo killed Tybalt .
Is that enough of an answer ?
Stay here at your own risk .
He is close to death , but not dead yet .
But I beg you , don't interpret my suspicions as slander against you .
Your husband , being saddled with a shrew , projects his own suffering onto my husband .
Old age always makes people act funny , even wise people , but fools more than anybody .
I do , and it sounds like you're talking in your sleep .
I want you .
Do you want to know who they are , then ?
Did you hear the news that's going around ?
Mine wasn't wearing a bridle .
Oh , this is cause for an extraordinary joy that should be engraved in gold on pillars to last forever .
Call him over here , good Monsieur Le Beau .
I never saw him like this before .
So why does it seem so particular to you ?
Who here is so barbarous that he doesn't want to be a Roman ?
What would you say to me now if I really were your precious little Rosalind ?
Richard of York , how are you doing , my loving brother ?
What do you want ?
Oh , that's nothing , believe me , sir .
Look , if you love me , stay .
Thank God" , that's a good answer .
With all my heart , I'll join you .
Can you blame him ?
Haven't I resisted even Brutus , begging from his knees ?
I could have saved her .
I would rather wrong the dead , and wrong myself and you , than wrong such honorable men .
My lord ?
Hey !
I'm ready .
Insolent Oh , the good gods !
He's flabby and out of breath. , Here , Hamlet , take my handkerchief and wipe your forehead .
No , my dear cousin .
Oh , what evil !
Yes , very bad .
I thought it was the right thing to do .
My heart's as black as death .
He would have ?
Set it down awhile .
Here's Romeo's man .
Give him the instructions for our amusing little contract , and I'll go get the money for you right away .
What's new , cousin Lodovico ?
You told me to make it well and properly and in keeping with the current style .
And you must think people are stupid if you believe they wouldn't realize all the motives you have for trying to kill me." Oh , how monstrously evil !
Well then , God forgive me !
Take it off and throw it on the ground .
She has royal blood .
I'll give you such reasons for killing him that you'll feel obliged to snuff him out .
Have you returned smiling from the great battle for the world ?
What else ?
It is , my lord .
Where do you come from ?
But try to control your speech .
Who's coming here ?
Be happy that you're alive .
What is it , my dear Bianca ?
Good night , honest Iago .
Then stay with us .
If either of you were a prince's son , and you were imprisoned as I am now , and two murderers like yourselves came to you , wouldn't you beg for your life ?
No , you have to swear it .
Now any effort ruins what it attempts .
What do you remember ?
I believe you are , Regan .
Therefore , drink up. , Servant-monster , drink a toast to me .
Two thousand ducats a year from his land !
Even though I'm mad , I won't bite him .
That fair-skinned , hard-hearted hussy , Rosaline is going to torment him until he goes insane .
That's excellent .
Tell her about my son Paris's love for her .
I know it .
I'm warning you .
Goodbye .
I stand here with the law on my side .
No , don't .
I'll go join him there , going down deeper than any anchor ever sank , and lie with him dead in the mud .
It was just removed from from the heart of , oh , she's dead !
Come here , monster , put some glue on your fingers , and carry away the rest of these clothes for us .
No , I'm as honest as I am Christian .
I am being serious , my lord .
Look in the almanac .
We beg you , for your own sake , to respect your safety and give up .
I have forgotten your name , but you were well cast in the role and played it convincingly .
There's nothing else .
Also , I've kept my sword unsheathed since I saw this , in front of the Capitol I met a lion who looked at me and strutted by without bothering to attack me .
You have a daughter named Elizabeth , who is virtuous and beautiful , aristocratic and full of grace .
Noble words , sir .
When you've finished , go back to Pompey's theater .
But , my lord , this boy was born in the forest and has been schooled not in the usual subjects but only in magic .
I think it was a year ago that I told you how much Margaret , Hero's servant woman , likes me .
The higher the Nile flows , the better the harvest .
The river in Monmouth is called Wye , but the name of the other river has gone out of my head .
She's a perfect woman , it's true .
I don't feel anything .
However , this is an extreme situation , and it's more important to control it than to worry about how you'll look .
Here's Decius Brutus .
Fulvia is dead .
Who do you think you are , keeping me out of my own house ?
With a doctor's help he might recover and become an ass again .
Let's drink through midnight .
It's nothing .
Leave me and do what I told you to do .
It must be a spirit .
The Moor himself is still at sea .
Go then , goodbye .
Give me my robe .
I wish some god could help me choose !
There's always a breath of fresh air here .
He's not sleeping to fatten up his lazy body , but praying , to nourish his attentive soul .
Are you blushing ?
Oh Clitus !
I'll fight at sea .
Gentlemen , go in there and grab him .
How dare you try to be my friend when you refuse to fight my enemy .
Don't wrong her birth .
I'll obey you until I can make bail .
All of you who are looking at her , wouldn't you swear that she's a virgin , judging by these outward shows ?
Actually , it's not so unusual when you think about it .
Octavius , I'm older than you are .
Now you're Romeo .
Now my sin has been taken from my lips by yours .
Here , I give you my blessing again .
This feather moved because of her breath .
Is all of this about your father ?
Better to have an extra servant on hand than be understaffed .
It's disgraceful !
Once she exclaimed , "Sisters , sisters , shame on you !
I hear a noise inside .
Demand .
And when he laughs , Othello will go crazy .
Yes , good fool .
What my lord said I was .
If you survive , I'll live .
Don't go out today .
My niece already thinks he's insane .
With his own lightning bolts ; I've shaken up the sturdy cliffs and uprooted pines and cedars ; I've opened up graves and awakened the corpses sleeping in them , letting them out with my powerful magic .
He's a fool and a spendthrift .
He doesn't long for the dawn as we do .
What's this !
No one's listening to you .
Do you think it's a good idea to rush ?
I will mourn Hero tonight .
And even then , in order for me to catch the fly your cousin , she must be blind ?
Yes , those are the best clothes .
My lord ?
Here comes the king , the queen , and the noblemen of court .
Just a minute ago I heard you say you didn't like it when Cassio left my wife .
You'd better knock louder .
What have you done ?
Never trust me again if I don't .
If he agrees , great .
Let's hope his sense of shame will send him back to Rome quickly .
Have you heard about Albany's and Cornwall's troops ?
Queen Margaret saw your sword steaming with his blood .
I don't know her , but I know her father and he knew mine well .
Thirty ships .
But you began so rudely .
Someone who can ride fast , go to the duke of Here , my good lord .
Speaking for myself , and no offense to the general or anyone else , I hope I'm going to heaven .
We don't want you to think we came here to offend you , except that we want to offend you with our good intentions .
Go blabber with your gossiping friends .
He who chooses me will get as much as he deserves." As much as he deserves , wait a minute there , Morocco , and consider your own value with a level head .
Look over your lines again .
Not really , unless you were ugly .
Malvolio's coming down the path .
Tell me , rainbow , do you know if either Venus , the goddess of love , or her son , Cupid , is accompanying Queen Juno ?
Take a few steps , I want to see you walk .
If it's work for a man , I'll do it .
Romans , countrymen , and friends !
So submit to my mercy or , like men who revel in their own destruction , challenge me to do my worst .
It's not a false gallop , anyway .
That's what she was expecting , and you let her down .
To prison , until you're called into court .
I certainly will , sir .
Yes , the second time around , since , as they say , old people become children again .
Ha , ha , ha !
We're ready if our minds are ready .
My lord , he will swear on his life that I haven't kept a thing. , Tell the truth , Seleucus .
You were wrong to give away your wife's first gift so thoughtlessly , a thing you swore to keep on your finger and bound faithfully to your body .
Master , I'm all tied up for you .
Yes , what time is it ?
Oh that great , funny guy , Bottom !
Now that I think about the danger of these knights , if you come to stay with me , please bring no more than twenty-five of them with you .
You're in a good mood tonight , my lord .
He who chooses me must give and risk all he has." You'd have to be more attractive for me to give or risk anything for you .
I know the real reason .
Agincourt .
All right , Friar Francis , let's keep this short .
Mountains don't tremble , however much the wind may blow !
One more thing , sir .
I don't think you're treating me fairly .
Caesar , what did my stay in Egypt have to do with you ?
Maria , take care of this poor fellow here .
Has he , sirs ?
Just look .
It's , But he's drowned , and these guys are devils .
He must be very near by now .
Hastings loved the prince's father so much that we won't be able to persuade him to do anything against the prince .
So go ahead and cry .
No , you can't do that until you take her hand and , in front of this friar , swear to marry her .
The advancement of your children , noble lady .
If he becomes pale , I know what to do .
What kind of question is that !
I've never seen such a monster .
Wind and rain can't wash it off .
Take my hand , Hastings .
I would have thought she was invincible against any assault of love .
God pardon those who are responsible for Clarence's troubles .
You teach me how I should act .
I won't bet on whether or not any of this is real .
And he's made the holiest vows to me , to back up what he says .
If you're the ones setting my daughters against me , don't let me be foolish enough to take it lying down .
Hello !
Why are you so far from home ?
I didn't love you .
Tell me , so I can cut it out of myself .
My uncle Clarence's angry ghost .
Give me those flowers .
So , may the gods protect you and change the hearts of the Romans so that they turn and give you their support .
Dear friends , let's go to bed .
I just meant that you should use some holy thistle .
Damn it , this isn't funny .
Oh , he's really gone .
Please , just look over there .
Have you forgotten the torture I freed you from ?
If even then they don't answer to your satisfaction , you can say that they're not the men you thought they were .
Until the day we die , my lord .
Let it be who it is .
Where did you leave him ?
We achieve things with our intelligence , not by magic , and intelligent planning takes time .
I can assure you that no enemy will ever take the noble Brutus alive .
Oh !
Well , that's the same thing .
The same liquor that quenched their thirst has fired me up .
The man hasn't done anything wrong .
What did he say ?
With Rosaline , father ?
Next he slung his arm around the bride's neck and kissed her with such a smack that when they parted the sound of their lips made the whole church echo .
For you to do it would be good service .
But here comes Antony .
How are you , soldier ?
Goneril , are you coming with us ?
What will be my evidence ?
The king is getting up .
Lovell , go as fast as you can to Doctor Shaw .
Take these too .
Those who rush stumble and fall .
The smell of leek turns my stomach .
You could just as easily say that a king sleeps near a beggar if the beggar lives near him , or that the church is supported by your drum because it "stands by" your drum .
No , come on , one more time .
I'd rather go without the money .
But , hey , this doesn't mean you're looking to get married , does it ?
The king rode out alone to view their troops .
Your superiors .
My heart , which dried out with grief , will surely break apart into a powder , and that will be the end of my disgusting mind .
Flies are healthier and more honorable and better suited for romance than Romeo .
Too quickly , we boarded a ship .
I saw her face as she walked with her brother and Mark Antony .
Fine , but not enough .
Terrible .
He can sniff his way to Dover .
Look how she leans her hand on her cheek .
Whose house ?
It's a messenger from the warships .
I assure you , sir , it's true .
May you die of the worst disease !
Check on your daughter , your house , your money !
Who among us stabbed him for any cause but justice ?
Ma'am , my master's coming .
Yet Brutus says he was ambitious , and Brutus is an honorable man .
I'll have to ask you some questions , madam .
Did you have to give them everything ?
A bit of a hurry , my lord !
Yes , I really think so .
Don't insult me with your distrust .
It's a measly little cap , a dessert crust , a plaything , a silk pie .
I find you quite gentle .
Climb up to her bedroom and comfort her .
He meant he did nothing right for me , which is true , unfortunately .
He looks humbler than he used to .
Silvius , keep your promise to marry Phoebe if she refuses me .
Cicero , I've seen storms in which the angry winds split old oak trees , and I've seen the ocean swell , rage , and foam , as if it wanted to reach the storm clouds , but never before tonight , never until now , have I experienced a storm that drops fire .
Did you see him enter this abbey ?
I swear , I'm telling you what I honestly think .
He's hot-tempered , and he might try to hit you with his staff .
Your honor is the reason you are leaving .
May the gods destroy you !
Here he comes .
I want to learn how to lie .
Who talks of my nation ?
Her reputation is also her own .
Please , just walk with me a little ways , and tell me if I'll see you later tonight .
You're in love ?
Good .
What can I do for your highness ?
Stop , if you can't be kind , at least have some shame .
Neither good nor bad .
You wrong me , Brutus .
Listen to me , for I have something to tell you .
Yes , and Wall too .
How about it , Corporal Nym ?
Tell me where you've stowed away my money , or I swear I'll break that comical head of yours for goofing when I'm not in the mood .
His words are like poison to me .
It's so scary to look down !
Stay near me so I'll remember .
Signior Tranio , you also took aim at that bird , though you didn't hit her. , So here's a health to all who've shot and missed .
Regan gives good advice .
O noble English , who could take on the entire French army with only half their forces , leaving the other half to stand by , idle and laughing .
My Lord of Cambridge and my good Lord of Masham and you , my noble knight , what do you think ?
I could do it myself .
The sight of them is offensive .
We spend more time seeking out the fleeting glories of this temporary world than looking to the permanent grace of God !
But listen to me , signor ,
Or is he walking ?
Yes , sir .
Go tell the hunters to blow their horns and wake them up .
I know he holds me dear , but I haven't asked him about the coronation , and he hasn't told me .
Who , me ?
My husband is alive on earth , my vows of marriage are in heaven .
Now go to the door and stay there until I call for you .
Upon the king !
These are tricks of the imagination , and this place is filled with magicians .
I hear that Edgar , Gloucester's exiled son , is with the Earl of Kent in Germany .
My eyes itch , is that an omen I'll be crying soon ?
He's having a fit and talking nonsense .
It's difficult to have such immaturity so close to my heart , but bear with me .
Sir , you need a drink .
If you say one more word , I'll punish you , maybe even hate you .
Tell me , friend .
Cassio's a handsome man .
Who's there ?
The wind's whipping up the waves so high you expect them to reach the clouds and splash against the stars in the sky .
But don't delay .
On me , though I am barely half the man that Edward was ?
Goodbye !
Come on , relax , dear .
If I'm not mistaken , that's Portia's voice .
Okay .
No , he's a devil , a devil , I tell you !
So , the man would talk half as much as Benedick and be half as serious as Don John , And if he were handsome , agile , and rich , too , he could have any woman in the world , all he'd need was her good will .
Of all places , I don't like the
I admit the cape .
Tell us when you wish to get married , and may God give you joy .
Is it gone ?
All three of them are crazy with despair .
You , niece .
Oh no !
What do you think I should do ?
You don't know a thing !
My gracious king .
The world doesn't make laws to make you rich .
Where's this so-called king ?
Yes , boy .
I'm just saying that if you're good and beautiful , your goodness should have nothing to do with your beauty .
No .
Excuse me , sir , do you know how to read ?
Speak once again .
I thank you , lady .
Dinner is over , and we're going to get there too late .
What's that ?
To hell with your sword .
I tell you , this will make her angry when she hears about it .
If I could get my hands on you , I'd make you care .
My God , it's the same one I gave the judge !
My Will you come on , cousin ?
Ah , where's my servant ? , Give me some brandy. , These griefs , these pains , these sorrows make me old .
I'm not coming .
You wouldn't tell a sick man he "seriously" has to make his will , it would just make him worse .
Let's talk .
Look , he's approaching Caesar .
It's much better to be destroyed by a noble enemy than by a cruel and heartless one .
Uncle !
You'll find I'll give it to you very willingly .
Sir , be a man .
And there's no need for wonder or worry .
What do you mean , my lord ?
Well , we'll speak more soon .
Now , soldiers , advance .
I'll go to the Antipodes for any little errand you can think of .
I'll speak to him now .
What's going on ?
person when you're ready , if you're inclined .
Away with the doddering fool !
I sent the French queen with him too , for the same reason .
Get out of here , you horrible ghost , you hallucination .
Maybe you should ask , what will you do for a husband ?
Just looking at you makes me sick .
If not , goodbye .
What good does heaven have in store that can do me any good now ?
Do as I say .
I hope you both get drenched with a dew as evil as what my mother used to collect with a crow's feather from the poison swamps .
Bottom !
I can't go any further , sir .
Tell him that when our noble father , the duke of York , gave his three sons his blessing , he never imagined that our friendship would come to this .
These are nothing but jealous lies .
If it isn't my old friend Grumio , and my dear friend Petruchio !
No money , I swear .
Did you hear this , Gonzalo ?
If I took the kingdom from your sons , I'll give it to your daughter to make up for it .
Our fate depends on this chance .
He's dead .
If we were in front of our armies , about to fight , I would do this .
Hey , what's this , Adam ?
He's furious because she stole an adorable boy from an Indian king .
Right now you swear to me that you are a virgin ; if you were a poet , I might have some hope you were lying .
Peter , wait for me at the gate .
Yes , that's the one .
What do you think of marching to Philippi immediately ?
You brazen whore !
But his kindness was nobler than even his desire for revenge , his natural goodness was stronger than his need to give his brother what he deserved .
Can you imagine cement and stone talking better ?
It carried us toward Corinth-or so we thought .
Please be quiet .
A nice coincidence , my lord .
Oh , poor shepherd !
Beat ,
Do you know any , count ?
Ingratitude is always hideous , but an ungrateful child is uglier than a sea monster !
The biggest clue is his seriousness .
You think I'm a sponge , my lord ?
Let's go back to our bedroom .
He's having dinner tonight with a prostitute , and I'll go visit him .
Go there and compare her objectively to some other girls I'll show you .
It's time for me to go .
Have a good morning .
Go as fast as you can .
Come on , come on .
That's why you sleep so soundly .
Your slander has broken her heart , and now she lies buried with her ancestors in a tomb , ancestors who had never been tainted by scandal until you caused one with your wickedness .
Dear lady , welcome home .
What do you mean , "in a strange way" ?
Here , madam .
Richard .
You shouldn't talk about him like that !
The royal tree has left us other fruit , which , with time , will do just fine on the throne and make us all happy as king , I'm sure .
You have to be patient , madam .
I haven't eaten today .
He's still sleeping , ma'am .
Let me tell you , friends ,
A crown was offered to him , and he pushed it away with the back of his hand , like this , and then the people started shouting .
If , then , that friend demands to know why I rose up against Caesar , this is my answer : it's not that I loved Caesar less , but that I loved Rome more .
It's time to put our armor on .
Indeed , I should have asked you before who he was .
Here's the story we'll tell her : that I was with you at your shop , watching you make her necklace , and that you're going to deliver it tomorrow .
Therefore my sadness is without limit .
Do you really speak like such a gentleman ?
No , not for all of Venice .
I don't know what I'm doing .
You think I'm kidding .
What is logical , then , my lord ?
I'll die like a swan .
His love is blind , so it belongs in the dark .
Hurry , send someone immediately !
But it's enough to know that the day will end , and then the end will be known .
Goodbye .
If only my prayers could inspire that kind of affection !
No , monster , not me .
An awful monster !
Yes , and these .
And what's your connection with the traitors who landed in our kingdom recently ?
His arrival fits perfectly into my plan .
Let's have him land and solemnly proceed to London .
Will my daughter be a good musician , do you think ?
I need better evidence than the ghost to work with .
Up .
You'll pay for this if I ever see you face-to-face in the daylight .
Like medicine for a sick man .
Who wishes that ?
It's very hot .
Please let me go .
It's a good thing he's here to recommend himself .
Or thorn-bushes .
You're my true and honorable wife , as dear to me as the blood that runs through my sad heart .
Sure , I hate her , but I wouldn't hurt her .
How can I describe you that will make you appeal to the young woman and will also agree with God , the law , my honor , and her feelings ?
He only lived long enough to become a man , and as soon as he proved that he was a man by fighting like one , he died .
Yes , now I'm in Arden , and that makes me the bigger fool .
Can't you talk ?
But he's got to build churches for that to happen , my lady , or else he'll have to put up with being forgotten , like the hobby-horse in the popular song that goes , "Heigh-ho , heigh-ho , the hobby-horse is forgotten." What does this mean , my lord ?
Who are you talking about , niece ?
You're a fool .
And why , wise lady ?
If you're happy with what you've won And accept this prize as your blissful destiny , Then turn to where your lady is , And claim her with a loving kiss."
May God keep you well , sir .
Are you in your right mind ?
No , uncle , I won't be married .
To show you that that's me , let me prove it a little even in this case .
I have nothing to do with what you're talking about , my lord .
Where's your master , Dromio ?
It's nearly dinner time , and the night's going to be wasted .
Wasn't Don John at dinner tonight ?
For someone as intelligent as you the situation must be clear enough .
Did you have no poison , no sharp knife , no weapon you could use to kill me quickly , nothing so disgraceful , except banishment ?
They are crying and moaning over Tybalt's corpse .
Do you know the way to Dover ?
My God , this is unbelievably strange .
All I know is that staying up late is staying up late .
Father , this isn't easy for me .
wise and graceful as the earth is wonderful and divine .
Stay here for a moment .
Yes , I swear .
Tranio , I think I've got it !
Where is our entertainment director ?
Hell and damnation !
And how did you get in here ?
Let him be for a bit .
Looking toward England , we reminisced about the countless frightening experiences we'd had in the wars between the Yorks and the Lancasters .
Treat me like you would treat a dog , kick me , hit me , neglect me , try to lose me .
Now he's telling the story .
Now , my dear friend , what lucky wind blows you in from Verona ?
Quiet , quiet , Iras .
The level meadow , where the freckled cowslip , burnet , and green clover once grew , has become useless : unmowed , it grows to seed , so that nothing springs up but weeds , rough thistles , barren plants , and burs .
No , please .
So he's dead ?
Go , and hurry back to bring us her reply and news of her state of mind .
Cupid is a bad boy for making poor women go crazy like this .
I'm not holding your hand , sir .
Three thousand ducats , hmmm .
You've bet on the weaker fencer .
Enough , Captain .
Master , is this Satan's mistress ?
What have you two sisters done ?
Would your highness like to take a walk ?
I think that on a night like this , when the wind blew the trees so gently that they didn't make a sound , On a night like this , On a night like this , On a night like this ,
Change into better clothes .
You can't mean what you're saying .
No , I swear I'm not .
So we are in agreement .
You're tigers , not daughters .
My God , it's morning .
But my eyes , which I've darted at you , haven't even left a mark .
Not one , my lord .
I ate with him and my sister .
It's good you hunted for yourself , sir .
Carry me , good friends , to where Cleopatra is .
He's called Modo and Mahu .
Who here is so low that he wants to be a slave ?
I can't believe you're my son .
But I reversed the death sentence .
I agree , Put a mark next to his name too , Antony .
Love will give me strength , and strength will help me accomplish this plan .
I wish there wasn't so much dew on the ground .
His faults were equally matched by his virtues .
How are you feeling now ?
He and Lepidus are at Caesar's house .
I'd like to think all men have some hope .
I hope you sleep peacefully .
So , please , my lord , don't assume that I'm treacherous just because I'm poor , with no titles to my name .
Farewell .
Farewell !
All right , we'll have a prologue then .
I did , sir , but it didn't answer me .
I'd second your wish if it automatically meant that Lucentio could have Baptista's youngest daughter .
Make sure everyone knows that .
But you won't take his flesh if he can't pay .
I don't think he'd have any choice , my lord .
He's written you a letter .
I'll tell you privately .
She is not , madam .
Yes , probably , because I'm staying for lunch .
Unless my horse goes faster than expected , I will be back an hour or two after sunset .
Brother , I'll go and bring it to you .
Good idea .
That too .
If we happen to offend you , it's because we want to .
If you leave like that , you tell the world that it's not worthy of a good-bye .
Come here !
I'm full of joy .
Come , why be so hesitant ?
I'll do anything you ask .
Me , ma'am ?
Is everything ready for that event ?
Quiet !
Listen to him speaking in quarter notes !
Is that true ?
Oh , your contemptible lady !
Look at you , thrashing about like a blind man .
Madam , with all my heart .
Amen .
The Lord keep him from the title of king !
Shall I tell Caesar what you request from him ?
You'll wear a mask , and you can make your voice as high as you want to .
Either let heaven send lightning to strike the murderer dead or let the earth open wide and devour him , as it does this good king's blood .
That was me , but it's not me , I'm not ashamed to tell you what I once was , since I'm so happy to have since converted .
Is there any natural cause for hardening of the heart ?
Come on , shovel .
I've locked it up in my room .
May I speak , Caesar .
But if I really laid him bare , I'd have to weep and hang my head , and you would not believe me , his behavior is so shocking .
You're not going , sir .
I can not blame you now for weeping .
Do not , Phoebe .
I'd swear he wouldn't leave it behind , or even take it off his finger , for all the money in the world .
You're asking me !
Good night to you .
Bring the fancy clothes out of my house , to use as bait to catch these thieves .
Likewise , our common men lie drenched in the blood of princes , and their wounded steeds , ankle-deep in gore , struggle and , raging wildly , stamp on their dead masters with their hooves , killing them a second time .
Good point , Decius .
Oh , don't ask me why I "need" them !
Oh , don't fight by sea , noble Emperor !
It's very strange .
Yeah , and he's going to tame her .
Shake my hand .
Out of the frying pan and into the fire , from a tyrant duke to a tyrant brother !
We'll cool the mixture with baboon blood .
I'll help out , if only because he speaks the same language as me .
I've been up all night .
Yes , and one other place , if you'll only let me name it .
Your eyes are playing tricks on you .
God help me !
They lie in bed while they dream about the truth .
God bless you .
Why shouldn't she take my hand , father ?
Time ambles for both men .
Oh , come on .
Yes , he was born at Monmouth , Captain Gower .
I'll ask only Benedick to come with me , for from the top of his head to the soles of his feet he's a joker .
Your head , my lord ?
Should we go inside ?
Oh , so you'd give me all your tediousness ?
It did , it did .
Come here , good Volumnius .
I'm off to visit my friends in Padua , particularly my best friend Hortensio .
And where's Cordelia ? , Do you see this , Kent ?
Oh , dear .
Look , she's come home from confession with a happy look on her face .
You will .
God alive !
There's a man haunting this forest who abuses the trees by carving "Rosalind" on their barks .
Remember who liked your yellow stockings , " Your yellow stockings ?
He was like a schoolboy who finds a bird's nest and happily shows it to his friend , who then steals it from him .
You ought to be ashamed of yourself !
It is that .
I can't blame you , old lord .
Call him .
As
Even if it's not better , your first marriage is over .
But never mind them , if Caesar had stabbed their mothers , they would've forgiven him .
Then he shook Bassanio's hand affectionately , and they separated .
I demand to be satisfied .
Leave me for a bit .
But before they reached us-let me say no more !
Father is on the lookout .
I'll tell my husband what you've said , Launcelot .
He may recover yet .
There isn't any other way , unless you took on another form and became someone else .
What's that , my lord ?
He used to lend money as a favor between Christians ; but now , let him think about his own debt .
Now , you lie there on the path .
So , goodbye .
I won't be taken for a fool who sighs and gives in to Christian meddlers .
I'll cure you of your insolence , and I'm not going to give you a thousand crowns , either ! , Hey , Dennis !
I'm amazed you're still talking , Signior Benedick .
Oh , come on. , Come here , sir .
I chose her for my wife when I thought I had no father to ask advice of .
Well , explain , but do it fast so that your puny store of kindness isn't used up by talking about it .
Come with me ; I'll spy under the tents to see if any of my own people plan to desert me .
You're lying , you shaggy-haired villain !
By my sword , Beatrice , you love me .
I beg you , daughter , don't make me crazy .
And like I am for no woman .
I could go on weeping like a woman and bragging about how I will avenge them !
Hail to you , thane of Glamis !
We haven't been able to meet on a hill or in a valley , in the forest or a meadow , by a pebbly fountain or a rushing stream , or on the beach by the ocean without you disturbing us .
You don't have more than half an hour to live .
Tell me what you are .
If only his lord were more like him .
You can't find that out , even if you held my heart in your hand you couldn't make me tell you .
I feel tortured by all this talking .
Signor Brabantio , hey !
I'm really a pitiful singer .
And on their graves , I trust , the story of this day's work will be written in brass .
Take me off to jail ?
Should we do that ?
Now , Death , you can boast that you have an incomparable girl in your possession .
Can't you see I'm eating ?
Do you have unusual snakes there ?
I'm not sick if you've prepared some honorable exploit for me .
An enemy to tyrants and a friend to my country .
Caesar is in a sober mood .
Why , isn't all this joking better than groaning about love ?
He's pretty awful in the morning when he's sobering up , and even worse in the afternoon when he's drunk .
You mean the man who used to be Othello ?
You have to come with me .
Someone who was always near you .
Nature would produce its harvests in abundance , to feed my innocent people .
I'll just speak a word or two here in the house and then I'll go with you .
Now she's gone forever. , Cordelia , Cordelia , stay a while .
Fool !
I'm still young enough to see without glasses , and I don't see what you're talking about .
Now I'm starting to pity Titania for being so infatuated .
I didn't call you .
Let me shake your hand .
That's completely beside the point .
Wasn't he here ?
Some dungeon .
And how , out of your great heap of knowledge , will you manage to prove that ?
A man's virtues will always show themselves , and that's the end of that .
But let's shake hands , Menas .
Let's embrace
Definitely not .
Really , I'm only pretending to be him .
What an irreplaceable and grievous loss !
Beat him up .
If anyone doubts this , let him put me on trial .
I hope God makes you happy again , like you once were .
Leave you alone !
You'll see .
She's dead , like a beautiful flower , killed by an unseasonable frost .
That's not in her favor .
I'll teach you a lesson .
What's your name ?
Shame on Romeo !
Are you sad about that ?
I don't even know you .
Smile , then , on this beautiful union .
Farewell .
Will you kill him then ?
It must be .
Your highness , could you send me on a mission to the ends of the earth ?
I don't deny it .
Did you hear that ?
The king ?
You know what they say .
One of them is too much like a painting of a man , he never speaks , and the other is too much like a spoiled little boy , always chattering .
I will do this deed before I lose my sense of purpose .
I don't have any "brilliant" reason for it , but I have a good enough reason .
I swear , I love you .
Now the only person I love , and believe in , and want to look at , is Helena .
I don't want to go mad .
I'm already here , sir .
But since your father doesn't want him to marry you , you have to consider Demetrius to be the better man .
Be convincing .
So you couldn't see his face , then ?
God bless you for doing this .
It might as well be the same with Caesar .
Her father loves you , Demetrius .
No more , please .
I don't until you practice them on me .
Oh , pardon me for bringing this bad news , but you told me it was my job , sir .
Look , your wife is with him .
You should know that when I came here I was prepared to accept your offer .
If you could please stop fooling around , I'll tell you what your mother wants .
He's coming , madam ; but he's acting very strangely .
Iago , I'm leaving my dear Desdemona with you .
Even if these men have escaped the law and punishment at home , they can not escape God .
We'll go visit Caliban , my slave who always talks to us so nastily .
Don't .
Doesn't a Jew have hands , bodily organs , a human shape , five senses , feelings , and passions ?
Who wants to buy the flock and the pasture ?
You're right , Lysander's admirable too .
Put your sword away .
All cooped up together , just as you ordered , all imprisoned in the grove of linden trees that protects your room from bad weather .
I could find it in my heart to beat him , Come on , kiss my feet .
Has anyone seen Cesario ?
Then I'll smack you on the head with the serving-creature's knife .
My new master is expecting your approach .
Damn you !
No , most likely .
Oh , brother Montague , give me your hand .
If this dream vision is typical of what this island conjures up , then I'll lose my son twice .
Really , my lord , why are you so excessively sad ?
You're standing .
No .
I asked a servant .
From this moment on , I'll never say another word .
And by all means see if you can get the young man to answer it .
This sunken-eyed hag was brought here pregnant and left by the sailors .
But first , I'll dump this fellow in his grave , then return to my love weeping with grief .
These outbursts of yours don't even look like real fear .
I ran into her recently at the edge of the forest , looking for sweet presents for this hateful idiot , and I scolded her and argued with her .
No .
I'm very sick , too .
And you're my husband , right ?
You go pale , you stare , and you act in awe of the strange disturbance in the heavens .
And is "pig" not the same as "great , " may I ask ?
Why did you send me out , brave Cassius ?
But where did this happen ?
Yes , I am .
Give us answers .
How are you doing , Stephano ?
Swear by my sword you'll never mention what you've heard .
No trouble , sir .
Nobody I care about more than myself .
God doesn't need to use indirect or illegal means to kill those who have offended him .
Why , so did you .
Don't put me in the stocks .
Take me to the man my husband is in debt to .
Bring his will here , and we'll figure out a way to reduce his bequests to the people .
So , tell people that you're from Epidamnum-otherwise all your goods will be confiscated .
Madam , I heard her speak .
Stop Harry of England , who is now sweeping through our land with banners drenched in the French blood he spilled at Harfleur .
I'm old and foolish .
Anything that's mended is only patched up .
What didn't you like ?
Are you going to watch the race ?
Yes , they're spirits that I've called out of their prisons to perform my whims .
Romeo , Romeo , Romeo !
But how would you praise a truly good woman , someone who had no reason to worry about what anyone said about her ?
Why are you defying me in this urgent matter ?
The old guy .
So I'll have nothing to do with that gaudy gold box , it's like the gold that Midas couldn't eat .
What I think about this , and about what's happening here in Rome , I'll tell you later .
Their hands and faces were all covered with blood .
These cowards manage to make fools of brave men .
Call out my household servants .
This is what Calphurnia's dream means .
How can we tell which of us is the oldest ?
Why is the Jew waiting ?
I'll commute your death sentence .
Curse the day !
Do you know them ?
To the breach , to the breach !
I made my father angry , so I went to Friar Lawrence's cell to confess and be forgiven .
The queen and her elves will be here soon .
Follow me , then .
You're supposed to show that you understand that Pyramus just went to check on a noise he heard and is coming right back .
He'll be a good governor .

Not yet , cousin .
Oh , she's so witty and creative !
Twenty thousand crowns now , and half my lands after my death .
But how wonderful that she should be so fond of Signior Benedick , whom she has always appeared to hate .
You go and take care of your business ( since everybody has some business to take care of , whatever it is worth ) , and I'll go and pray .
Against my will , I've been told to bring you in to dinner." There's a double meaning in that .
Don't you suspect my office ?
The sun glints off our armor .
If we have sweet-smelling breath , I'm sure they'll say "it's a sweet play." Now no more talking .
I thought everything out here was wild , which is why I acted so stern and commanding .
I swear by the mass , before I close my eyes to go to sleep , I'll put in some good fighting , or I'll lie in the ground dead .
Then your other senses must be getting worse because of the trauma of blindness .
But it's dark out , and it could be a trap .
Was that my father who left here in such a hurry ?
Oh , most bloody sight !
Lysander , keep your Hermia .
Why ?
Will it eat me ?
Well , if you don't , then I'm out of here .
You kick me out , he kicks me back .
There's no one else here .
Quiet !
I order you to come with me .
Welcome to Cyprus .
The king has heard them , but as yet has made no answer .
She gave it to him , and he gave it to his whore .
Everyone's there except Metellus Cimber , and he's gone to look for you at your house .
I could challenge him to a duel and then not show up .
Sit down for a while , and we'll tell you again the story you don't want to believe , about what we've seen two nights now .
He insisted on leaving this ring with me whether I wanted it or not .
Are you serious ?
If you are a devil , I won't be able to kill you .
I'm going to cry .
The forests , the skies , the mountains , everything around us seemed to echo the barks of the hounds .
You give your best praise to the worst women .
Go away !
If you forgive my mistake , I swear I'll never break an oath with you again .
They
She can't deny it .
Is that you , Iago ?
Hero thinks Beatrice will surely die , for she says she'll die if he doesn't love her , and that she'll die before she tells him , and she'll die if he woos her and she's made to hold back even one of her usual insults .
No , sir .
So you had time as you were dying to look around ?
His name !
The young snake that escaped will in time become poisonous and threatening , but for now he has no fangs .
Why , how could she have been murdered ?
My lord , he just left here .
Good for you , holding out on me like this !
My noble brother !
The weather is fair .
That's my brave lord !
Darkness is stumbling out of the sun's path like a drunk man .
Would he have snuck away from me while I was asleep ?
Why shouldn't I ?
Gallus , you go with him .
You're wrong to kill me for loving you .
I'm sorry to hear this .
That's one of them .
Has he come home yet ?
It has caused the downfall of many kings .
You've never thought of me like that , and you have no reason to .
My master is standing out in the street !
As dumb as dirt !
Will you take me , my lady ?
How could I honorably give him what I've already given you ?
If I can't have an estate by birthright , then I'll get it by being clever .
You can take your chances after dinner .
Peter , did you ever see anything like it ?
So the pale , angry moon , who controls the tides , fills the air with diseases .
The English are in the field , French lords .
What are you saying , mistress ?
So shut up !
What part of her body is Ireland ?
I love my master , and he'll find me very hard-working .
Go ahead , use your authority .
Go take them back and smear the sleeping guards with the blood .
We already knew that .
What victory does he bring home ?
Are your doors locked ?
What's going on , Rosalind ?
Hold off burying her until I've caught her in my arms once more .
A crazy bastard .
Let's not get gloomy in our reminiscing , since there's no reason for sadness anymore .
He's here , sir , but please don't bother him .
I will confess it to all the world .
Where did she die ?
I can tell that you don't know who I am .
Start a fight ?
Let me shake your hand .
Why only a few courtiers , my lord of Buckingham ?
I don't know what private grudges they had that made them do it .
They did want me to tell her , but I persuaded them that , if they truly loved Benedick , they would try to get him to battle his emotions and keep Beatrice in the dark .
Oh , oh , oh !
Take me inside some house , Benvolio , or I'll pass out .
Because she's been chosen by Signior Hortensio .
Cobweb .
Here .
What , is he scared of a gun that only fired a blank ?
He wants to be crowned .
Yes , I do .
You come here with letters against the king , and you take his conceited daughter's side against his royal highness .
Goodbye , gentlemen .
Then let God grant me that you'll be damned for that wicked deed .
He's getting worse and worse .
I can't love him .
Oh , Antony , Antony , Antony !
I'm doing so .
Can he even get angry ?
But come , lords , will you come with me to Edward's room to comfort him ?
I dreamed last night that I feasted with Caesar , and unlucky signs overwhelmed my imagination .
What's wrong with you ?
What a crazy island this is .
And when she was here recently she flirted with Edmund and gave him significant glances .
Let's sit here on the church bench until two and then go off to bed .
Hello , brother Edmund .
I'll meet you at your tent .
You just said they had to face her .
I won't refuse you anything .
The whole town will riot !
The army is ready .
What do you think you're doing ?
They sit chatting by the parlor fire .
Good duke , come receive your daughter .
You're so neat and well put-together that you look like you love yourself more than anyone else .
He's not your man .
Anyone who refuses to drink to my niece until his brain spins around like a merry-go-round is scum .
Yes , your Majesty .
Yes , please tell me .
Will you wait awhile ?
Father , take pity on him .
No , it's true , or if it's not , I'm a villain .
Give me your torch , boy .
It's torture , not mercy .
And yet I think you look with your eyes just like every other woman does .
He's not standing straight enough to hold a flag .
I wish your loyalty were as foolish .
Come on !
Oh , sun , I will never see another one of your sunrises .
Adieu .
Like the Oh stop it , you lusty bed-hopper .
As sane as me ?
I mean well , sir .
Please , just wait a minute .
Listen !
Do you honestly think , tell me , Emilia , there are women who'd cheat on their husbands in such a disgusting manner ?
Come talk to me tomorrow as early as you can. , Come with me , my dear love .
He might have treated me like that , because I'm as unused to abuse as a little child .
If you can't do it , be grateful you've lived this long and go wait to die in your cabin , if it comes to that. , Harder , men ! , Now get out of our way , I'm telling you .
Me neither , my lord .
Nice to see you .
It's the devil speaking through him .
God be with you .
That villain , Romeo .
You're so infatuated with him that you're hallucinating .
I'll get it done right away .
Or maybe , to make it even more lovely , I'll sing it when the heroine dies .
He got what he deserved .
That's true , my good boy. , Come on , take us to that hut .
I'd give half my dowry to keep anything bad from happening to him .
Damn it !
Go ahead and say you don't love me , but not so bitterly .
Her worth is carried on the wind And it blows throughout the world , carrying the name of Rosalind .
No , who are you talking about ?
Oh , I hate looking at his face now !
I'd rather be hung in chains from one of our pyramids !
I really believe your cousin was falsely accused .
Come .
But when You take up your duties too cheerfully .
Yes , just as great and just as recent .
I wish there was less social pressure to drink .
Yes , Caesar , but it's not gone yet .
I wish she were in heaven so she could appeal to some power to make this dog Jew change his mind .
Or you can pretend to settle your differences until this matter with Pompey is finished .
Here's my hand .
You go to Friar Lawrence's cell .
And buried , noble Tyrrel ?
Look !
Cassio !
What , you look amused .
No , the legs and thighs .
My fortune , like that of many of us tonight , is to go drunk to bed .
It was worse than being a captive in chains .
Even if we fail at that , we can still fight him on land .
You seem like a good judge .
You'll be back at two o'clock ?
What's the bet ?
Good Mr. Mustardseed , I know you very well .
Canidius and the others that left Antony are given hospitality here but no positions of trust .
We have to think about that .
Put a lot of cash together .
By my father's death , Your life has dishonored his death .
The games are done and Caesar is returning .
There she is .
Quiet there !
Why are you talking about robbery ?
I never heard so loud a voice issue from such an empty heart .
No , by no means .
By the door .
Will it be chased away by bowing and scraping ?
But really , are you the one who's been hanging on the trees those poems that speak so admiringly of Rosalind ?
All ladies love me , except you .
Good luck , sir .
Nell .
Help !
Let's go .
Oh cousin , cousin , cousin , my sweet little cousin , I wish you knew how deep in love I am .
This was the basket .
Go to hell , you whore !
Who's the ruler here ?
Now be quiet .
I've told you everything I know .
Horatio says we're imagining it , and won't let himself believe anything about this horrible thing that we've seen twice now .
Good morning , sir .
Even What , were you all snarling before I arrived , ready to catch each other by the throat like dogs , but now that I'm here , you turn your hatred toward me ?
The rules of dueling say he has to .
My daughter married death .
man's cheeks .
Well , that's what he's doing , making you free to enjoy heaven .
Men can be masters of their fate .
Kill me tomorrow , but let me live tonight .
Where is he ?
And I know that unless the law intervenes , it'll be bad news for poor Antonio .
It's a horrible thing to die when you're not prepared for it , my gracious lord .
Today shall always be remembered as a holy day .
You're in a hurry , are you ?
Oh , where have you led me , Egypt ?
But I beg your pardon .
Do you like me , Kate ?
I wasn't talking to any man at that time , my lord .
I'd write sad songs about unrequited love and sing them loudly in the middle of the night .
But as of right this second all these things are yours .
Has it come to this ?
Good Captain Blunt , tell the earl goodnight from me , and tell him that by two in the morning I would like him to visit my tent .
When they feared death , they escaped with their lives ; and now where they imagine they're safe , they perish .
Why do you complain about your birth , the heavens , and the earth ?
I thought he was just toying with you and meant to ruin your reputation .
Will you marry her ?
Let me have it now .
Can't do it .
But his ambition , for that , I killed him .
But a dream itself is just a shadow .
Oh , Antony !
Just come again tomorrow .
Please , let's not talk about it .
And to me , Denmark is a prison .
Forever and forever , farewell , Cassius !
That's a Cornish name .
Who pronounced this death sentence before a court of law could even convict me ?
My father's spirit is growing in me , and I won't take this any longer .
There will be a feast from five o'clock until eleven .
God bless your Worship !
But please , tell him how well I faked a faint .
But stay calm , and don't get carried away by rage , or I'll think you're not a man .
My Queen and Eros have by their brave examples beaten me to the history books .
We won't take their garbage .
Speak .
They'll assume that Cicero , with his sound judgment , ordered the actions .
They want to whip me for telling the truth , you want to whip me for lying , and sometimes I'm even whipped for keeping quiet .
His feelings don't move in that direction .
If our eyes were policemen , they might capture two thieves at once while we're embracing .
If the future turns out as I hope it will , I'm all set for success .
Oh , Mother Nature , why did you create lions ?
So I guess it's you , you silver treasure house .
Did he lose his other eye ?
What's the news ?
This messenger is wise .
I'll wait patiently .
No offense taken .
And that's what you want me to do !
Why has all this been put on the table ?
With my eye sockets ?
Damn those words , "but yet ! " "But yet" is like a jailer about to bring out some horrible criminal .
Don't swear by the future , because you've ruined it before it has even arrived .
Who's coming with her ?
Oh , I was such a beast to be angry at him .
Send for the Count .
Why are you leading these men through the streets ?
It would've been better for you not to have been born at all than to displease me as you did .
No , my good lord .
Nature took Helen's Cleopatra's majesty , The best of Atalanta , And unhappy Lucretia's modesty .
I don't want to hear you sing .
Tybalt was my nephew !
Losers always leave quickly .
Come , let's have one more extravagant night .
In your own kitchens you act like wildcats .
I feel my stomach squeezing up against my heart .
If love has touched you , love has touched you , end of story .
He has both my power and my influence over Octavia .
I'm losing this duel of wits .
If our father continues to use his authority as usual , then his recent abdication of the kingdom will just hurt us .
Thank you , sir .
No , I'll help too .
I can see in your eyes that you're starving .
Let's hear it .
Pardon my crime , sovereign , but not my person .
Thank you , Tubal .
Then let Octavia dig up your face with her nails .
Yes .
The only possible interest I could take in you would be to hit you on the head with a stool , paint your face with blood , and make a fool out of you .
Despised , distressed , hated , martyred , killed !
You kiss like you've studied how .
You're too forgiving .
We're still waiting for one more .
She is our principal demand , one of the first points of the treaty .
Come , Katherine Queen of All , reveal your heart to me in broken English .
Have you told him all her faults , Hortensio ?
You are my love , my love , I think .
You wouldn't have dared , out of fear for your life .
Tunis has never had such a beautiful queen .
Why are you giving me his title ?
What's that ?
Ah , my poor princes !
I'll spend tonight working to make something horrible happen .
Ah , ladies , ladies !
Then by all means never let her walk in public .
Thieves !
May God in heaven bless you .
Is it "chaste in word and action" ?
And when she left just now , she said "Take care of this poor fellow here." Fellow ! " Not "Malvolio , " not anything referring to my low station in life , but "fellow." Everything's going perfectly .
Madam , I'd better leave now .
The general is talking to you !
Let me at her ! .
To race after your departing ships , leaving his navy to watch , was a shame as great as the resulting loss .
Look , they're crying .
Be Conrade !
Two reasons .
Why does the world report that Kate is lame ?
Here's to Caesar .
Please , sir , be kind to me and tell me .
That awful , plodding rhyme sounded like a row of dairy women stomping off to market .
Good madam , let me speak .
Out .
The wolves have finished preying for the night , and look , the gentle dawn is rising , dappling the sleepy eastern sky with spots of light .
The table is full on both sides .
The gods can hear you lying !
Her reputation was as pure as the snow , but now it's as dirty and black as my own face .
That with a series of legal writs , Octavius , Antony , and Lepidus have put a hundred senators to death .
Leonato and his brother .
Sweet Desdemona !
I want to drink your health .
Well , that's certainly out of this world , all right .
It scares me just to hear you talk about it .
What's the matter ?
Can't you see that ?
Look , it's my dear Lady Disdain !
Ladies , you're dropping bread from the heavens to starving people .
You've lost your resolve .
Your life insurance ?
Still , I'd hate to see my former dreams return .
Go now , and pretend to be a friendly hostess .
Thinking , my lord ?
The ground is bloody .
And they respond to you with their hearts as well .
From the time I was seventeen , over sixty years ago , I have lived in this house , but now I will live here no more .
Let's go , Menas .
Sir , here's the Queen .
Yet I wish I could take that promise back , so I had it to give again .
He's calling us back .
The noblest men who ever walked on leather have walked on my handiwork .
I'll do the best I can , my lord .
Are you a married man or a bachelor ?
I'll warm myself by blowing on the fire .
I'll bet we're both thinking the same thing , master .
John Duke of Norfolk , Walter Lord Ferrers , Sir Robert Brakenbury , and Sir William Brandon .
Where's the necklace ?
I'll go and chat with Paris .
I'll find you another horse .
I know who you are .
Get off the field , my lord .
Oh , Juliet , I already know about your sad situation .
The queen is dead , my lord .
I have time for you now , my sad daughter .
From now on I will , cousin , and I'll think of all kinds of games for us .
Then the window lets day in , and life goes out the window .
Did you call me ?
Is this the family tomb of Leonato ?
Ratcliffe , around midnight come to my tent and help me put on my armor .
What is this fuzzy logic ?
If any legs here are Trinculo's , these are .
And I get sick when I can't look at you .
I don't see any blood .
Goodbye , Goodbye !
Give me your hand .
But truly , if I were as
When I first heard about him , he was still a bachelor .
My vision is dull .
Ma'am , you wouldn't treat me like this if I were your father's dog .
Watch over Signior Leonato's house ; with the wedding being held there tomorrow , there's a great to-do there tonight .
I have often led you , now you must carry me , my good friends , and take my thanks for everything .
Shame on you !
I'll have you whipped with wire and soaked in brine like a pickle , making your pain linger .
I'll lock up the doors , grab some more ducats , and be with you right away .
Madam , not yet .
Well then .
But I must go there , against my will : servants must fulfill their masters ' wishes .
Rogue , you've lived too long !
There's more to this ring than its cash value .
From the earth , or the air ?
It's no use !
Damn your wine !
Meet with the ambassadors .
Iago , give these letters to the ship's captain who brought me here , and ask him to pay my respects to the Senate of Venice .
Why has your queen , Juno , called me here to this grassy spot ?
What do you want ?
Be brave and do well !
I'll be getting my own figures together in the meantime .
Alright , I will .
My freedom .
My fair Bianca , bid my father welcome , while I with equal affection welcome yours .
Do you really think that if it came down to my word against yours , anyone would believe you ?
What should I do ?
How exactly have I offended you ?
I saw that .
My lord Sebastian , even though what you say is true , your way of saying it is tactless and comes at the wrong time .
Next time I'll give you nothing for something .
Your grief should not be equal to his worth , because then your sorrow would never end .
Yes , they are .
You call yourself my wife , yet you don't call me "husband" ?
The stuff you had at the Centaur , sir .
His letter will tell you how he's doing .
Stay here , Titinius .
So you don't love me ?
On the way , we came across my wife , her sister , and their gang of vile associates .
You think about him too much .
I don't think there's a single unhappy subject living under the protection of your government .
Won't he ?
But let him start off easy by killing one of us .
Oh , he's good at bending words around !
Oh , what a bloody end to all this !
Are you talking about young Master Launcelot ?
Let's be disciplined and not delay , because tomorrow is a busy day .
No , I'd rather be married to a skull with a bone in its mouth than to either of those men .
And I'm her father as well .
Beauty is a witch whose spells can turn loyalty into passion .
Whoever is born on a day I forget to send a message to Antony will die a beggar .
But tell me .
My dearest love , Duncan is coming here tonight .
I'm off to Venice .
See , now I have you .
Hang there on this tree , you lines of poetry , and bear witness to my love .
But he's not better than mine .
Yes , if it doesn't stand still .
Don't argue against it .
How are you , sir ?
Is that the rope ladder Romeo told you to pick up ?
The lowest part of his hoof is more musical than Pan's pipe .
See you soon .
She blushes from guilt , not modesty .
My good lord , I still need you to like me .
There's some gentleman out there. , Good Sir Toby !
Our action will seem too bloody if we cut off Caesar's head and then hack at his arms and legs too , Caius Cassius , because Mark Antony is merely one of Caesar's arms .
Mark Antony , Pardon me , Caius Cassius .
Seyton !
Did you go to bed so late , my friend , that you're having a hard time getting up now ?
Then Antony offered it the third time .
The Moor is being tricked by some crook , some terrible villain , some rotten bastard .
Otherwise , I'll do it anytime , as long as I'm able .
But I'm as immovable as the northern star , whose stable and stationary quality has no equal in the sky .
His wildness is a threat to all of us , to you , to me , to everyone .
He was my brother's son !
Who , me , my lord ?
When fools cry , you remain stony .
I bet it's a love letter !
Why would you have me betray the truth of my emotions and make my love wander in some other direction ?
This is his sword .
It's obvious to everyone that you've tricked her , drugged her , or kidnapped her .
But often in these cases , reports are just estimates .
Yes , and that's surprising , because lovers are usually early .
No ?
But we won't shift the scene to Southampton until Henry reappears .
Let me ask you a particular question .
I'll look into it further .
He died on Viola's thirteenth birthday .
Receive all the blessings of a happy father .
Are you his brother ?
They probably put him up to killing old man Gloucester to get his money .
How do you know ?
Why do people love you ?
Good night , good night .
How are you , my lord ?
I can tell your Majesty , the duke is a brave man .
Please , sir , I beg you .
Even if you're not a traitor , you're going to look like one if you run away .
We need a calendar !
Someone whose mood is as foul as the weather , very troubled .
Draw the curtains , just like that .
When I have the juice of that flower , I'll trickle some drops of it on Titania's eyes while she's sleeping .
Yes , that's for sure .
My message is not for anyone else to hear , my lady .
What do you want to say , sir ?
Let's go gather our jewels and money .
I won't be hit , my lord .
Damn you for teaching me your language !
Yes , I thank God , my father , and yourself .
Antonio's a good man .
I hope you enjoy the same sweet peace and rest I feel in my heart .
I see you've met with the jeweler .
No sir , trust me , I do not .
Oh , Lord , if they were married , they'd drive themselves crazy within a week .
Did he tell Macduff to return to Scotland ?
What's the problem , that they cry out so loud ?
Don't let that lawyer ever come near my house !
Thanks to your majesty .
What are you saying ?
with the same accessories .
Please do , madam .
When I strike , I'll cry , "All or nothing ! " Well put .
Here's a postscript ! .
Take away this body , and do what I say .
Come , I'll show you your bridal chamber .
Good-bye .
Yes , sir .
No , my lord .
I have done the deed .
Get out of my face .
I've always had great respect for your destiny .
But now I'll grit my teeth and kill anyone who tries to stop me .
For my part , I'm sorry this battle turned into a drinking match .
Captain Macmorris , I think , see , correct me if I'm wrong , there are not many of your nation , My nation ?
God be with you and keep you , and may he heal your head .
My sons Edward and Clarence !
Is this true ?
Where is the villain , Edmund ?
Do I look as pale as everyone else does , Lord Dorset ?
Set it down .
Come on , we have to follow the leaders of the dance .
If they let you off , then we'll have to assume that Lady Justice has lost all her power .
Please rise , Queen .
Sir , what is your opinion of me ?
I shall faint .
I'm glad Casca is with us .
Lucius !
She thanked me and told me that if a friend of mine had a story like mine to tell , she'd fall in love with him .
Winter garments need to be filled with something , And so does skinny Rosalind .
Well , sir , it's better to say little than to be tedious .
Wait until I read the letter .
But now I must condemn it .
Sure thing , we'll do it tomorrow morning .
This choice was as foolish as they are .
What name , madam ?
Didn't I buckle this well ?
Nothing , my lord .
What's the matter , husband ?
Then the two of them will both pursue one girl .
I am their father's mother .
What do you say , my fair I do not know dat .
I'd wager twenty times as much on my wife .
This is a love token from some other slut , and you want me to copy its pattern for you ?
I wish I had two fool's caps and two daughters .
No , but Beatrice , Sweet Hero , she's been wronged , she's been slandered , she's been ruined .
Come here , Proculeius .
Do you see that cloud up there that looks like a camel ?
That's all there is to it .
You can't blame anyone for it anyone , I say .
Find a father who loved his child as overwhelmingly as I loved Hero and ask
But if you have to swear , swear by your wonderful self , which is the god I worship like an idol , and then I'll believe you .
Yes , that's it .
The second cock crowed .
My name is Decretus .
Come , lady ; you must die in order to live .
Come and see the proof .
I'm not one of his sluts .
Wish me luck .
Curly golden hair moves so nicely in the wind and makes a woman beautiful .
They say that this town is full of deception , illusionists that can fool the eye , dark sorcerers who can bewitch your mind , soul-killing witches who can disfigure your body , disguised swindlers , fast-talking fakers , and all kinds of other unchecked sins .
I'm dying for food , so let me have some .
Well , she can get used to it .
Didn't I tell you to meet me outside and bring these morons with you ?
Now get out of here !
Here are the keys , and there is the duke , sleeping .
No wonder she's waiting to get married .
I'll meet it if it's the last thing I do .
Sure , or anything else you show him .
It was the most ruthless massacre this country has ever been guilty of .
I am , unless I somehow stole this role .
Good advice , indeed .
They are my daylight , my life .
Let me see , let me see .
Most noble man , will you die ?
It was a lovely wedding , and we're doing really well on our trip home .
I tell you , they are not honest men .
Nature , I don't accuse your weather of unkindness .
He's staying in the forest with your father now .
I met the young man at Lawrence's cell .
Don't just swear by it ; put your hand to some use that will prove you love me .
What happened , sir ?
Didn't you clearly say "Knock , " "pound , " and "put your fists to work" ?
And here's Regan , whose grotesque face betrays her twisted heart .
I beg your pardon , except for the widow Dido .
Ah , no .
I don't want to play now .
Sir , I'm half-blind .
Come to my cave and tell me the rest of your story. , Good old man , you are as welcome here as your master is .
Tonight let's have plenty to eat .
It's only going to make you sad , Monsieur Jaques .
My words are dull .
I wish that no one could avenge my cousin's death except me !
They drink Danes under the table , and it takes them no effort at all to out-drink Germans .
Have you written that letter to my sister yet ?
From the highest to the lowest of you , I bid you a hearty welcome .
I headed toward him , but he saw me coming and hid in the woods .
Portia is dead .
Somebody's knocking .
Fight valiantly today .
I'm sure his majesty will recover his health soon .
You've humiliated him , lady : you've put him down .
Defend yourself !
Caesar resents me , but he loves Brutus .
How are you and your master getting along ?
Show us the way .
Titinius , if you love me , get on your horse and spur him on until he's brought you to those troops and back again , so that I can find out whether those troops are friends or enemies .
Don't worry , I'll be there .
But whenever you feel a larger pain , the smaller one disappears .
I hope , sir , that you're not angry that I've been equally attentive to you both !
Damn my suspicious thoughts !
for the other men , we can make them believe anything we choose .
This is the perfect place to rehearse .
Will you come to bed , my lord ?
No rescue for me ?
Now , as you're a Roman , tell me the truth .
But if the cause is not just , the king himself will have a lot to answer for , when all those legs and arms and heads chopped off in battle shall join together on Judgment Day crying , "We died at such and such a place." Some will be swearing , some crying for a surgeon , some for the wives that are destitute without them , some about the debts they owed , some for their children left unprovided for .
Oh , Caesar , this Charmian lived until a moment ago .
I've made a risky investment .
Oh sir , I accept .
Good morning , my noble lord .
I have so much care and pity for you that you could call me friend .
Why do you ask ?
Good , very good .
I'll confess to you that I love him .
Come with me .
Give me one kiss , and I'll go down .
How are you , my pretty Bianca ?
Make your confession short .
I'm sorry to have to say this , Help me away from here , dear Charmian !
Sir Topas !
I can't pull a cart or eat dried oats like a horse .
Honest , my lord ?
Thank you , doctor .
I'll answer for you .
You have to be my torchbearer for the masquerade .
I can't love him .
How are you , Malvolio ?
Take some memento from us as a token of our gratitude , not as a fee .
Get rid of half your knights and go back to spend the rest of your month with my sister .
Isn't he a horrible man ?
The poor people died .
If you interrupt it , he'll foam at the mouth and go crazy .
Oh , Ophelia , I'm bad at poetry .
That upsets me much more than getting wet .
Where are those bastards ?
Well , let's sit down and listen to Barnardo tell us .
Is that how it is , really ?
I won't have one any bigger .
But tell me honestly , are you sure you're not insane ?
And I hope you won't think badly of me .
I've said nothing wrong .
I don't know , madam .
She's mine , and I'm giving her to Demetrius .
That your interest payments are like Jacob's sheep ?
What was your dream ?
That's great .
First , he said you had no right to him .
Now I see that you can't call anything good except in right context .
Oh yes , I heard them all , and more , too .
All this fighting is because of you .
His name is Balthazar .
He was my friend , he was faithful and just to me .
Oh , how bitter it is that Edward , the real "true , noble prince" , should still be alive !
I am his brother , and I love him very much .
That might be the case sir ,
No .
She shall be buried next to her Antony .
Tell her that I , her king , am her lowly subject .
And if she starts to drop off , I'll rant and yell until I wake her up .
She says that you should come to her .
Your words have moved me , and maybe it'll do some good .
I'm awkward in my speech and I'm not a smooth talker .
Why , that's just the way to frustrate their plans and defeat their absurd intentions .
He and I will make up .
You are building your nest in
She is dead .
If you mutiny against me , I'll hang you from the next tree .
Handkerchief , confessions , handkerchief !
Until then , God be with you !
You haven't been conquered .
What's the matter ?
Where's lady Portia ?
But why , why , why ?
The dust from your attending troops should have risen to heaven .
Here comes the good Macduff .
You should get a wife !
What about Stanley ?
He was happy here , listening to a song .
I'll limp after you .
Who would do that ?
King Edward was going to marry Lady Lucy , your mother can vouch for that , and then he was betrothed to Bona , the King of France's sister-in-law .
But where is he ?
I know all of this .
Why are you looking for me ?
Why , the one I just told you about .
You lover of that damned whore , you're talking to me of "ifs" ?
This damned witch Sycorax was kicked out of Algiers for various witching crimes too terrible for humans to hear about .
I learned to do this from you .
Take this garment , put it on , and then come back here .
Against my will , I've been told to bring you in to dinner .
We'll all want our fortune told .
The reason I think he's insane , besides the way he just acted , is that he told a senseless story over lunch about being locked out of his own house .
Yes , he was hotheaded even in the prime of his life .
Did you give everything to your two daughters and end up like this ?
Did you see the weird sisters ?
Farewell .
Yeah , so ?
His nurse ?
This is a sleepy tune .
They will steal anything and call it spoils .
Well , that's an Stay , fellow .
Fear will keep you safe .
That's why there must be space between you .
Go , lad , and find out what the trumpet's sounding for .
I won't say a word .
Is this true ?
Now they've turned around and are clearly heading for Cyprus .
Some of them are leaning already .
Don't move , dog .
Has anyone ever courted a woman in this state of mind ?
How should madmen hear , if wise men can't even see ?
Madam , here comes your husband .
I wish she were in love with me instead .
Tell them you know that Hero loves me .
I saw it in the orchard .
It was just that the showiness of his grief sent me into a fury .
Lord , " he calls you ?
If you like what you see of the land , the profit that's possible , and this rustic life , I'll be your faithful servant , and buy the place with your gold right away .
He won't listen to anyone's advice .
Since she would love both of you , you two would be joined in that love .
Double , double toil and trouble , Fire burn and cauldron bubble .
Wake up my whole household !
Don't let the Nurse stay with you in your bedroom .
Shall I let them exhibit me to the shouting mobs of Rome ?
No .
That governs the torso and heart , doesn't it ?
The door's right here .
Friends , go your separate ways .
Good .
I'm here , full of anger , to complain about my daughter Hermia. , Step forward , Demetrius. , My lord , this man , Demetrius , has my permission to marry her. , Step forward , Lysander. , But this other man , Lysander , has cast a magic spell over my child's heart. , You , you , Lysander , you've given her poems , and exchanged tokens of love with my daughter .
Don't say anything .
It's "never get tired." Oh !
In that case , the wise gods deny our prayers for our own good .
Pay him six thousand and cancel the debt .
Out of love ?
I sent the Nurse at nine o'clock .
Well then , here's more money for you .
I can make my handwriting look just like Lady Olivia's : she
Could that be a lawyer's skull ?
Then learn this from me : if you have something , you have it .
I should backtrack and begin with how my master , Don John , arranged for the Prince , Claudio , and himself to witness this friendly encounter from the orchard .
But didn't you expect us to cut the cloth ?
Goodbye .
But it's enough .
My boy , it's true .
Yes , you have to tell us why , Sir Andrew .
Come out .
That's how things should be , straight and smooth .
Tonight is for celebrating !
I was bound to him an hour ago , sir , but thankfully he chewed through our ropes .
He can't give his house away to his daughters , leaving himself without shelter .
And , my dear sister , as long as the winds are blowing and ships are sailing , let me hear from you , write .
Or are you just teasing ?
There's little or nothing of that .
So I'm free .
Lovely , most lovely Katherine , will you agree to teach a soldier the words that would recommend his love-suit to a gentle heart like yours ?
It takes a good priest to practice what he preaches .
You should know , my friends , that I have good hopes for tomorrow , and that I will lead you as if I expect victory rather than an honorable death .
Well , Susan died and is with God .
Edmund is dead , my lord .
Let me go , or I'll knock you on the head .
Lorenzo , please take charge of the management of my house until my husband comes back .
What can I do for you , sir ?
You were born from a woman .
It sounds more like you're insulting me .
But a terminal disease requires extreme treatment , or nothing at all .
If you have tears , prepare to shed them now .
What villains did this to you ?
Then it's certain they're heading for Cyprus .
Lucillius and Titinius , order the commanders to have the men camp for the night .
Oh , look , sir , look , sir !
I didn't see anybody use you for kicks .
Early in the morning I'll go visit Desdemona and plead my case .
That's right , uncle , talk to your heart , like the Good morning to you both .
Don't be shy , shake hands with me .
On , on , you noblest Englishmen , descended as you are from battle-tested fathers , fathers who , like so many Alexander the Greats , have fought in these regions from morning until night , sheathing their swords only when there was no one left to fight .
Madam , keep up hope .
Yes , my lord .
You there , rogue , what do you have to say about that ?
What's this song ?
I wish it were over .
It came from a neutral party , not from someone opposed to you .
You are your father's daughter .
There aren't three people in all of Egypt who could do better .
I'm sticking to the contract .
Is he attacking the heartland of Poland or some frontier ?
Oh , Tybalt , Tybalt , he was the best friend I had .
Bassanio , we'll say goodbye for now , since you've found Antonio .
Oh , what a horrible day !
Please come closer. , Make the music louder , please !
I am still so faithful , my lord .
Take me to Antony .
He has distinguished himself as a great soldier in his own right , deserving more than any honor your can bestow on him .
I've practiced Stoicism with as much devotion as you , but I still couldn't bear this news like you do .
I'll go get Beatrice for you , who can walk here by herself , she has legs .
Me , marry her ?
What wicked magician has conjured up this devil to interrupt this sacred burial rite ?
That's how it was with Henry the Sixth , who was crowned in Paris when he was only nine months old .
I heard Octavius say that Brutus and Cassius have ridden like madmen through the gates of Rome .
Have you seen a farmer's dog bark at a beggar ?
Nurse , where's my daughter ?
It's the blessed sun .
It isn't proper for you to know how much Caesar loved you .
Keep an eye on him .
Let's go .
And when has he ever been known to wash his face ?
He'll recover his sanity there .
Metellus Cimber ?
What's this ?
I wish my father could see them with my eyes .
Please go away , both of you .
Do you remember the circumstances ?
It was love that performed these miracles .
If she rants , I'll tell her that she sings as sweetly as a nightingale .
Hurry up , Robin , and make the night dark and cloudy .
I didn't write about breaking the alliance with Antony until I saw you were being misled and realized how dangerous it would be to keep postponing preparations .
Sir , sir , that can't be true .
What's the news , brave soldier ?
I'll talk to you again tomorrow .
That was a humorous message .
Claudio !
If you had been afraid to break an oath with him , the crown you are currently wearing would have graced the head of my child , and both princes would still be alive , not preyed on by worms .
What did you mean by giving me this handkerchief ?
But just be patient until we've calmed the masses , who are beside themselves with fear .
And tell her , listen to me , on Wednesday , Wait , What day is today ?
You must go to Parthia .
Little pitchers have big ears .
In the same hour , and in the same inn , a poor woman also delivered identical twin boys .
Come on , show me the wound that my eyes have caused .
I'll tell him the news .
Bring him to me .
The other half goes to the state .
My lady told me to tell you that while she lets you stay at her house because you're a relative , she doesn't approve of your behavior .
No , please don't hate him , for my sake .
Have you forgotten all the talks we've had together , the vows we made to be like sisters to one another , all the hours we spent together , wishing that we never had to say goodbye , have you forgotten ?
So stay for a while .
Farewell .
You don't have to go yet .
I bet it's a challenge .
Your royal father is murdered .
Take up the body .
I have no doubt that it will be a swift and successful war , since God so graciously exposed this dangerous plot .
Where is kind Hastings ?
Oh , just lies , sir .
Where's Monsieur Cobweb ?
Sounds good to us .
He's a good man .
Wouldn't it be better , since I'm unusually tall for a woman , to dress myself like a man ?
I have bankrupted three tailors .
And I had to be away !
But if you remember , I didn't tell you to parody the style .
Bring me some light , gentlemen , I'll bind the wound with my shirt .
In bed with her ?
They've eaten themselves sick .
We'll be there .
The night's too rough for humans to bear .
She was utterly true to you !
I never saw it or suspected it , so it never hurt me .
That's Enobarbus ?
Listen to me patiently .
Oh , and I know who loves him .
Didn't you tell me that I'd be able to recognize the man by the Athenian clothes he was wearing ?
I hope your Majesty will , in all good conscience , bear me out and vouch for the fact that this is the glove of Alencon and that your Majesty gave it to me .
From this , I conclude that many different elements can work toward one common end , just as many arrows , shot from different points , converge on a single target ; just as many roads meet in a single town ; just as many fresh streams empty into only one salt sea ; just as the many radiuses of a
Anyway , go tell your master I am here .
Carthage ?
What kind of devil are you to torture me like this ?
Do whatever you like with it .
It's gone .
I mean I will live on whatever I get , like birds do .
Do you think I would be feeling as triumphant as I am if I didn't know that our situation was secure ?
Wash your hands .
What do you think will be the result of this storm ?
And so , good-bye .
Where's the Master , Boatswain ?
Pish to you , you mangy dog , you pointy-eared Icelandic mutt .
Nobody like that should be trusted .
But a handkerchief , God , I wish I could forget about the handkerchief !
And we will raise your wages .
Look , sir , here it comes !
What is your wish with regard to her ?
Look , here she comes , with your ungovernable wives in tow , like prisoners of her womanly persuasion. , Katherine , that cap of yours doesn't look good on you .
Think about our situation , then die .
I would , if I had a mirror .
I drink to you .
Here an angel's lying in a golden bed. , Give me the key .
Oh , I wish I had my rosary !
But what do I care about words ?
Hey , let's have some music here !
Your Majesty shall mock at me .
Goodbye , then .
I found her adjusting the crown on her dead mistress .
Didn't I use to have four or five women taking care of me ?
Then don't make yourself too conspicuous .
That will please God , who has him now .
Your logic is so foolish .
Some are born great , "
But how strange that Beatrice should seem to know who I was and yet not know at the same time .
I got it from you , I never said I didn't .
I'll write how , under his flag and with his well-paid troops , we have beaten the formerly unvanquished Parthia .
The wind is right and it's high tide , and I've delayed him a long time already .
We didn't please them on land .
Oh ho !
Come on , servant , come .
I can tell by how pale and deathlike they look .
So , where should we eat ?
Give it to my wife , and get your money .
But no matter , I'll get back at him soon enough .
My lord , good morning .
Is that Barnardo ?
No , my lord .
It's a lie , you thread , you thimble , you measurement !
I don't think any woman like that exists .
Heaven help us !
If there's anything more sorrowful left to add , keep it to yourself .
We'll draw straws .
Has she already forgotten her brave husband , Prince Edward , whom I stabbed on the battlefield three months ago in my anger ?
Sister , you know he promised to give me a necklace .
Do you hear what I'm saying , Iago ?
All right , I'll stop .
Is that the man ?
But shhh !
But please tell me , can you read anything you see ?
We'll probably witness many more outbursts from him , like banishing Kent .
I wish I could work for that lady !
Is something about to happen that warrants working this night and day ?
I'm not possessed !
But step aside , fairy !
Ah , he got you back , Benedick !
We'll see , won't we ?
Damn it !
As for Antony , I'm not interested in his requests .
Oh , Stephano , two men from Naples survived !
I'll scalp you .
Keep an eye on Cinna .
Was I even close to you in the chase for the goose ?
Good-bye , sir .
My noble lords and relatives , good morning .
Look out , he's coming !
In the entire play , not one word is well-written , and not one of the actors is right for his part .
Lysander and I are running away from here .
You see , her eyes are open .
And has anyone ever won her , as I've done ?
Peace to you , my lord of Burgundy .
The law's on my side .
Wait , good Beatrice .
You .
Go , take your sweetheart and leave him to me .
Let's lay everything upon the king : our lives , our souls , our debts , our anxious wives , our children , and our sins." I must bear responsibility for all of it .
It's hard to see clearly in the dark of night , but it's easier to hear well .
I beg you to pardon me .
I must be one of these silent so-called wise men Gratiano's talking about , because he never lets me get a word in .
Other than Richard , even those whom we fight against would rather we won .
But my dear , when I said I was worth nothing , I was actually bragging , I should've said that I was worse than nothing .
Show him and make him grieve .
It wouldn't be right for me to tell you everything I've seen and heard .
I'm your neighbor and came courting first .
Meet me down at the harbor. , Come here .
I'll bring you there .
You mock an ancient tradition , born of reverence and worn in honor of brave men who have died , and then have the gall not to stand by your words .
If you stop up the keyhole , it will escape from the chimney along with the smoke .
I swear on my life , which I take pretty seriously , even if I am a magician .
So , so , so , so !
Yes , mother , but I wish I hadn't .
I hope that God restores you to health .
I can't believe it." The tears fell from her eyes like holy water .
I tell you , I feel very jolly remembering such a beautiful dream .
If you act like my daughter , I'll marry you to my friend .
Thank you .
This shepherd boy reminds me quite vividly of my daughter .
Oh , there's the problem .
Go .
Caesar loses supporters wherever he raises money .
Yes , my lord .
Is the king leaving here today ?
Now , Catesby , what does your lord say to my request ?
Regret and everlasting shame sit on our helmets , mocking us .
But now I have joyful news for you , girl .
If I didn't have so many enemies in Orsino's court , I'd go join you there .
Who is that gentleman ?
Goodbye , my sweet lord. , Goodbye , my sister .
Is there a murderer here ?
You knew , no one knew , no one knew as well as you did , about my daughter's plans to run away .
We shouldn't displease him .
I'm afraid the people have made Caesar their king .
Last night , when that star to the west of the North Star had traveled across the night sky to that point where it's shining now , at one o'clock , Marcellus and I , Quiet , shut up !
No , it was a little one , not more than a pint .
I remember his face well .
Where's Antony now ?
Seek !
What are the chances of his getting better , lords ?
Yes , madam , but he'll be back tonight .
You're afraid of the boar but you go around without your spear ?
We need a more appropriate place to discuss Cordelia and her father .
Does he look as bright and handsome as the day we saw him wrestling ?
You'll fall backward when you grow up , won't you , Jule ? " And she stopped crying and said , "Yes." Now you stop too , Nurse , please .
My uncle is king of Denmark , and the same people who made fun of him while my father was still alive are now rushing to pay twenty , forty , fifty , a hundred ducats apiece for miniature portraits of him .
That's what I intend to do too .
Come down , brother .
I don't know that , once he knows what I know .
She'll confirm everything .
Was he sent by Count Orsino ?
I hate the Moor , and there's a widespread rumor that he's slept with my wife .
Then I guess I was misled .
Antipholus has gone insane , no question about it .
To Adriana ?
Our Queen is dead too .
The coroner's inquest law .
I knew a girl who was married in an afternoon as she went to the garden for parsley to stuff a rabbit .
The sweet and bitter fool Will appear right away .
Let's have explicit contracts drawn up to ensure that both sides keep their promises .
You tell her , widow !
I'll do all that .
This disrespectful stance toward the man who is your lord , your king , your governor tarnishes your beauty the way the frosts of winter blights the land .
You don't have to worry about any of these lords , my lady .
Those men you just mentioned will be beheaded today .
Tell me , are you and Ensign Pistol friends again yet ?
Stanley , what news do you have ?
It's Cinna .
Didn't you hear someone shouting ?
I won't bother with it .
Men , wives , and children stare , cry out , and run in the streets as though it were doomsday .
Good morning , Richmond .
I think so too .
I've heard that the pyramids build by the Ptolemies are splendid .
I've heard many of the noblest Romans , next to immortal Caesar , speaking of you , complaining of the tyranny of today's government , and wishing that your eyes were working better .
If it pleases Caesar to be so good to himself as to hear me , I'll try to get him to do what's good for him .
He'll wake you up , I bet .
Before sunrise tomorrow , we'll kill anyone who escaped today .
Didn't I deserve anything more than a fool's head ?
Bring me an exact report of the number of dead on both sides .
This is getting worse and worse !
But if you were married , you'd wield some influence .
Is his army approaching ?
He's not telling the truth .
Claudio , take my daughter , and , with her , take my fortunes .
Here's the east .
Don't tire yourself out , monsieur .
You don't know how to pick a man .
Go back , slave , or I'll knock you one across the head .
Blab my nonsense !
Goodbye .
Write them together , yours is just as good a name .
Let's proceed to the field .
You had rotten food , and he helped you eat it .
Did you mention that Edward's children are bastards ?
Are we all here ?
Oh God , whose side I think I'm fighting on , look kindly on my forces .
Would your Honor like to try this dried fruit ?
In our case , our bad neighbors over their make us early risers , a healthy and sensible thing to be .
Should I tell you why ?
Don't talk to me , because I won't say a word .
Pardon me but I do not know what is "like me." An angel is like you , Kate , and you are like an angel .
And my sweet master , I received no gold .
Please just name a time , but don't wait more than three days .
Lead the way .
Look at the three little dogs , Tray , Blanch , and Sweetheart , all barking at me .
What , just because they kissed in private ?
Now he's saying how she took him into our bedroom .
But you can't blame me for her offenses .
Robin Starveling , the tailor ?
Bring him in front of me .
You had this child with the help of heaven .
Wait , madam .
Who's talking to him now ?
Love's messengers should be thoughts , which fly ten times faster than sunbeams .
Then the liars are fools , for there are enough liars in the world to beat up the honest men and hang them .
We won't hold back any of our wisdom .
They're speaking to him .
But he's sleeping .
Yes , hand me one too .
They fled toward Peloponnesus .
What , you mean my face looks like a crab-apple ?
Three-time traitor and whore !
You should know I've earned a thousand gold pieces from Don John .
My master will be here in the morning .
If I remember correctly , I can't raise the entire three thousand ducats immediately .
And keep yourself hidden , I command you .
Write to him immediately .
I never saw my father in my life .
Calm down .
Don't say anything else .
No , let's follow him .
I am glad he's coming , however he's dressed .
If you do , please give it to me , because I need to start learning the lines .
Where's your conscience now ?
Today he fought as though he were a god who hated mankind .
Although you deserve praise , applause , and love , right now the duke misconstrues everything you've done .
Please listen to me carefully .
Only if the hearer is a fool or a coward .
I'll go as fast as I can , madam .
Yes , my master .
Today I'm going to get what I said I wished would happen to me if I was ever false to King Edward's children or his wife's allies .
God be with you all .
Where is she ?
Here , here I'll remain with worms that are your chamber-maids .
Put on your nightgown , in case someone comes and sees that we're awake .
Some of this liquor's still left in the goblet .
You know I would never approve a war against my own cause .
How can you test them like that ?
Give me an almanac .
The enemy approaches with great display .
They have to stay there .
Get out of here , my friend .
The Constable of France .
Even the fiercest wild animal has some touch of pity .
What is it ?
The world's gone downhill since fake humility started passing for compliments .
Why ?
I assure you he can .
Can any of your neighbors tell , Kate ?
Signed , she who would be your servant , The Fortunate Unhappy." This is as clear as sunlight in an open field .
The senate has decided to give mighty Caesar a crown today .
I'm proud to be Sir Rowland's son , his youngest son , and I would never change that , not even to be Frederick's adopted heir .
What right did he have to scold me like that ?
I'll stand guard with you tonight .
Is there any news about my husband ?
Hello there , sir !
His breath stinks .
The play's the thing to uncover the conscience of the king .
Remember you !
And now you know my meaning .
And I will spend our time apart on my knees , praying for you .
Draw your sword and get on your toes , because your assailant is quick , skillful , and deadly .
I wonder why Cambio hasn't shown up in all this time .
Look how your servants wait on you , each one ready to do whatever you command .
I'm telling you , get out of here , and don't follow me around like this .
Are you always so funny ?
Stand close together , in case someone loyal to Caesar tries to , Don't talk about standing together. , Publius , cheer up .
Leave me alone .
To hell with you !
It's the death of half the world .
Look , he's recovering .
Where should we stable our horses ?
Remember March , March 15th .
Be patient , because you're staying with me .
We've all come out to see what will happen. , Go , Hercules !
Oh , what a villain !
Shall I be tempted by the devil ?
So how short am I , you painted barber pole ?
Come on , wake up , wake up , wake up !
Otherwise I would have been perfect , as solid as a piece of marble , as firm as a rock , as free as the air itself .
You stopped me .
I'm begging you , good Mercutio , let's call it a day .
He's just Launcelot .
I wish I were in an alehouse in London !
This is the plague of important men , our wives betray us more than those of poor men .
Look who's coming : a young man and an old man , having a serious talk .
Is that you , Diomedes ?
That's the truth , sir .
I have a favor to ask .
I will advise him to speak as he usually does .
Thanks , Guildenstern and worthy Rosencrantz .
Too fast is as bad as too slow .
Goodbye .
A pound of human flesh taken isn't even as valuable as a pound of mutton or beef .
And here he comes , puffing himself up like a turkey .
Oh , I'm dying , Horatio !
If wolves had been howling outside your gate at the heart of that storm , you would've told your doorman to let them in , despite all the cruelties you inflict on the world .
It's a play about ten words long , which is the shortest play I've ever heard of .
We'll see you tomorrow .
There , my lord .
What's that trumpet for ?
Go and tell my daughter I want to speak with her .
Neither the sky nor the earth have been quiet tonight .
And then , I hope , you'll be satisfied .
In God's name , who are you ?
Isn't there one man left in the world who knows not to take a wife ?
My husband .
Who are you ?
I wish they were , so that I could die right now , because , at this point , I live a living death .
Step aside .
True , " she said , "a fine little one." "No , " I said , "a huge wit." "Right , " she said , "a hugely awful one." "No , " I said , "he has a good wit." "Exactly , " she said , "it's good and mild ; it doesn't hurt anyone." "No , " I said , "Benedick is wise." "He is certainly , " she said , She cried a lot at that , and said she didn't care .
What makes you say that ?
We're off to eat and whoop it up at your father's house .
I swear , I scorn the word .
I'd prefer to keep my mistress rather than some lame horse .
Yes , sweet Rosalind .
I'm finished , then .
Soak your hands in blood and gore , since you have cut the thread of his life with scissors .
My lord , I informed them as much .
Wake up , wake up !
No , sir .
What's up , man ?
That's the way it should be , only Antony should conquer Antony .
Make the best use of this information you can .
I'm glad .
Oh , wine is the devil !
Oh sweet Nurse , what news do you bring ?
Foolish dogs , blindly running straight toward a Russian bear only to have their heads crushed like rotten apples .
I know him well by reputation .
Tomorrow , soldier , I'll fight by sea and land .
Yes , ma'am .
Murder and treason !
That's true .
Leave me quickly .
Anyone who wants to separate us will have to smoke us out of the cave of our togetherness like foxes .
Come along with us , Signor Fabian .
This is the fool who lent out money without charging interest .
I'm the one who , I'll get right on that .
What about Falconbridge , that young English baron ?
Hurry now , get the job done .
Quick , quick .
And when that time comes , then you can mock me , but please don't pity me , because I won't pity you .
Get us out of here .
I'm dying an innocent woman .
Go then , slave .
Are you mad ?
Edmund , go find him .
With that I kiss your hand and call you my queen .
You're snoring , but it sounds like you're talking .
Somebody's knocking .
Edward's sons have been carried off by the angels and Anne , my wife , has bid good night to the world .
It's not manly to cry .
My sweet , so do I .
Please wait , sir .
Farewell to you both .
His ships are maneuverable .
Let's sit here and let the music fill our ears .
My lord , how are you feeling ?
Let's go !
Go and put on your own armor .
The duke of York sends your Majesty his respects .
What's the matter ?
Here comes my little bird .
We understand you're just doing it for us , and we'll be sure to say so .
And I think that if I hadn't been brave and strong , she would have turned me into a dog and made me her slave .
I swear , you speak the truth .
Dear gods , bless this couple , since you're the ones who have shown us the path that led us here .
He left behind myself and my twin sister , who was born in the same hour as me .
I'll do it with all my heart .
You'd better not wear your dagger in your cap that day , or he might slap your head with it .
Why are you calling him a jerk ?
Worse than that , she's polluted herself , so that the fountain is a place where disgusting toads copulate and reproduce !
I know how to tell when someone is alive or dead .
It must go like this .
It would be smart to offer someone poor and innocent like me as a sacrificial lamb to satisfy an angry god like Macbeth .
Who are all these people ?
But she is no virgin .
Where are my slippers ?
Whoo-hoo !
But like I said , when she tasted the bitter wormwood on my nipple , the pretty little babe got irritated and started to quarrel with my breast .
Then where would you have me go , Adam ?
Madam , I'm a bit like you in that I can't tolerate a tone of disapproval .
No more talk about my father ; you'll be whipped for slander one of these days .
No , first let's talk to him .
But I would rather abstain from everything for four days than drink so much in one .
Kind and dear princess !
Katherine the shrew ! " That's the worst thing you can call a young woman .
Believe me , King of Illusions , I made a mistake .
The most you hope for was for her to marry wealthy and rise up the social ladder , that was your idea of heaven .
Look , his noble blood is still on it .
Then he says I didn't return some ships he loaned me .
The words expressly specify "a pound of flesh." So take your penalty of a pound of flesh , but if you shed one drop of Christian blood when you cut it , the state of Venice will confiscate your land and property under Venetian law .
Quiet , children , quiet .
Why are our bodies soft and weak and smooth , unfit for toil and trouble in the world , if not so that our soft qualities and our hearts should agree with our external parts ?
There's another .
Something there isn't a word for .
Your life is stretched to its limit .
I'm done for in this world , I believe .
These vows are just traps for stupid birds .
In Rome , Madam .
This island contains everything beneficial to life .
I know him ; he wears a lock of hair .
So much for our plan .
They made more money and got more attention in the city .
Has she told Benedick how she feels ?
I'll do what I can to make you even more comfortable .
Then he's no good .
He'll just turn it into a joke and torment the poor woman even more .
You're sharpening that knife not on your sole but on your soul , you cruel Jew .
When she put it on my finger , she made me swear never to sell it , give it away , or lose it .
I've seen both of you fence .
But could beauty be related to anything better than goodness ?
Make sure that the clowns do not ad-lib , since some of them will make certain dumb audience members laugh mindlessly at them , while an important issue in the play needs to be addressed .
This villain is much quicker than I am .
The fact that he serves as a go-between for his lord and my niece Olivia confirms this .
Who's Thisbe ?
The things I'm saying are fair and honest .
I'll give Thank you , darling .
You are nothing like Mark Antony !
And since you know you can see yourself best by reflection , I'll be your mirror and show you , without exaggeration , things inside you that you can't see .
If they seek battle with us , have them come down or else clear the field .
For you , our swords have blunt edges , too dull to harm you , Mark Antony .
You have some plea for Caesar , don't you ?
Lord , how painful it was to drown .
Caesar , the clock has struck eight .
You're awfully eager to fight .
I'll get your goats , Audrey .
I'll think of something .
How can this be ?
I'm sure nobody would have any reason to fight with me .
Sirs , take up the corpse .
England would be lucky to have this virtuous prince as king .
Is he losing his mind ?
In every good thing they do .
You can't see the future .
Sadness over my son's exile stopped her breath .
Just because I act familiar with you sometimes and let you fool around and joke with me , you try to take advantage of my affection .
Goodbye to the horses and the trumpets and the drums , the flute and the splendid banners , and all those proud displays and pageantry of war !
Yes , husband .
In order to flatter Caesar , would you flirt with the servant who laces up his pants ?
And who is England's king but an heir of the great York ?
But this would be too cold a place to sleep if he hadn't warmed himself with ale .
In the meantime , hold on , and be patient .
How did you get this letter ?
Yes , like that .
If he can manage to walk after our fight , I'll never wrestle for money again .
Welcome , good Robin .
Good Macbeth , we're ready when you are .
You've kept away from me for a week ?
What is , my lord ?
No , nothing .
It's been eleven years since the earthquake .
Where did he go ?
It was tossed into the window of my room .
If I died right now I'd be completely happy , since I'll probably never be as happy as this again in my life .
Oh , Regan , she's torn me apart with unkindness , like a vulture , right here .
All right .
Go get it and bring it to me here in the orchard .
Let's take a little walk in the orchard before dinner .
Look , Don Pedro has come back for you .
Consider it done , my lord .
No other grave on earth shall hold a pair this famous .
When he wakes up !
Even my hair revolts .
He stayed like that a long time .
Go wake Juliet .
This makes me feel so much better !
you will And what if he won't stop ?
I'll get some cloth and egg whites to bandage his bleeding face .
Welcome , my good friends .
When I freed you from slavery , didn't you swear to do this when I asked you ?
Watch her .
That's always true .
Where have you been , boy ?
The warships have sent a dozen messages tonight , one after the other , and many of the senators have been awakened and are at the Duke's already .
Please , master , tell me .
Well then , good bye , my lord .
Talkers aren't good doers .
Our business now is mourning and grief .
So that England may live a long life like this , let God say amen !
But even so , we can't do without him .
Why , so did you .
Protect me , my friends .
I'll kill myself out of grief !
Come , let's join our hands until the overpowering wine makes us soft and forgetful .
My lord , what do you want ?
Oh , that's with worry .
It's probably some noble gentleman stopping off in mid-journey , thinking to spend the night here .
We have slashed the snake but not killed it .
It's time to end it , good lady .
Aren't you a rational human being ?
No woman's heart is big enough to hold all my love .
It's our destiny , like death .
Show your slaves how mad you are , and make your servants tremble .
He's so flighty in his old age , as we keep noticing .
I'd better not drink now .
Tell me , don't you have a virtuous and lovely daughter named Katherina ?
My friends , listen .
Good lieutenant , is your general married ?
I'm very sorry you're not feeling well .
Oh , he's been betrayed , and I've been ruined .
Understand ?
That way Antony will feel like he's fighting his own men .
My spirit friend , Harpier , is yelling , "It's time , it's time ! " Dance around the cauldron and throw in the poisoned entrails .
Yes , madam , that's the one .
What's wrong with you ?
The enemy's losses have been very great , pretty substantial .
Your wives , your daughters , your old women , and your young maids together could not satisfy my lust .
Tell our top commanders that I want tomorrow's battle to be the last we fight .
Get up early tomorrow , at the sound of the lark , noble Norfolk .
Here I am at your service , my dear lord .
Aren't I your Rosalind ?
Come on in , con man .
Raise all the money you can .
Take out your sword and come on .
Didn't he say my brother has run away ?
It's nobler to leap in ourselves than dawdle until they push us .
She has betrayed me and shall die .
Your grandsons will neigh to you like horses .
More than anything else in the world , I love you , value you , and honor you .
Well , I've begun my reign with a carefully thought-out plan , and I have every hope of succeeding .
I really don't know .
So the weak third of the triumvirate is imprisoned until death frees him .
I was telling you to go after her , woo her , confront her .
What , is trusting a friend such a crime ?
Didn't you hear their shouts ?
Those are only two of his weapons .
I'll take responsibility for it .
I don't think about them now .
Will you do that for me , Silvius ?
You are Dromio , you are my servant , and you are yourself .
Knock , knock !
Honestly , sir , we say that we are not criminals .
She'd laugh me right out of my body and kill me with her wit .
How's the night going , boy ?
What do you think of this fool , Malvolio ?
But please , tell me the worst thing that could happen to me if I refuse to marry Demetrius .
Do you love me ?
Is he still alive , good uncle ?
Beware Macduff .
It's hard to make sense of such different stories .
Aren't the playwrights hurting them by making them upstage adult actors , which they are going to grow up and become ?
When you see him walking by here ( as I'll make sure he does between twelve and one ) you can nab him .
I'll do it .
From this moment on I have a higher opinion of you than before .
I remember when I was in love , I broke my sword on a stone , and told him to take that for coming at night to see Jane Smile .
Even though Birnam Wood really did come to Dunsinane , and I'm fighting a man not of woman born , I'll fight to the end .
The villain won't escape .
It's a nice hand , an open one .
They stared at us in confusion .
In that case it's your imagination that's interesting , not the play .
I don't feel so well , but I won't stop .
Come help me bless this couple , so they will be prosperous and have many children .
I've only made it this far since I left her place , walking at a moderate pace .
We're not getting any younger .
He's made me a Christian .
The Duke of Cornwall , my master and patron , is arriving tonight .
It's new to you .
When I have praised Antony , I've disparaged Caesar .
I'm Lorenzo , your love .
Put it together with something else .
Oh , I thank my lucky stars , I'm so happy .
We haven't yet encountered that danger , and the best thing to do is avoid it entirely .
Quiet there !
Go on , Caesar .
Run , run , oh , run !
Kill Brutus and be honored by the killing .
Come on , don't quarrel with us , good old man .
The king of England's approach is as forceful as a whirlpool .
This repays me .
What , would you let a snake bite you twice ?
Go away now and in the morning meet me in the pit by the river in hell .
I don't like it .
You've served me faithfully .
Oh , if only my smiles could inspire love as effectively as your frowns !
Where's my fool ? , Go call my fool and have him come here .
Where are you , keeper ?
Help me .
Battered armor , be off .
Here comes the man himself .
The people are on my side , and I'm in charge of the sea .
God say , "Amen" !
Don't be afraid , even though you see me with a weapon .
Oh , Antonio , I'm sorry I caused you so much trouble .
It will be hard if "Cambio" loses her .
He is , my lord , and safe in Leicester , where , if you'd like , we can retreat to .
Oh , you're a naughty one , encouraging double-dealing .
Listen , she loved her cousin Tybalt dearly , and so did I .
Then you were right on target .
And now they're both gone .
I can only repeat what I've said before .
Oh yes , you spoke , my lord , but total nonsense .
I've spelled it out for you clearly .
As God is my witness , you know you're mine .
Oh , how brave of you !
I mean please go into the house , sir .
Let the old ruffian discover that I have many other ways to die , and in the meantime , we'll laugh at his challenge .
Therefore I say again that he must have used some powerful drug or magic potion on her .
Sir , you and I must part company , no , that's not it .
But mistress , know yourself .
Everyone who does so is a traitor and should be hanged .
Come on , you're being ridiculous !
Then you should offer the gods a sacrifice to show your thanks .
What a horrible slut !
Monster , I smell like horse piss , which is making my nose pretty upset .
Poor man !
The queen drinks to your good luck and happiness , Hamlet .
Anyone who builds his hopes on air lives like a drunken sailor hanging on a mast , ready with every dizzy nod of his head to tumble to the bottom of the sea .
Thank you .
Well , I'm sorry for you , gentle Silvius .
I was the only one who refused to give back what I stole .
I'll be back soon , and if I haven't brought you anything to eat , I will give you permission to die .
If you come to me after tomorrow and say , "That's my glove , " I swear by this hand , I will take it and give you a box on the ear .
Slay !
Watch his reaction .
You mean you don't even want to hear my side ?
But tell me , monsieur , what sport are the ladies missing ?
Sir Paris , I'll make a desperate argument for my child's love .
I always pray for them
The excuse you make to delay the news is longer than the news itself .
Toward Chertsey , noble lord ?
Oh , these fools !
Yes , sir , very well , I'm here in your orchard .
I rejoice in his good fortune .
No Corin , since you're old , you can not guess , even if you were as dedicated a lover in your youth as there ever was , sighing and mooning all night long .
I never saw such a shameful act .
I swam ashore like a duck .
Any news from Genoa ?
Wicked woman , these white hairs you're pulling off my chin will come to life and accuse you of wrong-doing .
She looks like she's washing her hands .
Go on !
I'll go to him .
Near How large is his land army ?
But in this case of wooing , a child shall father his own father , if my wits don't fail me .
Oh , you stupid Moor !
No , it's dreadfully steep .
And so the Jew may lawfully claim a pound of flesh nearest the merchant's heart , to be cut off by him. , But please have mercy .
But I didn't want you to think that I'm hasty in my emotions .
Which troupe is it ?
But a lot of men have more hair than intelligence .
I can get you five hundred ropes for that price .
If you hadn't been their father , your white hair would have inspired in them only compassion .
I wish we had a signed legal contract .
I did , my lord .
He has almost finished dinner .
Excellent in fencing , I mean , sir .
Well done !
Oh God , what a heinous sinner I am , being ashamed to be my father's child !
Aren't you my father ?
What is his name ?
I like her more than I can say .
Please , who ?
If I don't answer , perhaps you'll think I'm accepting the heavy responsibility you foolishly want to impose on me .
You've won .
Break it up." Then he jumped in between them and forced them to put their swords down .
Hello , sir !
I wouldn't even pee without dancing a waltz .
I don't have anywhere to go , so I don't need to see .
If our general had been his old self , we would have won .
Never mind .
How did her eyes get so bright ?
Ask it something , Horatio .
She's well .
Yes , and more .
I couldn't go to Mantua because I was stuck there .
Damn it , shut your mouth .
You're competing for
My father's dead , and his fortune is mine now .
He's married .
Oh , I'll rest here forever .
Gloucester , it's true that we are in great danger .
Don't you know that I have offered these bones of mine for ransom ?
So you'll bring the necklace to her yourself ?
I hope to see good days , and many of them .
Well then , saint , let lips do what hands do .
Lose nothing ?
Was my father a traitor , Mother ?
It isn't daybreak yet .
There they go , Silver !
May God , who is the best matchmaker , join your hearts and realms in one .
My lord , I swear to you , Oh , don't swear !
The ground feels flat to me .
Of what
Ah , you're here ? , Come on , gentlemen , let's go !
Quiet !
Yes , I am .
Don't you care about me ?
And how would we go about doing that ?
Is that the naked guy ?
Perhaps a woman's voice may do some good when some small detail proves to be holding things up .
I want to measure the extent of your love , to see how far it stretches .
For standing up for this unpopular king .
Are you sick ?
Or are we both on drugs ?
What do you want ?
In the place where souls recline on beds of flowers we'll walk hand in hand and amaze the other ghosts with our spirited demeanor .
Yes , my lord .
He will live as a cursed man .
The weakest fruit drops to the ground first , so let me drop .
I'll have nothing to do with you .
Come on , Sir Andrew , there's nothing you can do about it .
Please , do so .
The adult snake lies in the ditch .
It's already almost night .
It's a monster !
Every heart in Rome loves and pities you .
You will be the king .
These are frightening odds .
Are you hurt , lieutenant ?
You've got it wrong , old man .
joy except my love for you , and I find that only your majesty's love makes me happy .
So you got what you deserved , and were locked up in this cave , which is more fitting for the likes of you than a prison would be .
I could even supply the dialogue between you and your lover if you did your little puppet show of love for me .
What are you going to do ?
Master , master !
Where are the noble Hastings , Rivers , Vaughan , Grey ?
I don't know about that .
I learned it in England , where they have a talent for drinking .
Buckingham , I need to have a word with you .
Kingdoms and provinces dropped from his pockets like loose change .
Nothing that you want to hear , my lord , but nothing so bad that I can't mention it .
There's something going on that's not what it seems .
I kiss his dirty shoe , and from the bottom of my heart I love the lovely boy .
My legs may be yellow , but I don't feel blue .
You should be whipping yourself , since you lust after her and yearn to do the same thing for which you're punishing her .
Oh , just see what happens after the pageantry is over !
I'm glad to see your highness .
But a lot of old people act like they're already dead , sluggish , slow , fat , and colorless , like lead .
Thank you , dear Nurse .
Listen , boy !
Because Pyramus is a good-looking man , the most handsome man that you could find on a summer's day , a lovely gentlemanly man .
My lord , my life is as important to me as yours is to you , and it was never as precious to me as it is now .
Leave out the water .
Maybe I'll never go home again , Iago !
I will pause for a reply .
But what's he like ?
Eros !
Then the dovehouse shook with the earthquake .
What are you doing , old man ?
But who's that coming this way ?
Tell her you heard us , and that she should sneak into the arbor where the crisscrossing branches overhead keep the honeysuckles out of the sun .
Make her sterile and dry up her womb so that no baby will ever come out of her body and honor her .
You can figure out the rest .
Be violent , bold , and firm .
That's enough , Dromio , please .
Then let's meet with our senior command and discuss what to do next .
It's mine , sir .
Come with me .
He says that for Brutus's sake he finds himself indebted to us all .
I've set dangerous plans in motion , using lies , drunken prophecies , and stories about dreams to set my brother Clarence and the king against each other .
And in a P.S .
Tybalt is dead , and Romeo has been banished .
Why are you chewing on your lower lip like that ?
It's true , he died on the day my sister turned thirteen .
Stand aside , Captain Gower .
Please say no more .
Good running , Thisbe !
Spirit , did you carry out the storm just as I ordered ?
I'll sue him for assault and battery , if there's any justice in Illyria .
How does he love me ?
Hamlet." Dutifully and obediently my daughter showed me this letter , and more like it .
He's fainted !
This is what happens when you visit whores .
Well then , can't I act as Rosalind for you tomorrow ?
In Spain , Caesar had a fever , and it made him shake .
Loss upon loss !
Please , Emilia , ask Cassio where he was at dinner tonight. ,
Mistress , you know about that .
Clarence has arrived , lying , cowardly I'm not surprised it scared you , my lord .
Don't be silly !
I am ashamed that women are so foolish as to declare war when they should plead on their knees for peace , that they seek authority , supremacy , and power when they are under an obligation to serve , love , and obey .
Oh , spite of spites !
Don't be afraid of greatness." That was well written .
I will sit here in the middle .
I feel I should recognize you and that man
Give me the letter .
My lord , I won't miss it .
Let's go .
Come inside with me , and I will tell you my plan .
I like your new wig and headdress , though I'd like it more if the hair were a shade browner .
But there is no end , absolutely none , to my sexual desires .
I remember , Adam , that's Here comes my master , your brother .
No one passing by ?
Please , Signior Gremio .
Thank you .
Treason !
Damn you all !
Why did I just send you home ?
Yes , sir .
Now let the wind blow , waves swell , and ships sink !
Today , great duke , she locked me out of my house and feasted there with whores .
Then you told a lie , a sick , wicked lie .
My lord !
So how did it go , sir ?
I won't allow it .
You'll never see me again , whether or not he's dead .
I'll be your wife if you'll have me .
I'll go to Ireland .
Good idea .
But before we reached the end point , Caesar cried , "Help me , Cassius , or I will sink ! " And just as Aeneas , the hero who founded Rome , emerged from the fires of Troy with his elderly father Anchises on his shoulder , so I emerged from the Tiber carrying the tired Caesar .
He swears he used to be a courtier .
Give me your hand .
When Jacob took care of his uncle Laban's sheep , Jacob was the heir to his grandfather Abraham's birthright , because his mother cleverly arranged for her husband Isaac to make Jacob his heir , What's your point ?
Oh , that devious Egyptian spirit !
It takes a wise father to know his own child .
I won't deny you anything !
I'll say good-bye now .
That's good .
Well , may peace be with you .
Healing is part and parcel of my religious vows ; it is a charitable duty my order performs .
Yes , sir , he's here at the door right now and asks to see you .
Give me your hand .
I remember your eyes quite well .
What's that sound ?
Don't spoil the justness and virtue of our endeavor nor weaken our own irrepressible spirits by thinking that we need a binding oath , when the blood that every noble Roman contains within him would be proven bastard's blood if he broke the smallest part of any promise he had made .
Romeo !
At Pembroke , or at Harfordwest in Wales .
Welcome , good Cambio .
What symptoms , my lord ?
Well , good luck to them tonight in bed !
Sir , it's a troupe of actors who want to perform for your Lordship .
I'm here .
If I don't love her , I'm completely
If we flee from the boar before the boar even pursues us , we'll only make the boar angry and suspicious , causing him to chase us when he never intended to .
It's better to act virtuously rather than vengefully .
If you still feel so affectionate toward her , then why not give her permission to cheat on you ?
I wasn't born to die on your sword .
Yes it is , you half-blood .
Speak , my fair one , and speak fairly , I beg you .
We hope you feel better and find some peace .
It's a shame that you walk the streets with all the honest men .
If Fulvia were the last woman on earth , there would be a reason to grieve .
Well then , I'll do it .
But fortune could not reward me better than to let me die well , without owing my master anything .
Sometimes the love my subjects bring me is inconvenient , but I still accept it as love .
So take her , shepherd , and God bless you .
When asked the Duke and Duchess of Cornwall if I could take pity on the king and shelter him from the storm , they took my house away from me and ordered me never to talk about him , lobby for him , or support him in any way .
Then pack up your instruments and go away .
So young , my lord , and honest .
We know how much they suffer if we are unkind to them .
If you wish .
I'll take a look at your letter .
Wait , sweet Beatrice .
If Duncan bleeds I'll paint the servants ' faces with his blood .
Now , Roderigo , where did you see her ? , Oh , that miserable wretch ! , You say you saw her with the Moor ? , Oh , who would want to be a father ? , How did you know it was her ? , To think she tricked me so easily ! , What did she say to you ? , Get me more candles , and wake up all my relatives .
Why , that man is a total fraud and rascal .
What's going on , daughter ?
You're too bitter .
The armies were like two exhausted swimmers clinging to each other and struggling in the water , unable to move .
I'm going to find some shade and sigh until he returns .
A faithful shepherd worships you .
When you free your children from the sword , your grandchildren will repay you in your old age .
So I die with a kiss .
Actors can't keep a secret .
Yes , why shouldn't she ?
But despite all this , your daughters will give you a lot of money , or do I mean pain ? , in the coming year .
Yes , even if I had whole kingdoms to give along with her .
Go and get our stuff onto the ship .
I had no reason , no reason .
With the permission of Brutus and the others , for Brutus is an honorable man ; they are all honorable men , I have come here to speak at Caesar's funeral .
It's time for us to stand guard .
Forgive me , your grace .
Sir , sir !
It was a bit short , my lord .
How many , can you guess ?
Please keep in mind we're only here out of spite .
What would you like , Laertes ?
Yes , revered Queen .
One of the sisters poisoned the other out of love for me , and then killed herself .
I beg you , Strato , stay by me .
This toast is for Lepidus !
From now on , goodness in women , not superficial beauty , will win my heart .
A snake did do it , because no snake ever had a more forked , lying tongue than you have .
Won't he join us ?
Sir , let's get to the point .
Why , then , it's my body's doomsday .
Sir Toby , I've got to be frank with you .
What an idiot that monster is !
Informed them" ?
First you taught me how to beg , and now I think you're teaching me how a beggar should be answered .
We're searching on land , but he's lost in the sea .
Menas , I'm not going back on shore .
Some good friend of his must have died , because nothing else in the world could change a man so much .
What are we going to do , Enobarbus ?
Come shake hands with Laertes , Hamlet .
Just to the Tower , I'm guessing , for the same reason you are : to salute the noble princes who are staying there .
He taught me how to recognize a man in love , and you're not a prisoner of love , I'm sure .
Our tolerance for slavery and oppression shows us to be weak , like women .
I knew that would be your answer .
Did this happen before the King of France returned home ?
That's uncivilized and unnatural !
I don't want anything but that .
Listen to many people , but talk to few .
She can't possibly have done you any wrong .
Was it mine ?
If what you feel is really love , tell me how much .
You've seen these illusions .
Do you carry a pike ?
Oh , my brave Emperor , this is what I call a fight !
Drive it out of you .
He doesn't miss a thing .
We can't go on with this plan .
Please go to him , my friend .
It'll go away .
You mustn't hold my earlier outburst against me .
Answer when I call your name. , Nick Bottom , the weaver ?
Check and see if he's breathing .
Caesar's sister is named Octavia .
Oh , damn her , damn her !
Good food's not a big deal , everyone can afford that .
Let's see , how can I
Royal Egypt , Empress !
If she returns my jewels , I'll stop pursuing her and apologize to her .
Lovely Beatrice , I thank you for taking the pains to tell me that .
Their bodies may remain here in England , but their hearts are encamped on the fields of France already .
Oh , with his sordid desertion , he sets the example for our own .
But Miranda is so much more beautiful , you can't even compare the two .
That's how Claudio will respond .
I have it ready .
My eyes were liars , then , because I never saw true beauty before tonight .
No one except her maid and a holy hermit .
Not that I know of .
Halt .
Well , let's hope you stay in that noble frame of mind .
I'll do it even if I find you in the company of the king himself .
No , by Our Lady , I'm not such a fool to think what I please , and I don't please to think what I can , and in fact I can not think , even if I could think my heart right past thinking , that you are in love or that you will be in love or even that you can be in love .
We'll burn his body in the holy place and use the brands to set the traitors ' houses on fire .
Banquo and Donalbain , Malcolm !
I also hope that we can be better strangers .
You mean their Cut off their heads , take their maidenheads , whatever .
Death is my heir .
Go on ahead .
Come , my sweet Kate .
God bless your Grace with health and happy days .
Oh , rude and unthankful boy !
Is that his answer ?
Into God's hands .
The ground is brown .
Oh , for God's sake .
I want this to provoke confrontations , so I can give him a piece of my mind .
The king loves you very much .
I am willing to fight you if I must .
Tell him I've spoken to my husband on his behalf , and I think everything will be all right .
Fool , I say !
But excuse me , Yes , I'm talking about Launcelot , sir .
The three of you have killed a sweet , innocent woman .
I don't mean he's
It hangs like an old worn-out mop .
A thing of no importance .
And would I have ever done that to you ?
Which is either a fool or a nothing .
Now go ahead and tell me the rest of your story. , Please go stand farther away .
How are you , Charmian ?
Shut the doors after you .
Lord , it's glancing every which way !
Please , uncle , let's go in and ask your daughters to forgive you .
Why are you telling me this ?
My meaning And I
He has , my lord .
Pretend that you're standing on the shore , watching a city dance on the shifting waves , and you'll have an idea of the look of this majestic fleet as it holds a straight course for Harfleur .
A husband ?
Stay right here and try to look good .
I dreamed the souls of the people Richard murdered came to my tent and promised me victory .
Don't I deserve more than this ?
Everything is a sick joke .
And he would have deserved it too .
A backbiting friend , one who grabs people , who patrols the streets and passageways .
I pulled it from his wound .
Fool , I'll repay you for this favor .
You're bothering me .
Here comes the noble Antony .
Maybe , but you're wrinkled all the same .
Live , live !
Now I'll tell you the other story about my journey .
I have to tell you everything .
Getting right to the point , I live near the Capitol .
This precious little guy is putty in your hands , Sir Toby .
You do your job well .
No , it's not as deep as a well , or as wide as a church door , but it's enough .
Ha !
What woman's servant ?
The wind is filling your ship's sail , and they're waiting for you .
Bring your master home .
What is the matter ?
I'll write a letter challenging him to a duel on your behalf .
An hour before you pulled me out of the breaking waves , my sister drowned .
But when you are with him , your angel is weakened and easily frightened .
That day will never come .
Ride , ride , Messala .
Who's sleeping in the second chamber ?
Cassio was attacked here in the dark by Roderigo and men who escaped .
That's the way to show me friendship .
Only an hour ago it was nine , and in another hour it will be eleven .
And a bad singer , my lord .
But here's an old , true saying : "If you want to win France , start with Scotland." For when the eagle England leaves her nest to seek prey , the weasel Scot always comes sneaking around to suck dry her princely eggs and , like the mouse when the cat's away , destroy more than she can actually eat .
What's that good for ?
Do you want to destroy our old friendship by joining these men to insult your poor friend ?
Young boys and girls are equal to men .
Why , she challenges me like a Muslim would challenge a Christian .
You are in a perilous state , shepherd .
Kill Claudio .
Let this anger sharpen your sword .
Though I said my name was Benedick , I heard this news with Claudio's ears .
No , it would be impossible .
God , I'm crazy about her .
Don't delay , Caesar .
Dear God , thank you !
What , like stuff from a house ?
My mistress and her sister are waiting for you .
His father , if I do say so myself , is an honest but very poor man , and , thank God , likely to live a long time .
It's good we had this meeting .
This week he was sad , moody , and depressed and very different from his usual self .
Yes , my lord .
You , my slave , were her servant at the time , as you admit yourself .
Pay for something I never got ?
Will you be here when I return ?
That's a deal .
She's busy and can not come ! " Is that an answer ?
Signor Lodovico ?
This isn't a monster , it's a devil .
In that case , I ask that for the sake of friendship and alliance you let that one item stand with the rest , and bestow your daughter on me .
If you shut the windows , it will pour out the keyhole .
I'll give him equal thanks , so we're even .
God bless my old master .
I don't feel any urge to see a more handsome man than this one .
You mean a devil !
If you'd known how much that ring meant , how much the woman who gave it to you is worth , or how much your honor depended on your keeping the ring , you wouldn't have let it go .
But I promise it can be cured with some guidance .
It is .
Now , Iras , what do you think ?
Speak , man , what's the matter ?
Let me sit down .
Oh , you're just going to talk about banishment again .
I'm very glad to see you .
Did you see anything ?
Let him hoist you up in front of the shouting crowds !
Is Signior Lucentio at home , sir ?
What do you mean , your highness ?
Accursed , unhappy , wretched , hateful day !
He tried to kill me recently , very recently .
You should have run up to her , unleashed a few excellent quips invented on the spot , and rendered the young man speechless .
He hadn't arrived by the time we finished eating , so I went out looking for him .
If you see anything else , let me know .
I'll wait for her here and when she comes I'll take a novel approach with her .
My Lord of Norfolk , Here , most gracious king .
Take a little vacation in Mantua .
Do you think you've won ?
What can I tell you ?
They're calling for dates and quinces in the pastry kitchen .
Tell me , good grandmother , is our father dead ?
While he and I are at one , my loyal servant Catesby will be at the other , so nothing will happen that we won't find out about .
He's killed his wife !
Beware of March 15th .
Two great enemies , in fact , enemies to my peace of mind .
I'll invite the duke and all of his followers .
I hope it works out for the best , Lepidus .
Did you think I was talking about sex ?
Quiet !
Give me my armor .
I wish I could keep killing him for nine years straight .
And now you cry , even though she has risen up above the clouds , as high as heaven itself ?
Isn't that what they said ?
I was told that by one who knows him better than you .
Hamlet , you're dead .
But life itself , my wife , and the whole world aren't more valuable to me than your life is .
And Madam , with all my heart .
I'll be back here with you by two o'clock .
But major issues must come before minor ones .
When they see the face of Caesar , they will vanish .
Banquo , if your soul is going to make it to heaven , tonight's the night .
I ask you , if you have a grudge against me , to kill me now , while your stained hands still reek of blood .
Tell us about this wrestling .
I'm ashamed that I yielded to them .
As a child , he took such a long time to grow up that , according to his rule , he should have grown up into a gracious adult .
Come , blade , drench my breast with blood .
Oh , control yourself , lady !
Let quick sulfurous lightning , strong enough to split enormous trees , singe the white hair on my head .
If you take more or less than exactly a pound , even if it's just the tiniest fraction of an ounce , if the scale changes by even so much as a hair , you die , and all your property will be confiscated .
Keep me in your thoughts and go comfort your cousin .
What's wrong ?
They got what they deserved .
By the future .
If it looks like my good father , I'll speak to it , even if Hell itself opens up and tells me to be quiet .
Why did I come here if not for that ?
He's been in an unusually good mood and has granted many gifts to your household and servants .
I like singing .
Then I guess the whole world is one .
Write to me very soon and I'll let you know what she thinks .
Right now we're shaken up by fears and doubts .
Every hour he comes out with some horrible new offense that puts us all on edge .
Which is the lady I'm supposed to marry ?
Launcelot , what's going on ?
Catesby .
Believe me , my friend , since I have the power to stop the prosecutors .
So I'll be forced to call you a jerk , Sir Andrew .
Actually , once or twice she sighed and said , "father , " as if the word were pressing on her chest .
But have you put the love juice from the flower on the eyes of that Athenian , as I asked you to do ?
I'll have my head cut from my shoulders before I'll see the crown so misplaced .
Suffolk died first , and York , cut to pieces , came to him where he lay in his blood and took him by the face , kissing his gashes .
This is your job .
Well , if it wasn't her , I don't know .
On my knee , I humbly ask your blessing .
Round enough to be unattractive .
Good Lord , how bright and splendid is the moon tonight !
And do you see how much your foolish wife means to him ?
Get out of my sight !
Hello , sweet lady .
Now all is for nothing .
Don't you have one word of joy ?
But sir , Be quiet , Kent .
Hardly , Kate .
I've got no hope that he survived .
He's walking over there , sir .
Why should he have followed you ?
Sir , don't even try to beat me in a battle of wits .
Get to the point now .
For the favor of sleeping in her bed .
That's because you are near me , and you're as dazzling as the sun .
I will .
At Friar Lawrence's cell she can make confession and be married .
What you told me it haunts me like a nightmare , he's got my handkerchief !
No , instead I'll go to Benedick and advise him to fight his emotions .
No , I found it and gave it to my husband .
Don't do it with poison .
No , I don't want to send your soul to hell when I kill you .
I'll be back soon to wake up your generosity .
What I'm saying is , your jealousy has pushed your husband away from his sanity .
Don't listen to him , Emilia , even though he's your husband .
Maybe the king is sending you to the Tower to have you renamed .
We're not going to run in our army , Monsieur Monster .
I will not be faced or bested .
It doesn't make either of us happy , I know .
Go , Pindarus , climb a little higher on this hill .
Cleopatra , How could I have ever thought that you would be faithful and true , even though your vows of love shook the heavens themselves , you , who were unfaithful to Fulvia ?
Look , sir , I'm bleeding .
What can possibly fix this situation ?
And do you mean what you're saying , Gratiano ?
Arm yourself .
I'm not sad , my lord .
My friends , remember that you're my guests here .
And you have to cut this flesh from his chest .
Don't think I'm so dumb that I don't know that the devil himself won't eat a woman .
It's yours , and you may hang us , your trophies of war , anywhere you like .
Good morning , Caesar .
Leonato , am I standing here ?
I think she's the most wonderful woman I've ever laid eyes on .
Come , tailor , show it to us .
The tiring journey seems to have made you gloomy .
Is it possible Fulvia is dead ?
But what am I afraid of ?
Since if the sun breeds maggots on a dead dog , kissing the corpse , by the way , do you have a daughter ?
Or else love is blind , and its best time is the night .
But he kept chattering so foolishly , talking about you in such insulting and despicable terms , that it was hard for me to restrain myself .
That was too much .
Send me away , my lord , but don't kill me !
Don't let the Danish king's bed be a nest of incest .
Will you have me ?
We , now at our largest , can only decrease .
You've probably heard about the "change" that's come over Hamlet , that's the only word for it , since inside and out he's different from what he was before .
You keep cramming words into my ears that I don't want to hear .
Who can command the forest and make the trees pull their roots out of the earth ?
Yes , making a big fuss .
Please , leave it here .
There was no story , my lord .
Yes , I forgot , three months .
Are you going to write Antony about this ?
Yes , yes , Curtis , so hurry up and start the fire .
Signor Antonio , you've often insulted my money and my business practices in the Rialto .
And it's good to have joy in such a joyless time .
What can I do for you , madam ?
Very good , sir .
Oh , horror , horror , horror !
Down with the Montagues !
They're entirely welcome .
I believe I have some choice in the matter , sir .
Call Cleopatra what the Romans call her .
I guess this is not a fish , but a native who got struck by lightning just now .
I need to speak a word with you .
Quick , let's hide , my lord .
Some French agents are already at work in our main ports and are on the verge of declaring open war .
They all fell asleep together , as if they'd planned it .
Wasn't that Cassio leaving my wife ?
It's like a cockleshell or a walnut shell , a joke , a prank , a doll's cap .
You're not thinking of leaving tonight , surely ?
My leg's been cut in two .
I would rip his heart out in public and eat it .
Tell us , Othello .
You too .
What would you have said , my young York ?
He's not your relative .
Oh , ceremony , only show me your value !
Come , husband , let's go to lunch .
I don't doubt your wisdom .
Oh , you're a clergyman ?
That's how someone who's been murdered should look , and that's how I look .
It's not quite that simple .
I'm determined to be heard by someone .
Ah , Juliet if you're as happy as I am , and you're better with words , tell me about the happiness you imagine we'll have in our marriage .
As for myself , it was Greek to me .
This madman will murder me .
I will go find him .
If he will grant me conquered Egypt , so that I may give it to my son , I will kneel to him with thanks .
No , it heals gradually .
If he can keep it , he'll be set forever .
My daughter told me everything .
I pity your situation .
Don't ask me to talk about it .
Come on .
Death is the best way to cover over her shame .
Wait !
I curse him , but he loves me .
While you were dazed by grief , which isn't appropriate for a man like you , Cassio showed up here .
Just as I did with the meat , I'll make up some problem with the way the bed is made , and throw the pillow one way and the cushion the other , and the blanket over here and the sheets over there .
His father was Philip of Macedon , as I remember .
I tell you , there are good men born at Monmouth .
And so , good Capulet , which is a name I love like my own name , you should be satisfied with what I say .
Won't King Richard let me speak with him ?
Indeed , before you arrived here , old Siward , with ten thousand soldiers already prepared for battle , was making his way here .
Go lodge a complaint about this with the duke .
Take comfort .
Here it is , I think .
Put on your nightgown .
I haven't seen him recently .
My cousin means Signior Benedick of Padua .
To hell with this idiot !
I think this night is just like sick daylight .
Order them to escape .
Come now , keep your oath .
Have all your conquests , glories , triumphs , achievements , come to so little ?
This is the time of night when witches come out , when graveyards yawn open and the stench of hell seeps out .
I definitely will .
Tybalt wanted to kill you , but you killed Tybalt .
You don't have a man's courage .
If you stick with me , when the time comes , there will be something in it for you .
It's not right to obey his orders to let him go alone .
Finally , after shaking my arm a little , and jerking his head up and down three times , he sighed like it was his last breath .
If you say that , you bastard , you'll kill your Queen .
Have Montjoy hurry , then , Lord Constable , and have him ask the king of England what he is willing to pay us to get out of the war .
She always has to have a light next to her .
Goblin , lead them up and down .
It's doubly wrong to cheat on your wife and then let her see the offense in your eyes .
Aren't these woods less perilous than the court , with all its jealousies and intrigues ?
Be quick about it .
No , not at all .
Congratulations , lady : you resemble a most honorable man .
You speak so highly of fools !
My good qualities , my legal status as Desdemona's husband , and my innocence will protect me .
Well put , Maecenas .
The services I have done for the Venetian government will count for more than his complaints will .
I think so too .
My name is Mary , sir .
Can't he pay back the money ?
Ranting and raving to my own shadow !
That's me , sir .
I'm not Lear .
His knights are getting out of control , and he himself reprimands us about every little detail .
You're my lieutenant now .
Show them in .
What I'm saying can't anger him .
Get out , you horrible bastard , or I'll gouge out your eyes .
Take this , too .
Goodness , it's daylight .
I could be sad if I wanted to be .
There are more than enough willing women around .
That's unbelievably bad .
I wish this trick would be over .
Do as I asked you .
Who are you ?
How did you divide yourself in two ?
I see that you are poor .
I don't want to take another man's second-hand goods .
These child actors are now in fashion , and they've so overtaken the public theaters that society types hardly come at all , they're so afraid of being mocked by the playwrights who write for the boys .
Or are you just pretending ?
I have the best armor in the world .
Conscience , " I say , "you give good advice." "Devil , " I say , "you give good advice." If I listened to my conscience , I'd stay with the Jew my master , who's a devil .
I wish I were senseless , sir , so that I wouldn't feel your punches !
I can't sleep quietly in the Tower .
Then have your servants bring him out .
Well , it must have been Signior Benedick .
Here comes the Duke now .
Of course , sir .
I am a villain .
Since you are a lying hypocrite , we must look after you .
Sir , the person who should sing that song isn't here .
Just obey me a little bit longer .
I still have room for six more wounds .
He does indeed show sparks of something like wit .
Is he here ?
You're torturing me , Tubal .
I know him to be valiant .
Though I wish you were dead , I'm not going to be the one to kill you .
Aren't you Romeo ?
Holy Saint Francis , this is a drastic change !
The king's son , Ferdinand , with his hair standing straight up , it looked like reeds , not hair , was the first person to jump , shouting , "Hell is empty , and all the devils are here ! " Good job !
Here , sir !
I'll follow in the center of the troop formation , which I'll defend with my best horse , and with Saint George on my side , as well !
Give me the goblets .
Most royal sir , Fleance has escaped .
Your threats are no stronger than her whining. , Helena , I love you .
Why did he do that ?
The moon's bright tonight .
She weeps for Edward and so do I , while she does not weep for Clarence , though I do .
Not if you go away , there isn't .
If he isn't what he might be , then I wish to God he were !
Oh no , not if you say it right .
We don't come here with the intention of making you happy .
Let him thank me , who helped him get there .
It's true , that wasn't such a nice thing to do .
Oh , I'm dead !
So then , you must think that hairy men are honest and simpleminded .
I want all such offenders to be dealt with that way , and I give precise orders that in our progress through the country there shall be nothing seized from the villages , nothing taken that is not paid for , none of the French harassed or abused in disrespectful language .
I came from Corinth , Your Highness .
You foolish madman , listen to me for a moment .
Love can make worthless things beautiful .
As for myself , I didn't dare laugh , for fear of opening my lips and inhaling the stinking air .
Are you going to join them ?
Sometimes the expression on her face tells me she likes me .
Caesar greets the Queen of Egypt and asks that you consider what you will ask from him .
Have you had lunch yet ?
Not even trivial things were left out .
I swear to you by my virginity at age twelve , I already told her to come .
A pretty pathetic monster .
But if I were smart enough to get out of this forest , I'd be wise enough to satisfy myself .
If every time you wished for a child you could have had one , you would have a million children .
I'm smart enough to find the logs myself without bothering Peter .
Follow me .
Let's send this news to Rome .
I'd rather be a toad in a moldy basement than to have only a part of someone I love , sharing the rest of her with others .
You inhuman dog !
All hail , Macbeth !
Well then , I know who you are .
Come on , let's put him in a dark room and tie him up .
Is it feasible ?
Bring me the handkerchief , My mind is full of doubt .
The next day I explained all this to him , which was as good as begging his pardon .
It's entirely possible .
She has disarmed me .
Even though she's as similar to Goneril as one crabapple is like another , still, I know what I know .
I have to go .
What would you like me to do at Salisbury ?
Don't run away , stay where you are .
You're under arrest , sir .
I'm just worried that you've been cozying up to her , and gotten intimate with her .
Let me be put to death .
If any ships are sailing , I'll get right on one .
May good fortune come to you , good Petruchio !
Cowards die many times before their deaths .
Have you seen my lord ?
We told him we wouldn't even let him bury his men until he retreated to Saint Colme's Inch and paid us ten thousand dollars .
So tell me , Grumio , how goes the world ?
Her eyes are like April : full of showers .
Look , how she blushes like a virgin !
How can Caesar be a tyrant then ?
Tell us about the letters that you got from France .
I'll rest now .
It's true .
He and his daughter are captured .
Antony's wife should have an army to escort her , with neighing horses to announce her arrival long before she appears .
Your mother sends her blessings .
What stunning , exquisite , and unmatchable beauty , but please , tell me if you're the lady of the house , because I've never seen her .
Let it stay in your inventory until it bankrupts you .
As we were trading blows , more and more people showed up to join the fight , until the Prince came and broke everyone up .
My lord ?
That word "judgment" makes me feel a bit guilty .
What a storm !
Very pale , sir .
I will have to go on a journey to death soon , sir .
Please don't , sir .
I never , oh , what a mistake ! , revealed myself to him until half an hour ago , when I was in my armor .
How are you , Hero ?
Come , shall we hunt some deer for dinner ?
I don't know who had him arrested , but the man that arrested him was in a suit of leather .
If I were king ?
But suppose I did all the things you named out of love for her .
One voice speaks well and talks about his friend .
Help !
Did heaven watch the slaughter and not send down any help ?
Not that we love words more than fighting , like you do .
Is Caesar visiting the Capitol tomorrow ?
I'm sure you both remember me .
You speak like a very thankful and respectful boy , and may God bless you .
I'll be damned if the duke wouldn't have given him six pence a day for playing Pyramus .
Madam , Count Orsino's young messenger has returned .
Really , young men , though it wasn't a very hard song to get right , the music was still all out of tune .
Tell him I am ready to lay my crown at his feet and kneel before him .
Close , soft eyes .
I had a dream last night .
She's been dead for some time .
By Jesus , I think they will blow up everything if we don't improve our tactics .
If I break the door down , slave , you'll be sorry for this .
Come on , give me your best shot .
I beg you to continue to be patient .
We seemed to have two separate bodies , but we had one heart .
Tell her .
How smooth and cool they seem !
Have her send it to me .
They have fully sixty thousand fighting men .
Hey , love , I say !
If there's any way I can spoil his life , I'll be overjoyed .
Is he angry ?
What do you need me to do ?
Mine , neither .
Once again you bring good news .
If this letter falls into your hands , think carefully about what it says .
I'm afraid that I wrong the honorable men whose daggers have stabbed Caesar .
The less they deserve , the more your generosity is worth .
It's revolting !
I swear to you , I don't want to be doing this .
As far as I know , he's okay and will arrive here soon .
Cassius , don't take it badly .
You're a fool .
Your death and destiny advise your followers to escape .
Go , go , good countrymen , and to make up for having done wrong , gather up all the poor men like yourselves , lead them to the Tiber , and weep into the river until it overflows its banks .
And hello to you , fair sister .
March to the bridge .
Say , what's the trouble ?
You could not prevent her from dying someday , but heaven will give her eternal life .
I'll return the favor .
The same people who say he gets drunk with you every night .
What do you have to say for yourself , Hermia ?
How am I unfaithful ?
She'll be here soon , just like her letter said .
I am not treacherous .
The king isn't the one sending you to the Tower , Clarence .
I think you're more articulate .
Here comes the Emperor .
Away !
Oh , you wicked scoundrel !
But then again he's never really understood his own feelings very well .
I showed it to you once .
If you married my sister for her wealth , then for her wealth's sake , treat her with more kindness .
But soon I'll see the gods punish you for your lack of respect to your father .
You will never be able to say the same about me .
If that's not the case , then this must be the answer : You , Romeo , have not been to bed tonight .
And yet you say that exile is not death ?
What do you want with her , sir ?
Lord Alexas , sweet Alexas , most anything Alexas , almost the most consummate Alexas , where's the fortuneteller you recommended so highly to the Queen ?
Did the brothers-in-law leave ?
Where have you been hiding ?
Oh , how I love you !
Gouge out his eyes !
The fractured world , in its confusion , should send lions into the city streets and humans into the wilderness to live in lions' dens .
All to our advantage .
I loved wine and gambling , and had more women than a Turkish sultan keeps in his harem .
Goddammit !
There isn't a single drop of sincerity in him that could be touched with love .
I'll walk up and down and sing a song , so they'll know I'm not afraid .
He who is dizzy thinks the world is spinning .
Don't think about her .
But tell me this : don't you know my voice ?
My dear fool , because my brother died .
I'm bleeding , but you didn't kill me .
And you're right to do so .
The three who share the known world are aboard your boat .
But be quiet , here comes Thisbe .
Sometimes you get a bit too wild , and you let your voice get a bit loud and rude .
Check the calendar and come tell me .
The laws of Venice state that if a foreign resident directly or indirectly attempts to kill any citizen , the person he tried to kill will receive one half of the foreigner's goods .
Oh , wait , sir .
I hope you're not drowned .
Stay close by when we wake him up , ma'am .
Though that must have been a pitiful sight , the ground looked beautiful .
It's your job in life to kill the innocent ?
I'd be just as happy if you broke his neck as his finger .
No , taking you away from your new marriage would be like showing a child a new coat and then not letting him wear it .
It probably has something to do with, I don't know .
Who doesn't know he's dead ?
Maybe ?
No , Cassius , no .
Here it is .
If I stay longer , I'll embarrass you and disgrace myself by crying .
Yes .
That's all I want , and I'll do anything to accomplish it .
Now that the wind is favorable , let's board the ship .
For God's sake , would someone bring me a mug of beer !
Which of you does not tremble when you see me ?
Strange and terrible events are all welcome , but I despise comforts .
Be calm !
Yes , that's quite likely .
I don't want to kill you before you've readied your soul .
I see that you are here , but I'd like you to go there and then come back again .
Now the inconstant moon has nothing to do with me .
Pardon me , lords and gentlemen who stayed awake .
I fear that your words and your heart are both false .
Brutus , my lord .
I have no doubt he got ashore alive .
The only kind of tears you should shed in this case are the kind you might get from holding an onion to your nose .
Fierce , fiery warriors fought in the clouds in the usual formations of war , ranks and squadrons , until the clouds drizzled blood onto the Capitol .
I'm not in a joking mood .
What , my good lord ?
He's very serious , which is right for someone in mourning like me .
I pardon that man .
Take it away .
Orlando ?
I will , my lord .
I folded up the new document , signed it , sealed it , and put it safely back so that no one noticed any difference .
It's him !
I've got her now , but I've got God to thank for it !
He's going to look like a total idiot .
Richard is looking cheerful today .
Many people have told me so .
Is your name Shylock ?
His highness is not well .
Heaven knows I am .
Halt !
Goodbye , then .
Whether it's even or odd , of all the days in the year , on the night of Lammas Eve , she'll be fourteen .
We'll leave tonight and be home a day before our husbands get back .
Should I perjure my soul by disobeying it ?
When we're by ourselves you can call me "Tranio." Everywhere else , address me as your master Lucentio .
Yes , you've been a ladies ' man in your time .
But I won't leave this spot , no matter what they do .
She herself is as valuable as any dowry could ever be .
Hurry .
In the beautiful city of Verona , where our story takes place , a long-standing hatred between two families erupts into new violence , and citizens stain their hands with the blood of their fellow citizens .
I have nothing to say to you .
What's the matter , lieutenant ?
Most noble brother , you have done me wrong .
I saw a thousand shipwrecks , a thousand men whom fish had gnawed to the bone , huge anchors , chunks of gold , heaps of pearls , and precious jewels , all scattered on the bottom of the sea .
Four o'clock in the morning .
If he doesn't show up , the play is ruined .
I've lost so much weight worrying about my losses have that I'll hardly have a pound of flesh to spare for my bloody creditor tomorrow. , Well , jailer , let's go. , I hope to God that Bassanio comes to see me pay his debt .
At least I don't have a horse for my mistress , or a saying so beside the point .
Is love really tender ?
What's your message ?
They let God see things they wouldn't show their husbands .
They're coming .
Your face is mine , and you have slandered it .
Poor Antony !
He discovered that the man was his older brother .
I feel awful for my cousin .
I order you , speak !
You call this house dark ?
Why would you be so foolish as to beat the moody duke's favorite champion ?
Doesn't that make you want to cry ?
Quiet , quiet !
Monday !
Are these the wretches that we threw dice for ?
It's not true .
Oh ho , is that what you're getting at ?
Whatever I say , or think , or do , you're continually contradicting it .
Be happy .
Calm down , Kate .
The air is sweet and appeals to my refined senses .
Lord Hastings , you and he are close .
You were sent for .
Gracious King Edward has sent us noble Siward and ten thousand soldiers .
And to hell with drowning yourself !
And I understand perfectly his sneering reference to my wilder days .
Captain Fluellen !
No flattery for him , no sir !
Well , then , what are you messing up ?
If not , it's true , this parting was well done .
She would make a good wife for Benedick .
I'll always be loyal to you , sir .
What do you say now ?
No , Romeo will respond to the letter's writer , telling him whether he accepts the challenge .
Signor Montano , your brave and loyal servant , gives you this information and asks you to send reinforcements to relieve him .
Why do you pity him ?
I invite you all aboard my ship .
Yes , the duke of Buckingham and I have just returned from visiting him .
Good day and happiness to you , darling Rosalind .
If they march along unopposed , I will sell my dukedom for a sodden , filthy farm in that craggy isle of Albion .
True , if a fool such as yourself could find it .
Either Charles or some prettier thing has mastered you .
The Dauphin really wants it to be morning .
Please , keep it to yourself .
I think his soul's in hell , my lady .
Your eyes look threatening .
Are you planning to go out ?
I'll stay , my lord .
And no man with a reputation will tarnish that name with lies and bad behavior .
Today Pompey laughs away his fortune .
He's my prisoner and you can't have him .
Your lily-white lips , your cherry-red nose , and your buttercup-yellow cheeks are gone , gone forever .
If you can shape up , you're welcome to stay in the house .
Who's winning ?
I'm very afraid of Banquo .
Oh friendly friar !
Did you kill him , then ?
I'll do it , sir .
If we don't , it'll be the biggest disappointment of our lives .
What's the matter ?
You've already stained our sheets with your lust ; now I'll stain them with your whore's blood .
Please , dear , calm down .
The noise they're making will wake up Demetrius .
Didn't you go to her for a purse full of ducats ?
I took good care of you , piece of filth that you are , and let you stay in my own hut until you tried to rape my daughter .
Why , you silly man !
No braver than this ?
Here's more news .
If you were king , we would do the same .
I suspect his friends will join us .
He couldn't see you .
There's your boyfriend , sleeping right over there .
So pardon him , dear father , for my sake .
You are welcome here , as are all of you English princes .
Eat your dinner and pay no attention to him .
But love gives them power , and time gives them the chance to meet , sweetening the extreme danger with intense pleasure .
Why are you mumbling to yourself instead of answering the order I gave you ?
Here comes better news .
I would have met you by sea and again by land .
And didn't I finally arrive to comfort you ?
Help me , angels !
You have ruined my innocent child .
I put it in the pocket of my nightgown .
Besides , he's young and handsome , and he's got all the qualities that naive and silly girls go for .
You're right .
It would be a pretty stingy love if it could be counted and calculated .
I'm glad you're insane enough to admit it in front of me .
Goodbye .
Because my name is George .
Your threats don't scare me , Cassius , because I'm so secure in my honesty and integrity that they pass me by like a weak breeze .
Oh , Corin , I wish you could understand how much I love her !
I'll forbid all ships from leaving our harbors .
And that's how I'll turn her good intentions into a big trap to snag them all .
As sure as I'm standing here , I saw him .
Remember what I've told you .
I am sure , sweet Kate , this kindness deserves thanks .
No , Cassio wasn't killed .
What does Lord Stanley say ?
When you've finished , you'll be a happy man .
Get into your cold beds and warm yourselves up .
Tell me to run , and I'll run .
He recognizes me like a blind man recognizes a cuckoo , by its bad voice .
He has come to kill my heart .
Our celebratory hymns will change to sad funeral marches .
We are used to winning by standing on the earth and fighting toe to toe .
The gods are fair , and they use our little vices to punish us .
Six pence a day would've been forced on him .
Taurus !
Kill him rather than let him leave this room .
Then he pulled a watch from his bag and , looking at it solemnly , said , "It's ten o'clock .
You can't mean it , Tranio !
The things men do daily , not knowing what they're doing !
I have a daughter .
People don't cry when they're mocking someone .
Though the last time I saw him it was black from the smoke of war .
Come , come , let's remember why we're here .
What's going on , Juliet ?
Are you educated ?
And although we're giving these honors to this man so that he shares some of the blame for what we're doing , he'll carry these honors like a jackass carries gold , groaning and sweating under the load , either led or pushed , as we direct him .
Don't greet your bride in these disgraceful clothes .
To Dover .
Make these men work .
A person can only pay with their life once , and she has paid in full .
Let me refer to a proverb that may help you forgive these lovers : if you can't change something , don't cry about it .
I held the sword and he ran on it .
He carries a third of the world .
Goodbye , boy .
You can't force me any more than Hermia can beg me .
What man were you talking to at your window last night , between the hours of midnight and one ?
As you can see , these lovers are looking for a place to fight .
Yes , you're absolutely right .
But I don't have any good sides .
He's been killed .
Please , hurry up .
What else did you hear ?
Isn't it completely moral to kill him now with this sword , and an easy conscience ?
Yes , I remember .
What do you want ?
I'd rather break my own heart .
Who's sounding that alarm ?
Dromio , what stuff of mine did you put on a ship ?
Goodbye .
But he's young , and as long as he's too young to become king , Richard , the duke of Gloucester , has power over him .
My lord , what I say may be a little confused , since I'm half asleep and half awake .
Would you like some more sauce to go with it ?
Mistress !
Give me your blessing .
Goodbye , sir .
You know what , my lord ?
The storm separated us .
It's your music , madam , from your house .
More or less .
Come , come , you're making fun of me .
Do whatever you want with it .
Oh , oh , Edmund , I don't like this monstrous business .
She cursed Hastings then .
Let's go back to court together , but
God give him health .
But go ahead and charm her , gentle Paris ; make her love you .
Oh , my old master ! , Who tied him up ?
Command this man to leave .
But I'll tell you something from my soul .
This castle is in a pleasant place .
My husband will never get a moment's rest , I'll keep him up at night talking about you until he runs out
Cut off their heads ?
Is he all right ?
Well , I'll hurry and put these papers where you told me .
Your doctors have expressly forbidden me to sleep with you , as there's a risk that you might have a relapse .
Call me when it's lit .
How can I bring those promises back down to earth , unless my husband sends them back down to me by dying and going to heaven ?
Three thousand ducats for three months , and Antonio will guarantee it .
And your lies caused this murder .
Help , my lord of Norfolk , help , help !
You'll fight with him eventually , and The duke , my father , loved his father very much .
And I'm going to sleep .
Yes , we should get his support , for his mature presence will make others think well of us and speak out in support of our actions .
And a true lover of the holy Church .
You're smart , though , and if you were sick , you'd take what you needed to get better .
Tell me !
For God's sake , shut up !
Will you come with me to hear this news , sir ?
Why are your swords out ?
The lieutenant has to get to heaven before the ensign .
But mock me gently , dear Kate , because I love you terribly .
Why are you whipping that whore ?
Look , he can become invisible .
What should I pay you ?
This is a rotten song to sing at a man's funeral .
Did it stay a long time ?
Where are you , Pindarus ?
Oh Cassius , I'm tired out by many sorrows .
Well , then , you don't have the affection that would teach you that you and I are one .
Listen , listen !
One face , one voice , one way of dressing , but two people !
For heaven's sake , stop this savage brawl !
Very serious , and I'm sure it's because of Beatrice .
Get away from me , Satan !
I'll lie here tonight .
Not explicitly , but so what ?
Gentle cousin , let's go thank him and encourage him .
On a night like this !
I was about to swear that I loved you .
That's three hours since nine o'clock , but she hasn't come back .
But did you tell him she cheated on him ?
What does she want ?
Good .
He's running bareheaded , calling for the end of the world , out there on a night like this , when even savage animals ravenous with hunger crawl under cover and hide .
I am resolved , to let him live .
If the devil had such a beautiful house as his body , then good things would fight to live in it .
Our poor father , Clarence !
get his position and use him to hurt Othello at the same time ?
Oh , grief has transformed me since the last time you saw me .
Good morning , father .
If he's caught the Benedick , he'll lose all his money before he's cured .
Pay attention to Metellus Cimber .
I don't have any news to report , my lord .
Madam , please let me see your face .
I've promised them I would , and they're expecting it .
How can they refuse to speak with me ?
Come , explain .
He is the son and heir of old Tiberio .
Come , let's be off !
If you insist on trying my patience any further , then take out your sword right now .
My God , it's nauseating !
Even innocents can not always escape disaster .
And even if they don't , at least Hero's supposed death will stop the rumors of her infidelity .
What if she's pretty but stupid ?
Oh , deadly sin !
Yes , I see them coming .
Good-bye , noble Agrippa .
Take me to Octavius .
Why not stay and hear me talk to him ?
No , sir , worse off .
If it's fighting he is after , some of us here should run and hide .
I don't know how .
Get up and tell me how you came here .
Good afternoon , fair lady .
Cure her of that .
I'm not sure it's true , but just the suspicion is enough for me .
King Lear , I've always honored you as king , loved you as my father , obeyed you as my master , and thanked you in my prayers , I'm furious and ready to snap .
I didn't survive a shipwreck so I could be scared of your four legs now .
In this letter you'll find details of her illness and other , more serious matters that concern you .
I think that Macedon is indeed where Alexander was born .
So , my sweet brother-in-law , go inside .
Here , hang them on this clothesline .
Liberty !
Release me So I can return to my dukedom With your help .
creet .
I have the motivation , the willpower , the ability , and the means to do it .
Will I be married tomorrow morning ?
And his voice is the paramour of sweetness .
They're in the heat of passion ; they simply have to be together .
I'll cross myself .
I wish you all the comfort that such a dark night as this can offer , noble father-in-law .
Say something again .
Young man , your father's dead .
Bring me his answers quickly .
I sink under the heavy weight of love .
Where am I ?
What worries have kept you awake tonight ?
Good night , my lord .
We're very sorry , sir , that you may not live to wear us out with your commands .
Why are the branches still living when the root is gone ?
Quiet !
Answer me straightforwardly .
Everybody may do as they please until seven o'clock tonight .
Why , then , should I cry ?
I'm satisfied .
Don't disturb the heavens any more by trying to go against heaven's will .
As faithful as flies in rotting meat , which give birth to maggots every time the wind blows .
But please , forgive me , your highness .
Let's follow them .
Master , do you really mean that ?
What's the matter , lady ?
Keep your voice down .
Denmark's a prison .
Yes , monstrous , monstrous !
But what did you want ?
Then that's the way it may turn out .
The carriages , sir , are the hangers , where the swords hang .
Which ring did you give away , my lord ?
Cram your good news into my ears .
Sex and marriage are honorable things , even for a beggar , right ?
So Rosencrantz and Guildenstern are in for it .
There's a feud between the two dukes .
And those eyes were endowed with sight by Claudio , the Prince , and me .
Why , sir , I spent it on this rope .
Happy with Hermia ?
I'm very glad about that .
Very sad .
Where did you die ?
This contract doesn't give you any blood at all .
Have a seat .
Goodbye .
Nonsense !
This world is almost six thousand years old , and in all this time not one man has ever actually died from love .
Oh , darling Phoebe , if you ever fall in love with some fresh face , then you'll know about the invisible wounds that love's sharp arrows can make .
You have my word as a gentleman that I'll always be grateful to you .
Listen to that Petruchio : she says she'll see you hanged first .
Yes , my lord .
You'll see , I promise you .
Go .
But if you fail , you have to leave immediately .
Why do you look like a frightened goose ?
That's a sin young men often commit because they allow their eyes to wander .
Yes .
I don't know what to say .
No , he's in Florence .
I'm Launcelot , who was your boy , is your son , and will be your child .
Keep my cups full and treat me as you did when my empire was one of your fellow servants , obeying my commands .
Hello to you too , sir .
You opposed my taking part in the war .
Get him to say his prayers , Sir Toby , get him to pray .
No doubt it will , my liege , if each man does his best .
That's the one : Leonato's Hero , your Hero , every man's Hero .
Here's some money for you .
On a night like this , young Lorenzo swore he loved her very much , stealing her heart with vows of love , but not one vow was true .
She was worried about my absence , and about the fact that young Octavius and Mark Antony have grown so strong , which I found out at the same time as the news of her death .
The taming school ?
We're wasting time here .
Why , would that have fixed my hair ?
I never gave him any token of romantic love .
Save that kind of harsh language for your worst enemy .
Nothing but cruel daughters could have degraded him like this .
Why are you hiding that letter ?
My Cordelia , even the gods admire how much you've sacrificed for me .
He's dead and rotting in the dirt now .
Is your name Goneril ?
My love , call him back in here .
Whom should I knock ?
Why don't you go off to church dancing one way , and come home dancing another way ?
I recently shared a bed with Cassio , and I couldn't sleep because of a raging toothache .
It's the last command I shall ever give you .
Is Claudio your enemy ?
You !
So the life that died with shame Lives on with fame .
Sir !
Live , Brutus !
Sir , I wouldn't say I was your friend , but I've praised you when you deserved ten times more praise than I gave .
Sirs , never mind .
If you had any sense of pity , or manners , you wouldn't pretend to fight over me like this .
Who's there !
My lord , I know what I'm saying .
A friend .
Let's go !
No !
Then the Jew must show you mercy .
It wouldn't surprise me , my lord .
Now , on my life , the young child must be headed to the Tower to greet the young princes , whom she adores .
Didn't great Caesar bleed for the sake of justice ?
Is it lunchtime ?
I had a round with him , and his sword thrust is so deadly that you can't even duck out of the way .
Are you talking , you villain ?
And what should I give you that would be equal in value to this rare and precious gift ?
Dear woman , you don't know the rules of charity .
Besides , you've gotten unreliable .
How is she ?
Do you want to sleep ?
They say there are only five people on it .
I tell you , I'll either make him eat some part of this leek or give him a four-day head-bashing. , Go on , bite .
Come on then .
Now , my dearest Queen , Please , stand farther away from me .
No , please , save it for dinner conversation .
Not at all , not at all .
If she restrained your rowdy knights , she had such a good reason that you can't blame her for it .
I said "your husband." , Do you understand that word ?
It's noble Kent , your friend .
The clock struck three .
What , you dare put your hands on me , villain ?
Now come sing around the cauldron like a ring of elves and fairies , enchanting everything you put in .
Favorably , except that there wasn't enough time for his Grace to hear , as I sensed he would have liked to , the details about how he is rightfully entitled to certain dukedoms in France , and to the throne of France in general , through clear lines of descent originating with his great-grandfather , Edward III .
I've never seen him like this .
Our imminent separation so occupies our thoughts that even though you stay here , you come with me , and even though I leave here , I stay with you .
But come , my lord , let's go .
There is a way , ma'am .
Now we can shout , "Congratulations , congratulations , my lord and lady ! " My Lord Bassanio , and my dear lady , I wish you all the joy I can wish for .
The alcohol that got the servants drunk has made me bold .
The wiser the woman , the wilder .
Let the blood rushing to my cheeks be calmed .
He called her a whore so many times , and heaped up so much abuse on her that good people can't stand to hear it .
What do you have to tell me ?
God will protect me .
Unfaithful , my lord ?
That's definitely too old .
No , I won't stay a second longer .
I'll have glory in this losing day , more than Octavius and Mark Antony will gain by their foul conquest .
Get up and listen to me .
What does my hidden wife say about our ruined love ?
Forgive us , my lord .
Sweet , sweet , sweet Nurse , tell me , what did my love Romeo say ?
Don't play any nasty tricks on me .
Please be careful .
There , take it all back , plates , cups , the whole thing .
He really is the most skillful , bloodthirsty , and dangerous opponent you can find in Illyria .
Discipline must be kept .
Are you talking about the crown ?
But if you see a wheel going uphill , latch on for the ride .
I'm wide awake .
My body waits here , but the rest of me is gone .
Yes , I'm sure he will , to stay with you .
What's the news !
Come on , woo me , woo me .
I remember a fight , but not why we were fighting .
You say you don't know what the girl thinks .
How could it be wisdom !
Nothing .
If that's what you say , go fight a duel with me and prove it .
I'd say I was "out of my element , " but that phrase is overused , so I'll say I'm "out of my air."
And if it doesn't go well , then you can keep her hidden in a nunnery , the best place for someone with her kind of dirtied reputation , away from the public's eyes , tongues , mind , and insults .
Please smile whenever you're near me , my dearest darling."
Tear him to pieces .
By all that's holy , here comes Katherina !
You must not go without having a drink first .
You'll be pricked all over , and it'll sting like bees .
Go on .
I mean , what sort of man is he ?
Alas , I hate myself instead , because of the hateful deeds I've committed .
I thank you all .
Oh , it's too terrible .
Your father would be a fool to give you all his wealth and spend his declining years as a guest in your house .
And what did he say ?
No .
Let me enjoy my privacy .
That's why he hates me .
Put
When should the three of us meet again ?
Herbs , plants , and stones possess great power .
When she takes a sip , I bob up against her lips and make her spill the drink all over her withered old neck .
It goes along with being born to greatness , but it makes you get badmouthed by every fool who only has his own suffering to care about .
Put the goblets of wine on that table .
That's what he says .
Or rather , do what you feel like doing .
I'm not talking with you .
I'd tell them that I saw natives like these , since they must be natives , who are graceful and well-mannered even if they're monstrous to look at , kinder than most human beings you might find , kinder than almost any human .
What has Caesar done to deserve your love ?
Oh , except for the widow Dido ?
She lives about twenty miles from Athens , and she thinks of me as a son .
Besides , she treats me more respectfully than the other servants .
If you keep on the way you've been going , you'll kill yourself .
Your wife wouldn't like it if she were here to hear you make that offer .
I'll go hunting again tomorrow , I think .
And the men resemble their English hounds in their loud , showy ferocity , too , leaving their brains behind with their wives .
I can't hide what I am .
No , a woman's gentle brain could never have come up with such crude expressions and even harsher meanings .
The more fool you for betting on my loyalty .
Don't you see that I'm out of breath ?
Has it been so long ?
God and your work be praised , victorious friends .
She's cheating on me ?
My name's Macbeth .
Besides that , he says that two meetings are going to be held tomorrow , and something may be decided at one of them that may make you and him , who are at the other , sorry .
You refused me both .
No , just help me unpin this .
That's him .
And it's all your fault .
Then leave him out .
Anything your Highness suffered in that disguise , I beg you to see it as your own fault and not mine , because if you'd been what I took you for , there would have been no offense .
It's Captain Macmorris , right ?
The best way to be happy is to be in between .
This is the silliest thing I've ever seen .
What , don't courtiers ' hands sweat ?
You're not paying attention to me .
Just notice .
He's in They say he cried out against sherry .
Spread the rumor abroad that Anne , my wife , is very sick .
Get out of here , before his bad luck infects you too .
Did you accompany Caesar home ?
I know where he is .
Don't ask why .
Oh painful day , Oh painful day !
Then it's confirmed !
This is no place for you ; this home is now a slaughterhouse .
Their names are marked .
Swear your love for each other .
My brother didn't use my name to justify his rebellion .
My uncle ?
Oh nature , what were you doing in hell ?
I wouldn't commit so serious a crime for anything .
Do you have to harp on my inadequacy ?
Are these spirits we see before us ?
But though I was born here and should consider that tradition part of my own heritage , I think it would be better to ignore it than practice it .
I've shut the memory of your beautiful eyes out of my heart .
No doubt , but you may be going about it the wrong way , Neighbor , this gift is very gracious , I'm sure .
What did that gentile fool say to you , hmmm ?
Now , you tell me : should I feel loyal to the Moor ?
Is this the Prince ?
Often I have heard of "sanctuary men , " but until now I've never heard of "sanctuary children." My lord , you've won me over this time .
The king has been informed of all their plans , but they have no idea .
All these quarrels are about me .
Go away .
Nice to see you again , Horatio , that is your name , right ?
His eyes used to glow with pride when he reviewed his troops .
From my house , if I had a house , " "The sixth of July .
Let me try : If there's a buck who needs a doe Tell him Rosalind will do .
Sir , fifteen days of March have gone by .
Yes , I'll wipe my mind clean of all trivial facts and memories and preserve only your commandment there .
So I can sleep away the time while my Antony is gone .
The woman I love is beautiful .
There's no darkness except ignorance , and you're more ignorant than the Egyptians during the plague of fog .
Meet me and Gratiano at his house in about an hour .
You got to me first .
My God , that's my handkerchief !
Well , don't face off with me .
They have wings .
But you were with him , weren't you ?
Is it them ?
I was wrong to her , Do you know how an oyster makes its shell ?
Just tell me .
But you , my noble lords , may name a time , and I'll second it on the duke's behalf , which I don't think he'll mind .
Damn those men shouting down there !
Let this solemn melody comfort your fevered minds , which are now useless , seething inside your skulls. , All of you stand there in my spell. ,
Of all the strange things I've ever heard , it seems most strange to me that men fear death , given that death , which can't be avoided , will come whenever it wants .
Come on , then .
I'll copy the embroidery pattern and then give it to Iago .
Just as you got Milan , I'll get Naples .
My evidence that you have wronged me is that you condemned and disgraced Lucius Pella for taking bribes here from the Sardinians , and you ignored my letters , where I argued that he was innocent ; I know the man .
Sweet saint , for goodness's sake , don't be so angry .
No , I'll slit the nose of the villain who would have sent me to jail .
If I could say hello to the fifth one as happily as I'll say goodbye to the first four , I'd be very happy he's coming .
You will always be welcome to me .
Well , do what you want .
But action speaks louder than words , so I'll cut short these polite words .
He can't go in there because of the candle .
If she feels like coming over here , I'll give her your message .
Come , come , hurry up .
Why , Caesar straddles the narrow world like a giant , and we petty men walk under his huge legs and look forward only to dying dishonorably , as slaves .
So be it .
What's that ?
No , our general's infatuation is out of control .
You , fellow , step out of the crowd .
He abandoned his friend here in an emergency , and even pretended he didn't know him .
There are two opposite elements in everything , in men as well as in herbs , good and evil .
Now everyone be seated , as this is the part where we sit and chat as well as eat .
So be quiet .
Here's to you !
You will pretend to be a schoolmaster and offer to teach the girl .
A little bit .
Why , mistress , my master is as angry as a bull with horns .
It's called the evil .
Are you hiding your forehead with a golden crown , when , if there was any justice in this world , it should be branded with the murders you committed , your slaughter of the prince who held that crown , and of my sons and my brothers ?
A knight on a quest ?
Good afternoon , my dear lord !
That's what's clever about it .
I'm telling the truth .
If it pleases you , your highness , will you lead us all inside ?
Did you leave on good terms ?
In private ?
I want to speak with Clarence , and I came here on my legs .
Is that the law ?
There's a spirit in here !
But what if my answer's no ?
No , she's worse : she's the devil's mother , and she comes to us disguised as an easy wench .
Everything's fine .
That's my way , when I see a crab-apple .
You probably killed a lot of his men ?
What would you like me to do ?
I wish she were in her coffin here , with the ducats in her coffin !
You're all lazy and shallow .
Oh , Cassius , if you could only convince Brutus to join us , Don't worry .
Sir , pardon me for what I am about to say .
Not bad ; you might accomplish something .
Swear you won't .
Ratcliffe , my lord , it's me .
I , Wall , have done my part .
Just tell me what you want me to do , and however hard it is , you'll see that I'm eager to do it .
Oh , poor Romeo !
I could imagine he's divine , since I never saw anything so noble-looking on earth before .
Therefore it's certain that he wasn't ambitious .
What , you're not a whore ?
And request that she come here .
On one and the same trip Claribel found a husband in Tunis , and Ferdinand , her brother , found a wife where he was shipwrecked ; Prospero found his dukedom on a poor island ; and all of us found ourselves when we lost control of ourselves .
I could have sworn he trampled on me .
Do you ?
You all know this cloak .
I've already slept , my lord .
Everyone there got a little crazy and pulled some desperate stunts .
Signor Valentio and his cousin Tybalt , Lucio and the lively Helena." That's a nice group of people .
Don't listen to the bell , Duncan , because it summons you either to heaven or to hell .
Oh , what a mean low-life I am !
Who , me ?
Go get me something I can use to break down the door .
Be pointed and brief .
You've already done something you should be sorry for .
What do you think ?
Yes , and don't let anyone come in , or else I'll break your head .
Then he'll be as calm and quiet as a dove waiting for her eggs to hatch .
That's when you gave them the spanking paddle and pulled your pants down , Please , uncle , hire a teacher who can teach your fool to lie .
Did you see the gloomy Lord Northumberland ?
Dear general , I never gave you any reason to hate me .
What do you mean I faked you out ?
How am I evil to advise Cassio to do exactly what'll do him good ?
It used to be that when you knocked a man's brains out he would just die , and that would be it .
Who are these people ?
She'll die for it. , Eros , ho !
What , the necklace ?
I have a wife I love .
No , leave him alone .
And then throw the seeds in the sea , to make more islands grow .
God gives those gifts , I had nothing to do with it .
The original story was written in the finest Italian .
Yes , I did , my lord .
I don't know what to think about this .
Awake , my lords !
In that case , there's reason to hope a man's memory may outlive him by six months .
Stay , lovely Helena .
Men's eyes were made to see things , so let them watch .
Shame of what , lady ?
It is .
Sir , a word before you go .
I've botched the job , friends .
So , if all turns out fine , as you say , it's more than we deserve or I expect .
Madam , tell me quickly , what day is that ?
I'll say you're not feeling well .
Are you ill ?
She confessed .
Father , what's the news ?
Benedick , Beatrice praised your wit the other day .
I'm terribly sleepy .
You'll be afraid to hear it .
That's a good way of putting it .
Has the storm passed ?
That's old news .
Hey , Grumio !
We will go in together .
I'll only admit that you're sane when you agree with Pythagoras and hesitate to kill a bird because it might contain your grandmother's soul .
He was graced with lots of natural gifts , he was young , valiant , wise , and no doubt meant to be king .
Yes , but the mustard is probably too hot .
Indeed , my lord .
Of course I will .
Oh , young and noble Cato , have you been slain ?
I'll go wait for Dromio at the marketplace .
When I said that , I told you the truth .
If there's enough wind for a ship to sail out tonight , I won't spend tonight in this town .
But fathers who are rich Make their children kind .
Can we finish our lunch ?
It looks great .
He brings me freedom .
You are not as happy as Macbeth , yet much happier .
Sometimes I appeared in many places at once .
Well , then , be brave and pretend to be a man .
Well , sir , I'll take you to Lear and have you stay with him a while .
You may think that I don't love you .
Hang on a minute , who are you ?
I wish the night were here already !
If we meet again , then we'll smile indeed .
I know the burden of hosting him is both an honor and a trouble , but that doesn't mean it's not a trouble just the same .
It's the tragedy of our times that lunatics must lead the blind .
He was not born to be shameful .
Watch out !
Come on , sir , will you come aboard ?
Why , she's a lamb , a dove , a child compared to him !
Where ?
Didn't I turn down the page where I left off reading ?
Here he comes .
Fled to England ?
I'll join you , sir .
Get somebody strong to carry him out of here .
But he has to make his speeches of love to a woman who's supposed to be his enemy .
Have Lucius and Titinius guard the door .
The muffled queen" ?
That's no lie .
Antonio , as I heard in Genoa , What , what , what ?
You may , Mark Antony .
Your preparation for war sounds like something .
So that's what I'll do , not because I love her but because I'll get something out of it .
And if he doesn't deserve this joy on earth , he'll never deserve it in heaven .
But I'll admit I don't care for you .
I can't enjoy either of them as long as the other one's alive .
I've stayed up with you for two nights now , and I haven't seen any evidence of what you were talking about .
Well , sir , my mistress is the sweetest lady .
I can't believe that .
Feed him apricots and blackberries , with purple grapes , green figs , and mulberries .
Follow her .
What havoc have you wreaked in this part of the forest ?
No woman is strong enough to put up with the kind of intense passion I feel .
It's on such a high tide that we're now floating , and we must take the current when it is offered , or lose our campaign .
Didn't you know ?
Shall I come down ?
That's most appropriate .
That's the one part of my service on land I do deny .
Who's that ?
It's too bad .
No , Pompey , I haven't had anything to drink .
An honest guy who's as poor as the king .
He likes me , and I've given him good reason to .
If I'm telling the truth like a fool in saying all this , whip the first person who thinks I sound foolish .
Hail , Caesar !
Did he express any dissatisfaction with you , either in his words or his face ?
Only really cruel people can be called deformed .
What is my nation ?
So they are possibly Antony's friends .
How ?
Please go back to Goneril's house .
I admit I'm only a woman , but nevertheless I'm the woman Lord Brutus took for his wife .
You're right , actually .
Say goodbye to me .
It was just like in real life , dark brown with silver whiskers in it .
I hope you are pleased with the snake .
We have enough supplies for it , and they've earned it .
God protect me from these two !
Prepare yourself , please , for this trip .
And now , let's turn to our business with the French .
My lord , I'd want to have the gift you promised me on your honor : the earldom of Hereford and all the possessions that go with it .
Go away , get out of here , and stop following me .
What an idiot this guy is ! , You're a rotten piece of work ! , I beg your highness , beat him up and take his wine bottle from him .
How are you , sir ?
I don't understand .
But look , Cassius , Caesar looks angry and everyone else looks as if they've been scolded .
That since she's mad herself , she's married a madman .
Do so , good Messala .
You lying brat .
You're wearing dancing shoes with nimble soles .
And you yourself will determine the sentence as you see fit , and impose the death penalty if you choose to , even if the criminal were my own son .
I'll finish my lecture after dinner .
Go to bed , and sleep .
Any man can get drunk sometime .
Why , he won't wake up till Judgment Day .
But if you die before I return , you'll have made a mockery of my efforts .
I don't trust you .
I'll see them safely married first and then hurry back to my master's .
May He bless you , too .
They'll tell all .
The ones you've sent our lunatic king to .
Here's the head of that notorious traitor , the dangerous and unsuspected Hastings .
And so , beautiful lady , I'm standing here just like that , wondering whether all this can be true until you tell me it is .
On land you keep the legions and cavalry together , don't you ?
What's the matter ?
Like a young man who wants to amount to something , this morning begins early .
Don't believe any of us .
Royal seductress !
What an ass I am .
I order you to stop !
Oh , goodbye to my peace of mind !
What did you mean by not helping me ?
Hold your tongue .
Where will we meet in the morning ?
I'm telling you , it's not lost .
I'll test it out .
Are you Tyrrel ?
Now , daughter Katherine ?
I did .
But you still wish the gods had made me poetical ?
Do I , sir ?
Look !
I love rich Capulet's daughter .
I'm telling you , it's hers .
And what irks me more than all these things put together is that he does it under the pretense of love , as though for me to eat or sleep would bring on fatal illness or sudden death .
He refuses , as he is free of vanity and self-serving pride and ascribes all the glory and responsibility for victory to God .
And what's the point , sir ?
Yes , return and tell me if your master looks well , because he was sick when he left .
She is not sick , my lord , but she is troubled with endless visions that keep her from sleeping .
Yes , sir .
I'll do that , because I have to tell my brother how you forgave him , Rosalind .
You lie .
of patience .
Well , sir , the gown is not for me .
This is Trebonius .
My master's a total Jew .
Kent's been banished just like that ?
You're going to lose this bet , my lord .
What are you going to do now ?
Evidence enough to deceive the Prince , anger Claudio , ruin Hero , and kill Leonato .
But in that "no hope" there are great hopes for you !
But I surrender all this magic now , when I've summoned some heavenly music to cast a spell , as I'm doing now , I'll break my staff and bury it far underground , and throw my book of magic spells deeper into the sea than any anchor ever sank .
That's because the murderer is alive .
Yes , but swear by my sword this time .
Let's give them room .
I'll kill myself to save myself from slavery .
And I beg you , please come here again tomorrow .
To escape the decree condemning me
Listen !
Will we be separated ?
The sun will not appear today .
Twenty crowns ?
Has anyone offended your Worship ?
I'd rather have lost my legs in battle than be a part of this !
The king has agreed to every point : first his daughter , then everything else , as you strictly proposed .
It was probably just a rumor .
Lucentio , sir .
Look for him , Titinius , while I go to meet the noble Brutus and force him to hear this news .
Cover the sky with a low-hanging fog , as dark as hell , and get these overeager rivals so completely lost in the woods that they can't run into each other .
No .
Listen to me , good Shylock .
So be it .
Even if you had your eyes , you still might not recognize me .
This is Lucentio's house .
Three or four women near me cried , "Alas , good soul ! " and forgave him with all their hearts .
Did you inform them of that ?
Well , all right then .
You poor soul , your face has suffered many tears .
He looks calmer than he did before .
But this whole thing is strange .
I like this girl !
Well , Aren't I right , Jephthah , old man ?
Oh , this day has turned into a disaster !
I've heard that's not the most nourishing food .
Ha , ha !
Richard , the duke of Gloucester , hates you .
You have , my lord .
Call yourself your own sister , because I want you .
You've won the wager , and I will add twenty thousand crowns to what they owe you .
Yes , Celia , we kept her here for your sake .
Yes , that's all true , but what do you mean by it , my lord ?
I don't even know him .
Since Cleopatra died , I have lived in such dishonor that the gods despise my disgrace .
The It's too bad there's more of the Moor than there ought to be .
And like mine , but I'm getting a little tired of it .
Do I blame Nature for being so thrifty ?
But I've been sent to find the people whose names are written on this list , and I can't read !
I didn't like the way a particular courtier had cut his beard .
Oh , my poor Rosalind , where will you go ?
So it's no surprise that Demetrius runs away from me as if I were a monster .
This may have seemed like the pinnacle of sadness , but if I went on I could outdo it .
Why not !
Excellent , good .
Don't talk to me , Emilia .
Cruel , cruel news !
It's a job meant for a man , but not you .
Well , then it isn't one to you , since nothing is really good or bad in itself , it's all what a person thinks about it .
Gratiano !
Where's my fool ?
Weren't you the one who made him desert Perigouna in the middle of the night , right after he'd raped her ?
My Lord of Oxford , you , Sir William Brandon , and you , Sir Walter Herbert , are going to stay with me .
It's true , my lord .
So prepare to die .
Maybe they call me that because I am cheerful .
Don't worry about me .
The wisdom of your loyalty , fair Bianca , has cost me a hundred crowns since dinner .
Do we have devils on the island ?
Boy , your words can't excuse the harm you've done to me .
That's "Ninus's grave , " man .
Sunday is just around the corner .
She doesn't have anything going for her so far .
We'll talk about this later .
Sorry , sir , Goodman Verges tends to ramble .
Are you afraid to act the way you desire ?
Captain Macmorris , when we have more leisure , see , I will be so bold as to show you I know about the practice of warfare , and that's that .
Call to him , Mercutio .
We'll all join hands and sing , and bless this place with our fairy grace .
Oh , Hamlet , how far she fell !
You're right , Charmian .
I'm almost ready to break down hearing this much .
No , none at all .
Let's stay and hear the will !
Hail , King of Scotland !
I'll let you know right away how it's going .
Help !
Since it's drizzling , stand under this overhang with me and , like a true drunk , I'll tell you everything .
toward his own father who loves him so completely .
Antipholus owes me the exact amount that I owe you .
It was my magic that saved you when I arrived on the island and heard you , making the pine tree open and let you out .
Let me see them .
Now I feel my soul leaving .
One criminal punishes another .
Then I'll pay you for doing what you like .
So , what hour of comfort have I ever had in your company ?
I tricked your own eyes .
I can only walk a little way with you , since I'm waiting here .
Halt !
It was a color he never did like .
Now , good sweet Nurse , Oh Lord , why do you look so sad ?
You mean the sun !
Follow me .
Yes , they have .
What soldiers , milk-face ?
Yes , ma'am .
I leave a slimy bastard with you , your Worship , for you to punish and make an example of .
How did he look ?
What kind of work is this , Charmian ?
A house , a person ?
Stay , then .
I hope it doesn't make me unchaste that I really want to be a married woman .
Judge for yourself .
If he had as many lives as he's got hairs on his head , I would've killed them all in revenge .
Please go .
I have to leave right away .
Yes , well , things could get better .
That useless old man still thinks he can wield all the powers he's given away .
Nobody will hurt us .
I'm very sorry I was so hard on him .
Good Prince , say something !
Isn't that the reason you told me all this ?
Why are you adored ?
Get lost , will you ?
He had his helmet visor up .
I'll make you an example for the others to learn from .
You're forgetting yourself when you back me into a corner .
I like the morning .
What did he do that made him flee this land ?
On a night like this a campfire in an empty field would be like the heart of a dirty old man , a tiny spark in a cold body .
I don't know what to say .
Carry him to my best room , gently , so he doesn't wake , and hang all my erotic paintings around him .
You get my point , don't you ?
I hear his footsteps .
But you're keeping a hundred knights here who are so disorderly , vulgar , and obnoxious that our noble court is starting to look like a noisy cheap hotel .
For love to appear in his true likeness , he would have to be as Cupid is : naked and blind .
I was reminded of my son , even though I despised my son at that time .
No , I had to do something .
There are ten thousand , Geese , you idiot ?
You take out your sword too .
All right ! " It's not fine , and I'm not all right !
Don't worry , Baptista , you'll be perfectly satisfied .
All right , but first let the ambassadors speak .
I'll do whatever the king wants .
That's what the bill says .
Last night she got no sleep , and she won't get any tonight .
Now please go .
So don't advise me .
My belongings are on the ship already .
I'll take responsibility for that .
I didn't think I would see you here .
I serve the king , who sent me here .
You started a fight with a man who coughed in the street because he woke up a dog that was sleeping in the sun .
If I can disguise my voice as well as my appearance , then I'll be able to carry out my plan perfectly .
All three of us will marry now in death .
What's going on here ?
Oh , it's horrible of her .
Oh , royal Caesar !
Well , there they are .
Yes , that's the idea .
There it is .
I hear someone coming .
You left him out in the storm in the black night , bareheaded , a storm so terrible that if it had happened at sea , the waters would have risen up and extinguished the fire burning in the stars .
I'm at your service .
I won't play the fool anymore and just cry while my husband and his man laugh at me .
To repay her for her troubles , Death Gives her undying fame .
Scratch my head , Peaseblossom .
What are you doing ?
Aren't the others waiting for me , Cinna ?
That pretty boy , Claudio ?
If you really love me , you'll find me. , Nerissa and the rest of you , get away from him .
And whoever is most irritated by my foolishness has to laugh the hardest .
Tell your men as much .
Sister , be happy in my unhappiness. , Sir , I will humbly obey you .
Foreign savages who eat their own children for dinner will be as close to my heart as you , ex-daughter of mine .
Then I'll be quick .
My lord , no one will believe this in Venice , even though I'd swear I saw it with my own eyes .
No , Lysander .
Tell me where you learned these strange things , and why you stop us at this desolate place with this prophetic greeting ?
There's nothing more .
And her cook yelled , mocked , and teased me , right ?
The spirits that know the future have told me this : "Don't be afraid , Macbeth .
Do you know him ?
For that kind of relief , the patient must heal herself .
Madam , you have to go to your uncle's .
I won't trouble you yet with questions about your situation. , Some music , please , and , good friend , sing .
I changed my mind .
Enliven them with yours !
But where is my love ?
Who does he accuse ?
Have faith , love me , and you will get better .
I've had very little joy as England's queen .
Give me a hand and help me off with this magic cloak .
I'll get there first and tell him what we found out .
What do you have to say , my dear Nurse ?
Will you come with me ?
Most noble Caesar !
He can act as brave as he wants , but I believe on a cold night like this he wishes he were neck-deep in the Thames , and I wish he were , too , and I with him , whatever the danger , so long as we were far away from here .
The lady's overdoing it , I think .
I don't think he wants to be disturbed .
I'd like to get to know you better , Mr. Cobweb .
But like an unruly deer , he's always trespassing past the park borders and straying away from home to feed in new pastures .
Hey , are you biting your thumb at us ?
What we are is up to us .
My lord , I will help you , even if it means I have to stay awake for ten nights straight .
Then , gentlemen , we can count on trouble .
I'll come back .
Tom's chilly .
Will you cry about your cousin's death forever ?
That's what I conceive of him .
What other rites are you going to give her ?
I charge you , in the name of God , be careful what you say .
Oh , no , he's surely not in hell .
Where do you come from , sir ?
You have the nerve to call me daughter ?
Either the lovers have different social standings ,
Is your other mouth calling my name ?
My mistress , " I said .
Kate is as straight and slender as a hazel-twig , her hair as brown as hazelnut shells , and she herself sweeter than the kernels .
Sir , these accusations should be answered .
Great Duke , be merciful to mortal men .
I don't like what you're asking me to do .
Greetings , good general !
He should go up and offer his petition to Caesar now .
This king is a branch of that same victorious stock .
But it'd take a miracle to make me believe she could do anything that horrible .
Hitting his wife ?
Now I must go to the tomb alone .
Here .
Fortinbras swore never to threaten Denmark again .
Oh , immortal gods !
Think about it .
I know you .
It's true , Hero says so .
Or did you agree to this as equals ?
There's no other way .
Oh , you mean when Beatrice writes a letter and Hero sees that it has "Benedick" and "Beatrice" written all over it ?
That's good , my boy .
Good lady , don't be angry with the child .
Well , learn to make jokes at the appropriate time .
I never tried to win over a friend or enemy with sweet words .
He thinks "G" is me .
Welcome , traveler .
Do the deed that will make this island yours forever , and will make me , Caliban , your worshipful foot-licker .
then I hope I have a life of misery !
I haven't seen him for two days .
Niece , you are exceptionally perceptive .
Go announce that he will be executed , and tell Macbeth that Cawdor's titles will be given to him .
But she must be , Friar .
Quiet !
Well , I wouldn't want to undo the naughtiness , since the boy turned out so well .
Wife !
That our clothes were drenched with sea water , but they came out looking brand-new .
What is the tyrant Macbeth doing ?
Me neither .
Think like that , and you'll manage to get honey out of a common weed and find a moral lesson in the devil himself .
You will , my lord .
We are free from his tyranny .
Are you crazy ?
The king my father ? !
Oh , no , that was my lady's voice .
It looks like these witches are scared of swords .
Wipe your eyes .
Never !
Is this really happening ?
You haven't got it in you to frown or look displeased or bite your lip as angry women do .
Caesar and Antony have always achieved more by delegating authority to their officers than by leading their troops in person .
Until I know for sure , I'll humor her .
Oh God ! , Oh Nurse , how can this be stopped ?
Sebastian was my father's name , and my brother was named Sebastian too .
Ah , how will this all turn out ?
No , really , I'm not .
My poor husband , my dear Edward !
Is the throne empty ?
It was yours , I swear .
Honest to God , where's the sexton ?
Where's America and the West Indies ?
Can't any prayers reach your heart ?
What do I see here ?
Which one of you killed the deer ?
To bed !
No , son .
But I have the meantime .
Tonight he boarded a treasure ship .
This is the prophecy that the wizard
A worthy fool !
Are you going to get me in trouble ?
Answer me this , please : where's the money I gave you ?
Tell us what you know about this affair .
Our men have all broken ranks .
If it pleases your Majesty , it is the token of a man I must fight with , if he's still alive .
Yes , like your horse , who , staggering under your boasts , would trot more easily if some of them dismounted .
His most horrible murder .
You'll "never trust his word again." Come on , that was a stupid thing to say .
Let's start .
I'll give you letters of introduction to some friends of mine who will help you .
Catesby , fly to the duke .
Welcome , dear Rosencrantz and Guildenstern .
I hope Demetrius comes to love you as much as you love him !
Not from crying .
I've promised to make everything right .
Even the traits that become me most kill me when you don't approve of them .
Let's go to the temple first .
He brought many captives home to Rome whose ransoms brought wealth to the city .
They're good enough to drink in , and so are these boots .
But let her live .
Good night .
That's what I want you to tell me .
Usually that means a person is foolish .
This isn't the death of one man .
If not , then I have no powers of observation .
Do as I told you .
I swear to you by Rosalind's own pretty hand that I am that unfortunate man .
But for the whole world ?
He followed the old man .
You don't need eyes to see how the world works .
For assuredly , you are so near the abyss that you're bound to be swallowed up .
I saw Mark Antony offer him a crown , though it wasn't a real crown , just a small circlet , and , as I told you , he refused it once , though in my opinion he would've liked to have it .
Why should men be more free than women ?
Have I waited so long to see this morning , only to see this ?
That's why your desires are wolfish , bloody , and ravenous .
If that means I don't care about anything , you should disappear right now , since you're nothing .
And there comes Caesar .
I'll look for him and secretly help him .
Are you all crazy ?
I'll get myself a fur-trimmed suit .
I wouldn't allow your enemies to say that , and I won't believe it from you .
No , if you're ever late like this again , I'll refuse to see you .
Love is such a violent emotion that it makes people self-destruct , as much as any strong emotion .
He'd stay up all night and all day if he didn't drink himself to sleep .
That's enough for one lesson .
Farewell , good Salisbury ; and may good luck go with you .
But we can talk more about that tomorrow , when we'll discuss matters of state that concern us both .
No , by Saint Jamy , I'll bet you a penny !
Besides , you're a sponge !
That's true , they are .
Hello , Tubal .
Yes , but the clerk will never do it , unless he grows up to be a man .
He's hiding out in Friar Lawrence's cell .
Well , good-bye , Portia .
But if he's resistant and chilly , then be like that too and break off the conversation .
Draw your sword and give me enough blows to kill me .
Where should we go ?
What you were afraid of has happened .
And since I wooed her in your name , I'll join you in disgracing her .
Yes , I'll say it again , my lord .
Why are you leaving , my angry friend ?
They eat too much and get indigestion and nausea .
I'm sorry I was so wrong about him .
By God , I'll go after him again and beat him up .
I think you're denying what you really are .
I beg you to let me go .
The work we enjoy is not really work .
Set down your honorable load , men , if there is ever any honor in being dead .
Come on , kill me and brag about it !
Will he bring his army ?
Clever lies .
You seem to think no one outside of your bedroom knows what you wish .
With patience , noble lord , as prisoners must .
Oh , my lord , when wisdom and passion are in one body , it's ten to one that the passion will win .
If you're my friend , tell me what you're thinking .
Boatswain !
Oh angels , protect us !
Where , good Miss Mary ?
But God forbid he says no to us !
No , no , he's dead .
Is this well done ?
Is this the kind of world where we hide our accomplishments ?
Lighten up .
You will listen to me .
Oh , I wish I could make a My soul is calling out my name .
A wise man and a fool .
There must be something in the air here .
Play me some music .
The gods forbid !
Yes , one , and this is how I did it .
He's been captured or killed .
It's too bad some mutual friend of theirs doesn't introduce them .
Make him think you're Sir Topas the priest .
Often , when I'm dulled by worry and melancholy , he lightens my mood with his merry pranks .
What's this all about ?
What's going on here , general ?
I would've been a sore king then .
Give me the death sentence and end all my troubles .
What Tranio did , he did at my command .
Which of these bad things happened to him ?
Are you a man ?
What an enormous thing for us to forget ! , Edmund , tell us , where's the king ?
Well , you have given me great comfort .
They're very anxious for you to get there .
What's going on , my lord ?
It's as strange as this other thing which I don't understand .
I'm not as happy as I seem .
Hurry up , Audrey , hurry. , I'm coming , I'm coming .
Sir , your description of him doesn't detract from his good qualities , though I know that trying to list them all would make your head spin , and even so you wouldn't be able to keep up with him .
Cassio's not dead ?
I was born and raised less than three hours from here .
How's the queen ?
Who's that at the gate , uncle ?
So that means she'll come .
You killed this king , didn't you ?
I've brought him a present .
I will .
Who calls so coldly ?
What did you say ?
If not , I'll challenge you to a duel .
All the rest of the conspirators acted out of jealousy of great Caesar .
Lock the door .
What , not even to pray ?
He keeps tearing out his white hair , which the blindly raging winds catch up and blow away into nothingness .
You did .
If you have a voice or can make sounds , speak to me .
A little bit of grief shows a lot of love .
I'll debate this with you later , and then I'll teach you to listen more carefully .
Many of you own slaves , which , like your donkeys and dogs and mules , you use to perform awful jobs just because you bought them .
Don't give him time to catch his breath .
So what ?
murder !
Then you really are insane , if you're no saner than a fool .
My lord , you used to like me .
Othello , have one of your officers stay behind to bring you your commission and whatever else is important to you .
Then God be praised , it Petruchio , do whatever you like .
I hope this play is well cast now .
Here comes Sir Toby , limping .
Are you the lady of the house ?
Now , Signior Petruchio , how are you getting on with my daughter ?
The source from which your royal blood comes has been stopped .
Yes , a little too sweet .
Macbeth !
Yes , it's me .
You should know that I think you're a smart man .
So , in God's name , let's march .
Goodbye .
Grandmother , this would have been a biting joke .
Go ahead and write it down .
Listen , in books they say that true love always faces obstacles .
You lie .
Assemble our squadrons on the other side of the hill , in sight of Caesar's navy .
Well , the difference of a horse !
See , I've sealed his fate with this mark next to his name .
Then you can hear my news , as dessert .
Follow me if you're brave enough , and we'll fight over Helena .
Will you abandon her ?
No , no , I'm as ugly as a bear , since animals that see me run away in terror .
Where is my mother ?
If you go outside , arm yourself .
Where have you been , sister ?
Do you have anything else to tell me ?
Oh , Isis , that's impossible .
You might as well do the impossible rather than try to soften his Jewish heart .
It's too bad that Antony's fault should make you look like a jerk .
God defend and guard us innocents against them !
Pay attention .
What does he look like , Biondello ?
If this letter doesn't make him fight , I don't know what will .
Away , away , be gone .
Beware of the devil .
Ah , revenge !
That's right , except for the widow Dido .
Oh life !
I swear , old fools become like babies again .
What time is it ?
Here are the rulers of France and Burgundy , my lord .
Good-bye .
If this young gentleman has offended you , I'll take the blame for it .
Have I lost my wit ?
I've been looking all over for you .
This is as bad as the tortures of hell .
They call us drunks and insult our noble titles .
I'm a fool. , Let's go , Lorenzo. , Goodbye for now .
Why "let it strike" ?
Come on , my dear Greek philosopher .
Yoo-hoo !
By Isis , I'll give you bloody teeth if you ever compare Caesar with Antony , my best man among men .
I'm only crazy sometimes .
Will they stop working when their voices mature ?
Farewell .
He won't fight with me , Domitius ?
What happened , general ?
No , I don't , sir .
If they could purge their guilt simply by saying that they were innocent , they'd all be as innocent as God Himself .
Welcome .
Did you find my daughter ?
I'll help you , Sir Toby .
Didn't this frighten our captains , Macbeth and Banquo ?
Some Now listen , either give me my ring or give me the necklace .
Where is he ?
You have the sacred power to cure both of us .
Hail !
Well then , I'll say this quickly : the valiant Paris wants you as his bride .
Den it shall also content me .
And he's not going to do any tomorrow .
My mind is too great for that .
Macbeth will never be defeated until Birnam Wood marches to fight you at Dunsinane Hill .
Where could I have lost that handkerchief , Emilia ?
Where am I going ?
Let their beds be as soft as yours , and let them eat the same food as you" ?
Caesar ?
Good morning , Catesby .
It's your turn now .
Please avoid doing that .
I'll get him to come here , and you can ask him yourself .
To the Forest of Arden , to find your father .
The nasty devil's biting my butt .
Not at all !
The queen your mother is upset , and sent me to see you .
In that case I'm afraid you're damned by both your father and your mother .
Take him away !
It would please him very much if you would rely on his wealth and success to support you .
It's a cup , closed in my true love's hand ?
I should go to the barber's , monsieur , because I think I'm getting really hairy around the face .
He picked out the letter "G" from the alphabet and said a wizard told him that "G" will take the throne away from his children .
Doesn't she realize how unworthy she is of the gentleman we have found to be her bridegroom ?
Anyway , Jessica , go inside .
Don't bother us up here .
I know I ought to obey my husband , but not now .
I'm going to stand so I can see him pass on the way to the Capitol .
Thankfully , we have reason to cool our raging lusts .
He can't possibly be such a monster , And I'm sure he isn't .
When evil is dominant , death soon kills the body like cancer .
No , wait .
You're not as close to death as you think you are .
Why , who's so stupid that he can't see through this fraud ?
Come here , Leonato .
Farewell , lady .
My niece , you are welcome here as if you were my own daughter .
I once wrote a sonnet in his praise which began , "Wonder of nature , " I have heard a sonnet to one's mistress that began like that .
And this is the man who has now become a god , and I'm a wretched creature who must bow down if Caesar so much as carelessly nods my way .
I'm afraid to think how I'll be criticized for letting my natural affection for my father give way to my loyalty to you .
Mistress , think about your end , beware of your death !
Tell me why , if you can .
So please , old friend , give us some good advice .
Was he pale or flushed and red-faced ?
Well , I can not tell how my difficult life has weathered my face , but I will never let those difficulties subdue my courage .
Bring them right in .
Be quick .
I'm indebted to you .
Your mother's name has become a threat to her own children .
They're all welcome .
Because who is this man they follow ?
But I'll open the curtain and let you see the picture .
He doesn't know he's been appointed governor yet .
I can't admit that , since you'd have to compare his excellence to mine .
It's better to be the person who gets murdered than to be the killer and be tormented with anxiety .
Not true , not true .
You stupid fool !
You won't be seeing anything. , Hold his chair still , men. , I'm going to put my foot on his eyes .
Take me .
He speaks bluntly , madam .
Please allow her to do this .
Death , which has taken her away to make me cry , now ties up my tongue and won't let me speak .
Oh , heaven help me !
Poison , I see , has been the cause of his death .
They made him drink the leftover wine usually given to the poor .
Tyrant , show your face !
Let's stay and watch .
I told him you were sick .
What a poor , gullible monster. , That was a nice big gulp , monster !
Oh , heaven , how did she get out ?
She's wise , if I'm judging her right .
And I think this is his house .
Not for Cadwallader and all his goats .
It's strongest in the strongest people .
Partly to confirm my opinion and partly for the satisfaction , see , of my mind , with respect to the demands of proper military practice , that's the point ?
Why , what's the matter ?
Give it to me .
Does it mean being truthful ?
If you were ever yourself , and this sadness was yours , you and your sadness were all for Rosaline .
I admit it doesn't look that way to me , and the fact that you suspect me shows that you're smart .
Why did you leave me alone so unkindly ?
For God's sake , sir , you've been robbed .
A prison like that would give me enough liberty .
Later , in a better world than this , I'd love to get to know you .
What do you say ?
Signior Angelo , please excuse us .
Good husband , come home soon .
Our country weeps , it bleeds , and each day a fresh cut is added to her wounds .
Romeo ?
In that case it's like the words of an unpaid lawyer .
Come sit on me .
Oh , my good master !
And there's another storm brewing , I can hear it in the way the wind whistles .
It seems to me that your voice has changed , and that your speech is more elegant than it used to be .
Sadness and despair !
The more I love him , the more he hates me .
Armed , sir .
But don't do that .
Sin from my lips ?
But I will tell you this very plainly : I have challenged Claudio , and either he'll accept the challenge or admit he's a coward .
You'll be lord of the island then , and I'll be your servant .
Well , we almost fought and then realized that we had reached the seventh cause .
Come with me tonight , and you'll see a man enter her bedroom chamber , even tonight , the night before her wedding .
My husband !
You'd better bring the messenger safely through the lines so he can return .
Well , I'm going to break in .
They killed your wife , your children , your servants , anyone they could find .
You can stand in his place .
Whichever of you acts shy , I'll swear she has corns .
Her father is Baptista Minola , a pleasant and courteous gentleman .
You weren't given any gold ?
I , fight against you , Antony ?
We'll drive them to a
Has it been decided that Richard will be It's been decided , though not yet officially announced .
I'd rather have a handful or two of dried peas .
This is a nasty night to go swimming .
When I reach the place he's calling from , he disappears .
Just do it carefully. , And to think that the noble and loyal Kent has been banished , for the crime of telling the truth !
That's true , sir .
Until Birnam Wood gets up and moves to Dunsinane , I won't be affected by fear .
You , good friend , save me a piece of marzipan , and if you love me , have the porter let in Susan Grindstone and Nell .
Tonight she is shut up in her room , alone with her sadness .
Follow them , please .
He followed you .
I wouldn't do that for the whole wide world .
And that would get us all executed .
I loved one speech in particular .
I'll write to my sister and tell her my plans .
Your attendant asses are getting the horses ready .
Just send him here , and I'll persuade him .
You don't know what money can buy .
And as for my soul , how can the ghost endanger that , since it's as immortal as the ghost is ?
Good sir , calm down .
Tranio got you that time .
You didn't give me any gold .
Come , Ariel , I summon you with a thought .
Truthfully , my name is Cinna .
Make sure the ones who have wronged you suffer too .
Why ?
But please forgive me , darling , for the sake of the vows we made to each other so recently .
We have to give up and let him go .
I ordered that the sleeves be cut out and sewed up again , and I'll prove it in combat even if your little finger is armed with your thimble .
The devil must be behind this .
Now , I'll begin : first , we came down a steep hill , my master riding behind my mistress , Both on one horse ?
Who's in there ?
It's not lost , but what if it were ?
You're talking in such a crazy way , sir .
Tell her my love is purer than anything else in the whole world , and has nothing to do with her property .
From now until then seems like twenty years .
Then everything must really be finished .
You never heard of the Centaur ?
I hope what she's saying is well , sir !
What kind of loyalty is this ?
What , are you trying to make me crazy ?
And servants of the Danish king .
If our secret's known , either Caesar or I will die , for I'll kill myself .
Yes , on land you do outnumber me .
Oh , you lowlife !
My soul and not my child !
If not , to tell you I will die is true , but not for love , by God .
Yes , madam .
Worse and worse !
A deed that will make sick men healthy .
Well , time will tell .
I know the king and queen sent for you .
It's easy to get Desdemona on your side .
Sir , sir , calm down .
Since he has the jewel I loved , which you swore you'd keep forever , I'll be as generous as you were to him .
He is a gentleman of a good family , and for his ransom , he will give you two hundred crowns .
I'll bite you on the ear for that joke .
Stay where you are .
Let me know .
No , my lord , that was me .
If we're like you in everything else , we'll resemble you in that respect .
You can give good news in many ways , but let bad news interpret itself as you tell it .
Charles did the same to the second brother , and the third .
I will not take it .
Don't be sad that this happened because of you , because Lady Luck's been nicer to me than usual .
She will purchase that peace with an everlasting war .
Who's that calling so loud ?
And when I told you he was involved the whole time I was trying to get Desdemona , you were like , "Oh , really ? " And then you frowned and wrinkled up your forehead as if you were imagining something horrible .
She's alive .
They're wise and honorable , and will no doubt give you reasons for it .
A woman who doesn't know how to make her own indiscretions look like her husband's fault is hardly a woman .
Hello and God bless you , sir .
Girls , girls !
I know how Too light for a lout like you to catch , though no lighter than I should be .
Tonight we'll wander through the streets and observe the people .
Don't you have any brothers like you ?
We'll go to the river .
Follow my mother .
Yes , my good lord .
Passionate" ?
There's no clock here in the forest .
I'm learning every hour how to be subservient .
Well , good night .
Do you like her , Claudio ?
If that's the case , tears wash my eyes more than hers .
For besides the good news , we are also celebrating his marriage .
And yesterday the night owl sat hooting and shrieking in the marketplace at noon .
How could he have even entertained these thoughts in his heart ?
I can only do it by lying , my lord , but I can do it so secretly that no one will suspect me .
But that is a false conclusion , since we have locks to keep our valuables safe and clever traps to catch little thieves .
You don't know me .
They shout for joy .
If you're lying , I'll hang you alive from the nearest tree until you die of hunger .
A very candid reply .
I put those wedding sheets on your bed , as you asked .
The friar's ready .
I don't know .
So , sir .
I'm making a kind offer , zero percent financing .
It's too small for your large mind .
Go , hurry .
Oh , you streetwalker !
I'm listening to you only because I've got nothing better to do .
I feel a lot better after talking to this guy .
But go away now .
Ah , soldier !
Lady Luck is a fickle whore And never gives the poor a break .
I repeat , spread the rumor that Anne , my wife , is sick and likely to die .
Now , fellow , what have you got there ?
Order him to advance his forces first thing , and we'll follow .
Noble Mercutio , put your sword away .
I didn't say free , madam .
Maybe some merchant at the marketplace invited him home for lunch .
If you can prove that I'll ever be so in love that I can't be brought to my senses with a good round of beers , you can pluck out my eyes with a love-poet's pen and hang me on a brothel's door where the picture of blind Cupid usually goes .
Next month he'll stay with us .
Still , Edmund was beloved .
I assure you it is , madam .
For eighty-one weeks he will waste away in agony .
You coward , did you run away from me ?
I'm killing myself with this provocative speculation.. .
Leave me alone , Desdemona , go away !
I don't think a ridiculous Pyramus like that one deserves much moaning .
You're getting too angry .
I made you de facto rulers of my kingdom on condition that I could keep a hundred knights of my own .
Stop whining , devil .
Take your time .
What's this ?
I'm being called .
So do all thoughts .
That sounds like the voice of Friar John .
Here , take the ring .
Where do you live ?
Hello , Curan .
Should I say to you , "Set them free !
It was about to say something when the rooster crowed .
No , because we shouldn't be doing that , stuff .
Once there , make your thoughts work harder , and witness a siege .
Look !
I would not .
I don't dare come down , forgive me , my lord , I don't dare , for fear of capture .
Oh , Tranio , until it happened to me , I never would have thought it possible .
Who's shouting ?
How sound asleep she is !
Heaven knows .
The one who claims to be your wife just ran away from you .
Cast spells with them , and "Brutus" will call up a ghost as well as "Caesar." Now , in the name of all the gods , I ask you what food does Caesar eat that has made him grow so great ?
We'll do what you want us to , my lord .
It's bitterly cold out , and I'm depressed .
Oh , the sixpence you gave me last Wednesday to buy leather goods for my mistress ?
I pitied you , worked hard to teach you to speak , and taught you some new thing practically every hour .
And so far I'm pleased with the way things have turned out , since I find all of this commotion very entertaining .
I'll be right next to you .
You need to .
Then tomorrow at dinner ?
No , you have to forget all that now .
Nothing can be made out of nothing .
Two or three more lords and ladies have been married too .
I'm not a paid messenger , my lady .
Hortensio , have you come to break up the fight ?
What ?
Here's something good .
Whose tongue ?
His military understanding is all theory , no practice .
Oh , only time can sort out this mess .
I'll meet all your attacks , even if you come charging at me with a lance at full gallop .
Don't worry about me .
Sure , and twenty others just like you .
I enjoyed a sweeter rest than sleep .
Rise , princes , and , with a spirit of honor more sharply edged than your swords , rush to the battlefield : Charles Delabreth , High Constable of France ; you dukes of Orleans , Bourbon , Berri , Alencon , Brabant , Bar , and Burgundy ; Jaques Chatillon , Rambures , Vaudemont , Beaumont , Grandpre , Roussi , and Fauconberg , Foix , Lestrale , Bouciqualt , and Charolois .
I heard that Julius Caesar got fat from all the feasting there .
Block up my house's ears , I mean the windows .
It's out of fashion to give lengthy explanations like that .
And though I wouldn't dare to swear that you love me , still my blood begins to flatter me that you do , despite the ill effects of my face .
the way trainers do with young hawks that flutter and flap and will not obey .
If he can not , let the tailor mend him .
How old are you , friend ?
I beg your pardon .
I accept that offer happily , madam .
Go to the harbor immediately !
Your Highness just told me that I should ride there before you .
The Bishop of Ely has fled to Richmond , and Buckingham , backed by a hardy Welsh army , is on the march .
Good words are better than bad strokes , Octavius .
At your service , madam .
There was even more foolishness , if I could only remember it .
I'll move to a more open place and there speak to great Caesar as he walks past .
It's time for you to know the whole story .
Besides , our hands are hard and calloused .
Pull them apart .
Very true .
Amen to that !
The man who killed Mercutio , which way did he go ?
Rob them of the ability to count before the numbers against them overwhelm their courage .
Give me your hand .
I'm feeling very low , and I need to sleep .
When he regained consciousness again , he said that if he'd done or said anything wrong , he wanted them to know that it was all because of his sickness .
And like I am for Ganymede .
The bridegroom is already here .
Will either of you give him the message that I'm challenging him to a duel ?
Continue , then , and don't forget to perform all of the rituals .
Then I'll really give it to you .
If he's not in love with a woman , then you can't trust the usual symptoms .
Forget about him , Jack !
She's lying on the ground just like him , blubbering and weeping , weeping and blubbering .
Which speech , my lord ?
Sing my praises to your mistress .
The violet smells to him the same as it does to me .
You call this a scale ?
There is no life , but my love is dead !
I'm going to find out what you're thinking .
You're not supposed to get old until you're wise .
I've made my choice .
Am I all alone ?
Stay with us tonight .
Your crown is crooked .
I won't .
Hurry up .
Time travels at different speeds for different people .
Bring him here and ask him .
Here , Peter Quince .
Your wit is too courtly for me .
You're going to pay for this , Roderigo .
Oh , please don't swear , my lord of Buckingham .
I'd be wasting my skills dealing with an idiot like that if I couldn't get something useful out of him .
What's amazing is how long he lasted .
And no doubt he is , gracious madam .
Therefore , by law , you are condemned to die .
It's a lucky sign , isn't it ?
And though his feelings may be pitched higher than ours , when they plummet , they plummet that much farther .
Good Enobarbus , consider yourself my guest as long as you're here .
So everyone goes off into the world except me , who stays in because I'm sunburned .
Her name is Portia .
Well then , improve your situation with a show of courage .
Gentlemen , we won't stay here and anger you further .
That's too long. , Servants , leave her and me alone .
I'll send my prayers with him .
Where's that dog ?
Look at him .
I know she is a hateful , brawling scold .
If you say it isn't true , I'll give you a province and make you rich .
I'll do as you say , father .
I was an idiot to take it !
If you've got any music that can't be heard , then play that .
I wonder what it means .
How can you square things with me ?
I swear on my soul it was a lie .
Well , it's as plain as the beaten path to a parish church .
Ah , leave it alone .
But you would be more honorable if you changed your mind .
Woman , stop your frantic curses and false prophesies before we run out of patience and do something bad to you .
Where is the king ?
And those who leave their valiant bones in France , dying like men though buried in your dunghills , they'll be remembered , too .
My brother thinks highly of you , and because of his affection , has helped arrange your marriage , but that was definitely a waste of his time and energy .
Thieves !
It's just that my wit is very gentlemanly , Margaret , and refuses to hurt a woman .
Come , come .
But one word more , He will not be commanded by you .
There's certainly not a boy left alive , and it was done by the cowardly rascals who were running from the battle .
Then turn your noble face away from me , that face that the whole world adores .
Saw who ?
Labio and Flavio , push our armies onward .
You are very welcome here .
What's she trying to say ?
Antonio , you're under arrest on the orders of Count Orsino .
Why ,
It is .
Come , Vaughan .
Is this the work of an ambitious man ?
And everyone can say "welcome , " which is just a word .
His horse is killed , so he's fighting on foot , risking his life to search out Richmond .
Was this ambition ?
This looks like an abbey .
We want to hear it , Antony .
What do you want to tell me ?
She flirted with the messenger boy to exasperate you , fire up your passions , and make you angry and jealous .
I have to tell you , I thought you were a much kinder person than this .
And now who but you knows whether I'm yours ?
Hurry to a convent .
Isn't that him on the ground ?
What a backward world we live in !
It's worse than murder to humiliate a king's messenger like this .
Oh , noise ?
You should mock me I wish I were invisible , so I could grab that strong fellow by the leg .
Oh , Antony , don't beg us to kill you .
Would you rather that Caesar were living and we would all go to our graves as slaves , or that Caesar were dead and we all lived as free men ?
And they've got their swords unsheathed !
What news , man ?
My mistress here lies murdered in her bed , No , heaven forbid !
Oh , sir , you are too good at predicting the future .
But brother , I have some strange news for you .
Go to Francis Seacole , the constable of the watch .
Sir , such a life with such a wife is unlikely !
But you'll have to catch me !
What are you doing here in Elsinore ?
Where is he , in his bed ?
Okay , now it starts !
He's going senile .
Since I can't amuse myself by being a lover , I've decided to become a villain .
There'd be no kingship , He wants to be king in a place with no kingship .
He loves to hear me tell him how men can be snared by flatterers , just like unicorns can be captured in trees , elephants in holes , and lions with nets .
Well then , you have good reason to be sad .
I'll be with you right away .
Who can explain this to me ?
If I'm a wasp , look out for my stinger .
No ?
Oh cousin , cousin !
Oh , was she now ?
I'm coming , I'm coming !
Some achieve greatness , " What are you saying ?
Three words , dear Romeo , and then it's good night for real .
Oh cowardly conscience , how you're torturing me !
Who asked you to call her ?
Do you love me ?
I can't find anyone who saw her leave .
If you do that , I'll never respect you again .
Do you know him ?
What's that noise ?
Horny animals !
There are reasons and causes why and how in everything .
She told my mother that as long as she kept it with her , my father would love and desire her .
It's too late to go to bed now .
Oh , and then at the very next turn , don't turn left or right , but turn down and around to the Jew's house .
No , my friends , don't please fate by giving it your sorrow as well .
It is .
I'll remember .
Looking just like the dead king .
Didn't you send Lysander , as an insult , to follow me around praising my eyes and my face ?
Sweet Moon , I thank you for your sunny beams .
Who's been with her ?
It's as all-consuming and insatiable as the sea , and it can swallow as much as the sea can .
I swear I will never break this promise of love .
And that's all there is to it .
No , ma'am .
Will you be patient ?
Or Tuesday noon or at night , or Wednesday morning .
Come back to my house with me .
Now , if courtiers were shepherds , that kind of courtesy would be unclean .
He's a good man. , Let's go , Desdemona .
If luck's with me , I'll lose a father , and you'll lose a daughter .
Edward Plantagenet , why are you dead ?
And I am your Rosalind .
What do you mean by all this ?
I'm glad you've come , father .
No , come back , Kate .
Who are you ?
Iago .
Welcome , Publius .
I believe your Honor is thinking of a character called Soto .
Then lay that sentence on me too , my lord .
Right away , Caesar .
Truly , lady , you have a merry heart .
I doubt you'd thank me in the end , but she's rich , all right , very rich .
We haven't even talked about who'll be our torchbearers .
Why are you treating my sister like this ?
Sir , it's the Moor .
Why , our troops amount to three times that .
Dear God , please make him normal again !
We'll come with you , your Grace .
Tell me , if your dark powers can see this far : will Banquo's sons ever reign in this kingdom ?
Let's shake on it .
But tell me what you're fighting about .
Never .
We can all go together .
Once , on a cold and windy day , when the river Tiber was crashing against its banks , Caesar said to me , "Cassius , I dare you to jump into this rough water with me and swim to that point there." As soon as he spoke , though I was fully dressed , I plunged in and called for him to follow .
Yes , dear madam .
What could I say , my dear ?
Yet he seems capable .
Someone adored me once , too .
Her name is Katherina Minola , famous throughout Padua for her scolding tongue .
Look with your ears .
Send a message to his brother .
But I'm running ahead of myself .
Attack the breach in the city wall once more , dear friends , attack it once more , or else let's close it up with English corpses .
I'm afraid that may be the case , madam .
Is it my mother ?
Halfway down the cliff there's somebody clinging to the rock and gathering wild herbs , a risky business !
If we'd fought like this before , we'd have driven them home with bandaged heads .
With all my heart , I give you that thing which , if you didn't already have it , I'd try with all my heart to keep from you .
That island of England breeds very valiant creatures .
I'm going to make you a rich man .
Who was it ?
I can see what's in broad daylight .
Antonio !
Come on , Nerissa , I want to go see this man who's come so courteously .
I heard him groan , yes , I did , and the same tongue that ordered the Romans to obey him and transcribe his speeches in their books cried , "Give me some water , Titinius , " like a sick girl .
It is "music with her silver sound , " because musicians have no gold to use to make sounds .
Gracious Lord , blunt the swords of those traitors who mean to tear poor England apart again !
No more than I do yours .
If they're not honest , they shouldn't look like they are !
Have you written that down , that they aren't criminals ?
Do they come from good families ?
That's what you'll say once you've seen part two .
He's not jealous ?
I do .
But I guess it doesn't matter .
It's true , my lords , he did .
I don't know why he's come here .
Are you all good and honest men ?
As I neglected practical matters , being totally dedicated to solitude and to improving my mind with subjects more valuable than most people imagine , I was so shut away from the world that I unwittingly stirred up evil wishes in my disloyal brother .
Listen to him talk about war , and you'll hear elegant and thrilling accounts of the battles .
What have you done ?
Never , my lord .
What's your name , please , friend ?
That was nothing .
Come on .
He's eager to see your head .
So go ahead and have your terrifying fun .
We'll write it in alternating eight- and six-syllable lines , just like in a ballad .
What can we do to find out if it's true ?
My mistress Titania is in love with a monster .
Who's this ?
Then , like prophets , they named him the father to a line of kings .
I'll bite my thumb at them .
What woman wouldn't be distressed , being lorded over by a handful of dust ?
Oh , on my soul , my cousin has been slandered falsely !
My sweet Cassio !
Wise men who give fools money might get a good reputation , if they keep up regular payments for fourteen years .
She's only sad when she sleeps , and not even then .
Which plays , what music ?
Because you're like the lowborn fellow who strikes the bell , you keep interrupting my thoughts .
What a fearful night this is !
There's music coming out of thin air .
Good day , Catesby .
No , someone has to give her away or the marriage isn't legal .
In ten days time , if you're found within twenty miles of the court , you'll die for it .
Read it instantly .
Give me my armor .
The gold I gave Dromio is safe and sound at the Centaur , and the inn host says that Dromio has left and is looking for me .
I'll beat him despite his fancy fencing techniques and all the practicing he does , despite his youth and manliness .
That's how flimsy and unreal pleasure is .
No more talk about killing yourself , okay ?
Whip him !
No , he's not .
Romeo , get out of here .
What do you think of his neighbor , the Scottish lord ?
His youngest daughter , the beautiful Bianca , is the jewel of my life , and he keeps her hidden away from me and other rivals for her hand .
Is it now afternoon ?
What traitor hears me and doesn't say amen ?
Then how will we see their own natural tears ?
Well , let's have it , Grumio .
But now , I tell you , keep it to yourself , though , those enemies of mine are being put to death today , and I'm better than I've ever been .
Who's that coming ?
Come on , you're fooling yourself .
I seek no revenge for myself , but so dearly do I hold the safety of my kingdom , which you sought to destroy , that you must be punished according to her laws .
Paying debts is for peasants .
You're defending an impostor ?
As for me , I'll leave when I like .
Let him come in .
But our courage should only be the greater for that .
If I were in England now , like I was once , and I had even a painted picture of this fish , every fool there would give me a piece of silver to look at it .
Isn't it strange , Canidius , that he could cross the Ionian Sea so quickly from Tarentum and Brundusium and take Toryne ? , Have you heard about this , sweet ?
Suffer love !
Let me tell you , my friend , I'm almost insane myself .
Do you think you've got a couple of fools on your hands here ?
A million goodbyes to you .
But I'll see you soon .
But insincere men , like horses who are too lively at the start of a race , make a big show of their spirit .
I'm finished .
What is a traitor ?
Then I will kiss your lips , Kate .
Herald , spare yourself .
You can't have anything but the penalty , to be taken at your peril , Jew .
You're right .
Lysander , where are you going with all this ?
Quiet !
It's undeniable .
She's shut inside a dead man's tomb !
My own safety is the only important thing now .
There are things in this comedy of Pyramus and Thisbe that will never work .
Snip and snip and cut and slash , it's got more holes than a sieve !
I'm sure he's out there dancing .
Go to bed right this minute .
Who does time amble for ?
All you English princes , I salute you .
I've seen you bait and mock this man more than once .
Let us leave everything and give our vineyards to the barbarous nation .
We shouldn't have too big a celebration , we can invite a friend or two .
I think this applause is for some new honors awarded to Caesar .
Throw some of your words at me .
You told me to do the same , my liege .
Well , take him on up and we'll try to pull it off .
He looks skinny , like a dried herring without its eggs , and he hasn't got his girl .
If there's any reason we shouldn't get married , I urge you to tell me .
The count is neither sad nor sick nor cheerful nor well , he's just civil , as Seville as an orange , with the same jealous-yellow complexion .
Anyway , even if he had the money now , the Jew probably wouldn't take it .
Now , I swear by Apollo, By Apollo , King , you're taking the names of the gods in vain .
Yes , my lord .
No I won't , even if you were one of the worst demons in hell .
No , longer than that .
You too , Fabian .
It's an outstanding army and highly motivated .
Of what city , may I ask ?
Well , well .
Tell the army to flee .
Rage on , blow !
I don't like your faults .
Angels are still bright even though Lucifer , the brightest angel , fell from heaven .
Please go inside .
Carved it up and down like an apple tart ?
Get me some ink and paper , and hire some horses to ride .
Come on , my lord .
Look , here's the necklace .
Who deserted this morning ?
Tell me again , where did you leave those lowlifes ?
Since the youth won't be reasoned with , he'll have to suffer for his stubbornness .
I'll tell them that we won't hurt anyone with our swords , and that Pyramus isn't really dead .
So much for Fortinbras .
You've pierced me through the heart with your cruelty , and yet you , the murderer , look as bright and clear as a star in the sky .
Ah sir , ah sir .
But wait , what's that sound ?
March to meet him at a dignified pace .
The one who plays the part of the king will be particularly welcome .
What business is it of yours ? , Father , be quiet .
Neither will I .
Wasn't he friends with all those brawling knights who serve my father ?
What do you think ?
Hello , beautiful Helena !
Oh , I wish she knew how much I love her .
My husband will save me .
The prince has done neither ; therefore , in my opinion , he isn't really protected by sanctuary .
Stand up .
Tubal , a wealthy Jew I know , will supply me with the cash .
He's a fool , a madman , and a drowned man .
I did .
The rooster has already crowed twice .
I did them for Edward's sake , and look how he rewards me. , Oh God , if my prayers don't satisfy you , and you have to avenge the wrongs I've done , at least punish me alone !
Here was a Caesar !
What further pain must I endure in my old age ?
Can you bring me to him ?
God bless you , Bottom , God bless you .
And our drunkenness does detract from our achievements , as great as they are , and lessens our reputations .
Some people say that the earth shook as if it had a fever .
There will be no lecture .
But wait , there's some prose after her poem .
That's music to my ears .
You'll know about that later .
Come , let's continue on toward your father's house .
Would you like to taste the banquet ?
Poor Tom , your cup is empty .
If you tickle us , don't we laugh ?
Didn't I ?
This is just what the letter said .
Sir , he's with Caesar .
Where is my page ?
How are you , Guildenstern ?
Goodbye , my husband .
I don't understand , how should I answer that ?
And what is that music ?
What do you say to a calf's foot ?
Get out of my sight ! , Dear Cesario , please don't be offended. , Get out of here , you barbarian !
Now that he's old , we can expect to have to deal not only with his old character flaws , which have turned into deep-rooted habits , but also with the uncontrollable crabbiness that comes with old age .
Ha , ha , ha !
I will , madam .
Don't take Helena's side .
Give me my veil .
The French have retreated , see , and there were great acts of courage .
Now , herald , have the dead been counted ?
I know you'll offer nothing less than that .
Why do you care that he loves Hermia ?
Hastings and Edward's children , Rivers and Grey , holy King Henry and your fine son Edward , Vaughan , and all who have died from underhanded , corrupt , fiendish injustice , if your angry souls are witnessing this moment through the clouds , enjoy the revenge , laugh at my ruin !
At his best he's a little less than a man , and at his worst he's little more than an animal .
I don't know how to ask you for forgiveness , but I have to say something .
No , it's just after twelve ; I heard the clock strike .
What have you done ?
I'll make ground beef out of you .
Oh , look !
She sees you with the eyes my daughter lent her , it's true .
Enough , gentlemen .
Why should I now have to make do with only twenty-five ?
As I was working on one musty room , the Prince and Claudio entered .
But I didn't want to be free like this .
Signed , The poorly treated Malvolio." Did he write this ?
Oh no , sir , I won't let him go , sir , not without a good reason .
I'm leaving your court now .
Give my regards to your lady , and tell her to hurry everybody in the house to bed .
It's like half your soul's been ripped out .
This is amazing .
I like to pretend you are , because then it's almost like actually talking to her .
You look like a person who knows the business of war .
When the day comes , I'll wish it were nighttime , so I could sleep with the legal expert's clerk .
Bassanio , the best thing you can do is to keep living and write an epitaph for my gravestone .
Goodbye .
You can decide that privately .
Then see the evidence of their evil with your own eyes .
Second , he must make a will here in this court that leaves all his property to his son-in-law Lorenzo and his daughter when he dies .
It's a villain and a bastard and a coward and a rascal .
Out here everybody can see us .
Whatever we decide to do .
I'll get back at him another way .
Not true .
Ding , dong , bell .
You look angry .
Excellent !
I'm going to forget my duties to you a little bit and complain about the injuries you've caused me .
But on the prettiest branches Or at the end of every sentence I'll write "Rosalinda , " Teaching everyone who can read that the essence of every spirit Is contained in this one woman .
Return to the gracious duke , good Catesby .
There's very little about her that's gloomy , my lord .
Sir , do you know who I am ?
Every old man has worries , and worried men never get any sleep , but young men shouldn't have a care in the world .
He's honest , he's got to speak the truth .
Let the gods judge me !
Someday you can get revenge. , Oh , you bastard !
Let's move again , my friends .
Too bad it fell flat .
Now , if that's true , and it's obviously true , who's in a better position than Cassio ?
I am not some fiend of hell : you can't get rid of me with spells .
Are you good or evil ?
Are you crazy ?
Call the priest .
I've been alive for twenty-eight years , and I've never met a man who knew what was good for him .
Live , and from now on , say a madman mercifully told you to run away .
Why the nobles were imprisoned , and on what charges , I don't know , my gracious lord .
Go forward .
Ah , how pitiful !
Me , "greedy" !
And if he advances unopposed , my lord , let us abandon France .
Lead the way , sir .
I think few die well who die in battle .
You seem all right now .
A virtuous woman won't give her husband horns , and my Rosalind is definitely virtuous .
My honor wasn't given ; it was only dominated .
On Thursday , sir ?
Then if he loses , it'll be his swan song , music before the end .
More , please , more .
These revelations have overwhelmed her .
Let's call for help and get them tied up again !
He's somewhere else in the house .
I'll do everything I can for you , Cassio .
How are things going now ?
Not yet." Well , the time has come .
You're giving him a present ?
If we meet him at Philippi , these people will be at our backs .
He did , and he snatched my ring right off my finger .
The Turks are heading for Cyprus with a powerful fleet .
Here come the lovers , laughing happily. , I wish you joy , my friends !
We have kissed away entire kingdoms and provinces .
Put your straw hats on , have some fun , and dance with these young nymphs .
Have a safe trip .
He started it , my noble lord , and succeeding generations rebuilt it .
Corporal Nym , be a man and put away your sword .
And your father was Duke of Milan , and you were his heir , a princess .
But sir , have you married my daughter without my consent ?
I will allow you one day to look for help in Ephesus .
Repent and avoid damnation .
I've already sent the proof in my letters .
His son was a minor only two years ago .
Either go someplace private , or talk it over rationally , or else just go away .
Ah , it's a sensitive animal , with a good conscience .
Where is he staying ?
My good King , surprise the English and let them know what kind of kingdom you rule over .
Now it's time to get your costumes together .
I said you had a fine wit .
You stay on the left .
We're safe from my father for at least three hours .
Definitely a tailor , sir .
I really think it was him .
Is there anything else I can do for you ?
The general got rid of us early tonight so he could be with Desdemona. , I can't blame him .
But no more spooky visions ! , Where are the messengers ?
Anyway , what should we do ?
Three miles from here you can see it coming , a moving forest .
Me too .
Mistress , you have to go see your father .
Princes and counts !
Draw your sword , scoundrel .
It looks like a day when the sun is hidden .
Got it , sir .
A grave ?
So we should eat and drink .
As absolute a traitor as any in the whole entire world , or even France or England !
God give you joy , Petruchio .
Give her this key , and tell her that there's money in the desk that's covered with a Turkish tapestry .
Contagious infection of humanity , give me a chance to condemn you for the evils I know you've committed .
Don't you recognize me , father ?
My good lord , You've always been a liar .
Well , to wear out their shoes and get myself more work .
Come with me , please .
Another thing , Domitius : Antony wants to see you now .
We'll see our husbands before they even have a chance to miss us .
Well , then , I hope he chokes on it !
Another studpid answer !
Good. , Now come , Ariel !
Even if we said that this behavior suits him , though only a man with a perfect character could avoid being disgraced by such antics , there's no excuse for the extra work we've had to take on while he's been off amusing himself .
As his body grows uglier with age , his mind rots away as well .
Marry her as you should have married her cousin , and I will let my revenge die .
Either my eyes deceive me , or I see two husbands .
A messenger has arrived from Caesar .
Because we were unprepared for the king's visit , we weren't able to entertain him as well as we would have wanted to .
Merciful heaven !
We'll send Mark Antony to the senate house , and he'll say that you're sick today .
How does it go with my magnificent Mark Antony ?
There is a river in Macedon , and there is likewise a river in Monmouth .
What did he do to you ?
My sister is all those things , or else she should be .
Promising favors ?
Where's Romeo ?
When you find out who started this disagreement , turn your anger upon them .
jailer , i'm your prisoner .
You taught me language , and all I can do with it is curse .
I have sent for the strawberries .
Where that "sweetheart" said I was her husband !
Wake up , I say !
What , an argument already ?
Here's some more news coming in .
Not young enough to fall in love with a woman because she sings well , but not old enough to dote on a woman for any reason .
The problem is that they have to compete with a group of children who yell out their lines and receive outrageous applause for it .
What , he never made you laugh ?
I'll recognize him all right , I'm sure of it .
Yes , with Cassio .
Or am I asleep now and imagining all this ?
A friend should put up with his friend's weaknesses , but you exaggerate mine .
We're three of them .
There we go !
Hail !
That's how sound a man you appeared .
Maybe you'll see some little trinket you want to buy .
If he is , that's his problem .
I've heard my father mention him .
Whenever they meet , there's a little battle .
I hope I never achieve success if I don't feel some of your heartbroken grief right now .
She I can guess her answer .
No , it's Casca , someone who's going to work with us .
Bad people can't appreciate wisdom or goodness .
But I haven't eaten anything yet .
Dress me up in motley .
There's meaning in your snoring .
If you're going to lend us this money , don't lend it to us as if we were your friends .
When he's there next time , I'll send my daughter to see him .
Who's dead ?
I hope we have the time some day !
They're like stomachs and we're just the food .
Flies can kiss her , but I must flee the city .
Yes , kind sister .
I admit two sleeves .
This morning , they've flown away and in their place are ravens , crows , and kites , flying over our heads and looking down on us , as though we were sickly prey .
Today was the day I breathed my first breath .
Oh , go away !
No , I'd rather you stayed here .
Let's go up to the castle .
The gentleman she danced with told her you insulted her .
Yawn , snore .
Yes , as kind as snow to a harvest .
If you would take the trouble to study the tactics of Pompey the Great , I can tell you that you would find no tittle-tattle or pibble-pabble in Pompey's camp .
The whole time .
He needs to see you right away .
Curse my hand if it ever threatened an old man like you .
Right in the middle of the fight , just when the battle could have gone either way , actually we had a slight advantage , that immoral Egyptian nag , May she die of leprosy ! , suddenly became frightened , and turned her ships around and fled .
Let's not argue here in front of both our armies , which ought to see nothing but love between us .
Here's to your health .
Never .
Calling death banishment is like cutting off my head with a golden ax and smiling while I'm being murdered .
Are you there ?
Hurt him in eleven different places .
What does the silver one say ?
Whoever's a real friend should strike me dead .
She's no longer my daughter , and I'll never see her face again .
Don't laugh at me , but I swear I think this lady is my child Cordelia .
The night has been chaotic .
But who is this ?
They're on the march .
He looks angry .
No ?
I think this country is so kind that if it weren't for
This is all that's left for me to do , but I won't do it .
Lord , how you've changed !
You can see how it is all around .
He woke up the whole house with his loud and cowardly screams .
You'll introduce me to him as a eunuch .
Just ignore him .
Escape and make peace with Caesar .
He cried out , "Wait for me , dear cousin .
Do you have in there the pretty snake of the Nile that kills without pain ?
Well , you know he sometimes walks here in the lobby for four hours at a time .
Right over to that I hope he enjoys her .
Good morning to you both .
Is that a good idea , do you think ?
But who would dare tell her ?
Fabian can hardly control him over there .
Oh , if only I were a man !
But don't expect any more than that .
Our handwriting gives away our hearts .
Thank you , I'm sure .
You'd better go inside .
Let's all sink with the king .
But when I say so , I swear she turns white as a sheet .
That's noble of you , master .
Go to bed , dear .
Hello , everyone !
Where are your tenants and your followers ?
How goes the battle ?
I swear I have no idea why he stopped loving me .
Goodbye , Jessica .
My head is pounding .
I'm indebted to you forever .
We shouldn't make any judgments until we achieve our goal .
I don't understand all dat .
And does this prospect of good fortune make you happy ?
This is a guy who's been praised for his honest bluntness , and who now insolently pretends to be plainspoken and twists the natural meanings of words .
From under the earth .
He called me Sebastian .
Oh , Antony !
Let me help you up .
By the end I will either live , or else I'll restore my honor by shedding my blood .
This is not the time for dwelling on personal grievances .
I will kiss your lips .
Then if they're negligent , we could control them .
Iago's a good man .
Yes , madam .
Tell me that .
Orlando .
Sir , my brother is very fond of you .
The poor thing , he is so shaken with a fever that it's terrible to see .
There's nothing like good hay , really sweet hay .
Nurse , give my regards to to your lady .
A man is master of his own freedom : time is his only master , and when the right moment comes along , he'll come or go as he pleases .
Now , madam , undress and come to bed .
For we may take pity on you , even if we can't pardon you .
If my doing what you told me to makes you happy , then be happy , because I did it .
Well , that one , I think , is young Petruchio .
Two unlucky children of these enemy families become lovers and commit suicide .
Go on , get out of here .
If you're as poor a subject as he is a king , you definitely are poor .
Why are you looking at me so strangely ?
I'll go to him .
Is Clarence dead ?
Are you coming again for ransom ?
You're as wise as you are beautiful .
If you take it too seriously , it'll have bad effects that I didn't want it to have .
Are you going ?
That's why I'm worried about you .
And now she'll start moaning , of course , Are you asleep , my love ?
I'm not Cinna the conspirator .
They should get to bed early and get plenty of sleep .
You say the king is losing his mind .
Sure , to a cheap host and an even cheaper guest .
I don't dare , sir .
And anything else ?
About the table , sir , dinner will be served on it .
Let him command me , and I'll do whatever he asks , no matter how violent .
I'll take all who served Brutus into my service .
Hey , bride !
Oh , I could weep my soul right out of myself !
Are you acting so boldly from hardship or because you despise good manners ?
Drink when I order you , servant-monster .
Mister Challenger , the princess wants to speak to you .
Tell me anything you remember .
Do you know why the King of France suddenly went back home ?
It doesn't matter .
Hello , sir .
Did he confess ?
Why do you spit at me ?
I don't like sports .
He would just see me for what I am , a person amazed to hear you talking about Naples .
Let's proceed .
He's the most stubborn dog that ever lived among humans .
He'll stay as long as I say .
This way , my lord .
You will seem even brighter and more virtuous when she's out of the picture .
Listen .
Do you know his plans ?
If we can do that , everything will be all right .
Oh , if you could speak , I might hear you call Caesar an ass who's been outsmarted !
Why , he has an income of three thousand ducats a year .
You're taking a shorter route .
It is for your ears only .
Yes , my good lord .
Why ?
That these crimes are punished so quickly is proof .
She would hang on to him , and the more she was with him the more she wanted to be with him ; she couldn't get enough of him .
The sails were dyed purple , and they were perfumed so heavily that they made the air seem dizzy with love .
If there's anyone in this assembly , any dear friend of Caesar's , I say to him that my love for Caesar was no less than his .
Hush , Grumio .
No , sir , not at all .
While he was still in Rome , he deployed his forces in so many different disguises that all our spies were fooled .
Answer me like men .
If you still love her after that , then marry her tomorrow .
Very near , and approaching fast .
Who ever saw the heavens threaten like this ?
This imaginary suitor for Katherina , I'd buy him the best horse in Padua if he'd get here quickly , woo her , marry her , take her to bed , and rid the house of her .
What features ?
And what will happen if I don't ?
Then Caesar and he will always be united .
Come on , bring them in .
Keep a little bit of honesty , even if you're afraid .
Then that's the way it'll be .
It doesn't matter where , so long as it's not here .
That's the consideration that makes us stretch out our sufferings so long .
Nothing , but this is true .
Only yesterday the word of Caesar might have stood against the world .
That makes Lady Courtesy a traitor .
Gentleness is the only way to go , gently , gently .
Why , what have you done , sweet Beatrice ?
Hey , Nurse !
What , everybody falls asleep so fast ?
I've rented land from you and your father for eighty years .
I see .
You'll fight with a man who's cracking nuts just because you have hazelnut-colored eyes .
There's no way to read a man's mind by looking at his face .
Well , let's get out of here and tell Macbeth what we did accomplish .
Well go on home .
If you took a good look at yourself , or if you thought about this more carefully , your fear would teach you to act more cautiously .
I don't know , sir .
One of you go call the Jew into court here .
Hello , you idiot .
Tongue , do not speak .
I want to go home .
Noses , ears , lips .
You just said all your lines at once , cues and all. , Pyramus , enter .
Poor Tom has been scared out of his mind .
I'll tell twenty lies like that , so men will think I graduated from school at least a year ago .
Good-bye , my dearest sister , good-bye .
He's waiting outside .
Tranio , let's go .
Alas , she has been too long exiled from France , whose crops all lie in heaps , rotting with ripeness .
But she has had prayers read for her and is dressed up like a pure virgin , with flowers tossed on her grave and the bell tolling for her .
Uncle , please give me your dagger .
Speak .
You have amazed me .
Be the person you know you are , and you'll be as powerful as this person you fear .
Go !
Read the will .
That's a good one .
That's how I always do it , getting money from fools .
Why , she was dead before you were even born .
It's Hortensio , isn't it ?
And if anything important happens , find me and let me know .
It may be so .
Oh , Kent , what could I ever do to become as good as you are ?
Brutus , what will we do ?
Let me at him .
Alexas !
Oh , you villain !
Yes , indeed , it was , and he pushed it away three times , each time more gently than the last ; and at each refusal my countrymen shouted .
Did he stare at you ?
I'll prove that I'm an honest man and a man of honor if you dare defend yourself .
I don't know what you're talking about .
Goodbye .
That's a poor example .
M" , why , that's the first letter in my name .
Please don't cry .
Let's act quickly .
His coffers are too poor to atone for our losses , his entire kingdom too small to account for the amount of blood we've shed , and the sight of him kneeling at our feet an empty satisfaction compared to the indignity we have put up with .
Take on someone your own size : if you kill me , boy , you'll have killed a man .
The wind blew down through the chimneys where we were sleeping .
I have no power over you .
Music feeds the melancholy moods of us lovers .
Read your history !
Absolutely , he is stuffed , like a dummy .
I don't care if all the devils in hell crammed together to possess him , I still want to speak to him .
If he's as good as a saint but is black like a devil , I'd rather he hear my confession than marry me .
Thank you , master .
Don't be afraid .
If you leave like this , my dear , I won't ever use my sword again .
Take him away .
Who was that ?
How are you , my friend ?
Helena , we'll tell you about our secret plan .
It's my best option : I can't afford to lose forty ducats .
So order the armies to rest , and let's go home to share the glories of this happy day .
Caesar's talking .
Hurry , hurry , close the curtain quick .
Well , you're a liar , then .
Where are my father and my mother , Nurse ?
There is no jewel like Rosalind .
Once I've put my rackets to these balls , I'll play a set in France , God willing , that will knock his father's crown right out of the court .
That's the way to do it !
More , please , more .
I might do something I'll be sorry for .
With crisscrossed laces ?
Shall we call in the ambassador , my liege ?
What is it ?
And my king goes on : if your royal father does not sweeten the bitter insult you sent my king and grant all our demands , Henry's artillery will give you so resounding an answer that the very caves and vaulted cathedrals of France shall echo your mocking of him back in your face .
And that's how my brother robbed me of my life , my crown , and my queen all at once .
piece of cheese will get him. , I challenge you to a match .
No , don't pause , because I
At five o'clock he's going to pay me for it .
Whore , your lover's dead now , and you'll be going to hell soon .
I've lost my name and title to a traitor .
Madam , we have to go : the Prince , the Count , Signior Benedick , Don John , and all the gentlemen of the town have come to bring you to church .
Here in the tent .
Damn it , show me what you're going to do for her .
Better late than never , and it's never too late to change .
Take in the wheeled canons with their deadly gaping mouths trained on the walled city of Harfleur .
All hail , Macbeth !
Go ask .
If I ever see it , I will challenge you .
My lord of Orleans , and my lord high Constable , are you talking about horses and armor ?
The only reason you left India was to come here and see that butch Amazon Hippolyta .
Halt !
I love him dearly , and I shall continue to favor him .
Those are the things we pine for now .
If your gentle souls are still flying in the air and have not yet landed where they will remain forever , hover around me with your airy wings and hear your mother's lament .
He sleeps all day like a cat .
Actually , I'm still feeling some pangs of conscience .
Now , tailor , let's see what you've got .
Now what ?
If I had known this young man was his son , I would have tried harder to convince him not to fight .
Tell me .
Before she began shedding tears all over her lovely face , she was the fairest creature in the world , and even now she has no equal .
He who survives this day and lives to see old age shall yearly entertain his neighbors on the eve , saying , "Tomorrow is
Oh wise judge !
If we'd been able to put on our play , we would have had it made .
A tailor made you .
Yes , he did .
How long have you believed in astrology ?
Come with me , sir .
Your husband knew about everything .
I am ready for you .
He was more faithful to me than the sun is to the daytime .
Though I am not a flattering , righteous man , at least you can say that I am honest about being a villain .
The best thing to do is crawl under his cloak .
Varrus and Claudio !
Antony .
She would have died later anyway .
A woman owes her husband the same loyalty a subject owes his king .
I don't like it .
But for your private satisfaction , because I love you , I'll tell you .
Did Diana ever beautify a grove as much as Kate beautifies this room with her queenly movements ?
It's a letter from my brother that I haven't finished reading yet .
That's you , right ?
I'll tell the Queen the reason for our quick departure and get her permission to leave .
No , great king .
Your Honor's is unhealthy talk .
Good night , you amazing woman , you .
Well , how nice , a riddle !
Or maybe there's a chance he didn't drown. , What do you think , sailors ?
No , he's in a place worse than hell .
Was it long or round ?
Where is the fool I sent on ahead ?
You're absolutely right .
I'll go now to find out the date of the wedding .
No , a whole share for me .
You'd better get me But does he know that I'm here in the forest and dressed in men's clothing ?
Be quiet !
Listen Tranio !
What's this , my lord ?
Are you his friend ?
That was my turquoise ring !
Thank you , sir .
Enough !
Fulvia is dead .
I owe you a lot , and like a spoiled kid I've lost what I owe you .
You'd better shut up !
I can justify that better than you can justify sleeping with Portia's African servant .
Let's not , Brutus .
If I were you with eyes and a tongue to speak with , I'd crack heaven wide open with my laments !
Say something , man !
Not true .
It sets you up for a fall .
Brown , madam , and she wouldn't want her forehead to be any lower .
And what if they won't go ?
Worthy sir , greetings !
What a sad sight !
Bardolph , be happy. , Nym , rouse your bragging spirits. , Boy , be brave .
Don't snap at me .
I never thought any less of him .
Caesar , I'm telling you that Antony is dead .
What's wrong ?
Be gone !
Oh , wouldn't it be great if property , rank , official positions , and other honors were earned only by merit , not by corruption ?
Look , it's waving me over again .
If you had foul words in your mouth , then your breath must be foul , and foul breath is nauseating .
That is a certain truth .
Yes , if Messala recommends me to you .
I wrote a verse to this tune , though it's not very imaginative .
Oh , I'm such a coward for living long enough to see my best friend taken before my eyes !
If I had three ears I'd listen with all three .
But
How did you know what happened to your poor father ?
I'm putting myself in God's hands , and with his help I plan to fight against the secret plot that caused this treasonous murder .
I'll help you .
Eyes , look out for the last time !
Keep your word .
I think he got his jacket in Italy , his tights in France , his hat in Germany , and his behavior everywhere .
Is the Prince's punishment any less awful than doomsday ?
And she is very smart .
I did it myself .
I have come here to bury Caesar , not to praise him .
Shame on you , Demetrius !
We're on a tight schedule .
She's dead , I think. , Help , uncle ! , Hero , why Hero !
I think I did , sir .
I don't know you .
Fine .
If our father were dead you'd receive half of his revenue forever , and you'd have my undying love , Edgar." Hmm , what's this , a conspiracy ?
We're at your service , my lord .
Tell me what you did with the king's ship , the sailors , and the other ships .
He's asking him to tell the story again .
And to you , most noble Caesar .
What good luck !
A friend .
Before your sentence has been completed ?
As you were on land .
Go with me to the tomb .
When he leaves , it's very important that I talk to you .
Even in hell you couldn't find a devil worse than Macbeth .
What's all the noise in here ?
Did we , my lord ?
What news do you bring ?
Isn't it a pain that I can't choose or refuse anyone , Nerissa ?
Ah , I'm an odd kind of guy .
He claimed to know that already too , and said that's the reason he's come to speak with you .
Good night .
Then both , or one , or anything you like .
Oh , she's a fine woman !
Yes , you did .
I don't believe it .
He cut my head and gave Sir Toby a bloody head , too .
Sir , the king , Yes , what about him ?
I could rhyme like that for eight years in a row , excepting meal times and sleeping hours .
Since you're old and respected , you should be wise .
Why do you keep repeating that , woman ?
Gentle Octavia , support the one that supports you .
She seemed to be trying to control her emotions , which were overwhelming her .
Is this true ?
Your face betrays strange feelings , my lord , and people will be able to read it like a book .
Let me tell you , the man who marries her will become very wealthy .
Oh , shut up !
Here he is , here he is .
May the gods bless you .
And I love Hastings with all my heart .
He's a very dishonest , puny boy , and more cowardly than a rabbit .
If I could beg others to change their minds , begging would convince me , too .
Some villain has told lies about me .
Let's follow him , Gertrude .
Tell me , Friar , in what part of my body is my name embedded ?
I hear you say "proud" and "I thank you , " and then "no thank you" and "not proud , " you spoiled little girl .
I've done everything you accuse me of , and more , much more .
Ever since these deadly conflicts erupted between your violent countrymen and ours , both you Syracusians and we Ephesians have held serious councils and decided not to permit any travel between our two hostile towns .
What do you say to that , Malvolio ?
Good Lord , what a clown you are !
I represent her .
I forgot about the reward .
Welcome to Rome .
Are you that impatient ?
Has he asked for me ?
And I'm such a sensitive ass that if my hair even tickles me a little , I need to scratch .
But if we have reasons that are strong enough to ignite cowards into action and to make weak women brave , and I think we do , then , countrymen , what else could we possibly need to spur us to action ?
Farewell , good Strato .
Nothing is what it is .
That's an odd thing to say .
Lady , did you sleep in her room last night ?
What does Caesar want ?
We only drink toasts to my niece .
Mine too , to join hers .
What , are we having a feast ?
What's going on , Borachio ?
Master , knock hard upon the door .
It's still waving to me .
Hopefully , your wedding day is only postponed .
Let me see his face .
I swear on my life and honor , he'll sit here in the stocks until noon .
There isn't much time .
What , are you dead , my dove ?
Never a moment of peace !
Well , let it strike ten then .
If you're going to die , be quick about it so you can catch the king's departing soul or follow him , like obedient subjects , to his new kingdom of endless night .
Believe me , I'm not .
So goodbye , my lady .
My dear Regan , your sister's not worth anything .
Don't trust Trebonius .
I should think that your appetite would act like a clock ( as mine does ) and bring you home on its own , without the need for a messenger .
It's true .
The fool's a good actor .
By God , I'm going to tell the duke how slack you've been .
If you're Launcelot , then you're my own flesh and blood .
You got me , I admit it .
I didn't hear anything .
What's this ?
Oh , cut my bodice-staps so that my pent-up heart can have some room to breathe , or I'll faint from this deadly news !
We took this pickax and this shovel from him , as he was walking from this side of the graveyard .
Is he really married ?
I've separated them into groups around the island , just as you ordered .
I'll try to make myself worth your knowledge .
If we do , it'll drive us crazy .
Take these keys and get more spices , Nurse .
Oh , what a villain I am !
The man that once sold the skin of a lion while the beast still lived died hunting him .
Yes , my lord , and calfskin too .
Be silent and go in .
Welcome back from Mantua .
If she glares , I'll say her brow is as clear as roses newly washed with morning dew .
I didn't hear it .
I'm the king himself .
To work as a servant .
I'm off to Venice to buy outfits for the wedding .
Of course .
I tell you , man , it's better for me , too , than the last time we met here .
Why , no , sir .
Now that I think about it , Maria was the one who first told me you were insane .
Be patient , sir !
Now , lords , don't let slip any opportunity that might be advantageous for our expedition .
Bottom , you're Pyramus. , And Flute , you're Thisbe .
Hang on , sir !
And I've never met any men besides you and my father .
So let's join forces and get revenge .
Get on your way and hire those horses .
Say something .
It's weird .
Don't tell me that you've heard about this marriage , Friar , unless you can tell me how to prevent it .
Good night then , Casca .
I'm sure I'll feel guilty if I run away from this Jew , my master .
I'll prove with my sword that I'm not scared of you .
Don't joke about this , Enobarbus .
You say he's friendly with Caesar , healthy , and free .
Why do you say that ?
Are you ?
The Get out of here !
Come , is the bride ready to go to church ?
My lord , you're wrong to berate her like that .
I gave my lover a ring and made him swear never to lose it or give it away .
Destructive thoughts come quickly to the minds of desperate men !
What you say is true .
If I told them about this back in Naples , would they believe me ?
We have consented to all reasonable terms .
I am arrogant , vengeful , ambitious , with more ill will in me than I can fit into my thoughts , and more than I have time to carry it out in .
Oh , that bird from hell !
break out , civil war erupts , kings are betrayed , and the bond between father and son snaps .
You devil , you've put a spell on her !
Her only flaw , and it's a big one , is that she's unbearable , a total witch , so much so that I wouldn't think of marrying her myself , not even if I were in a worse fix than I am , not for a whole goldmine .
Be patient , because the prize I'm leading you to will make you forget how smelly you are now .
If I let myself do what I yearn to , I'd rip the flesh off your bones .
That's better than exaggerating our trust .
Why not ?
Listen !
No , the whole day , and all night too .
Why are you talking like this ?
Indeed , they say my uncle grew so fast that he could gnaw on a crust of bread when he was two hours old .
For God's sake , my lord , let's be sure to be part of the group that meets the prince .
He left to fetch a necklace and he promised to bring it to the Porcupine , where I was dining with Balthasar .
I would rather listen to my dog bark at a crow than hear a man swear that he loves me .
I'll tell him right away , my lord .
Whether you're a good spirit or a cursed demon , whether you bring heavenly breezes or blasts of hell fire , whether your intentions are good or evil , you look so strange I want to talk to you .
It's been this way ever since the first government was organized .
That's what Fulvia told me .
I'd rather get a husband from your father .
This just may cheer me up .
What are you thinking about so seriously ?
Oh , Pomfret , Pomfret !
Go release them , Ariel .
I hear my father coming .
They swore that you were nearly dead with love for me .
No more than my staying here in Rome might mean to you in Egypt .
She takes these signs for warnings and predictions of terrible evils to come , and , on her knee , she begged me to stay home today .
What would the King of Naples do if he heard you say that ?
Who's this ?
If you see me without it , you can be confident I'm dead .
Listen up , you slave .
Why have your rosy cheeks faded so quickly ?
Francis Flute , the bellows-repairman ?
My brother is in heaven .
Three times in an hour I saw him down , and three times up again and fighting .
That's it , I'm done .
If you have me , you have me now at my worst ; and if you have me , you'll appreciate me better and better .
Go find out the news .
Whatever happens to me , this is a soldier's kiss .
As for those who have , I beg you to excuse the gaps in time , and the many people and things that can not be represented here in all their magnitude and proper form .
And you're all sizzle .
A beautiful voice , I swear .
Well , I recognize this one Good God !
Thanks , you brave men who defend this island and respect Othello .
It's my birthday .
Wait , here's a penny to heal your head .
Goodbye , cousin .
You know that Banquo and his son Fleance are still alive .
Tell me .
Well , I disagree .
If you continue treating Hermia so badly , you'll pay for it .
Hero , the daughter and heir of Leonato .
So the lion disappeared .
Go , then , mother , to your daughter .
Give me your first , Mr. Mustardseed .
Madam !
Who could have restrained himself , who loved Duncan and had the courage to act on it ?
Some of them give me money , some invite me places , some thank me for the kind things I've done for them , some try to sell me things .
Here's why : it'd be better for the enemy to come after us .
Tomorrow , my lord .
Can I have a word with you ?
Do you know what Caesar intends to do with me ?
Yes , from top to bottom , sir .
You know where I live .
Don't harp on that point , madam , it's past .
