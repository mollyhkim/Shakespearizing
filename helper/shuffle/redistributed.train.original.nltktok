Another Hero !
For I have seen more years , I'm sure , than ye .
In those freckles live their savors .
O sir , fly this place .
Revenge .
Oh , she doth teach the torches to burn bright !
Down from the waist they are centaurs , though women all above .
And then , as we have ta'en the sacrament , We will unite the white rose and the red .
Gracious Olivia , What do you say , Cesario ? , Good my lord , My lord would speak .
Where wilt thou lead me ?
Nor send you out o ' th ' way ?
I do repent The tedious minutes I with her have spent .
The time of universal peace is near .
Ay , and that thou and the proudest of you all shall find when he comes home .
Made she no verbal question ?
And I have built Two chantries where the sad and solemn priests Sing still for Richard's soul .
And must they all be hanged that swear and lie ?
Thou shouldst know There were a heart in Egypt .
You have of late stood out against your brother , and he hath ta'en you newly into his grace , where it is impossible you should take true root but by the fair weather that you make yourself .
Come hither , captain .
Give me your hand , And let me all your fortunes understand .
Away , then !
Farewell , my lord .
Who does me this ?
Assume a virtue if you have it not .
He is my dear friend , an please you .
Then hear me , gracious sovereign , and you peers That owe yourselves , your lives , and services To this imperial throne .
What said Northumberland as touching Richmond ?
What will you do ?
Thrice hath Calphurnia in her sleep cried out , "Help , ho !
You will answer , "The slaves are ours." So do I answer you .
O my lord , my lord , Forgive my fearful sails !
Good sister , wrong me not nor wrong yourself , To make a bondmaid and a slave of me .
Forbear me .
O , cleave , my sides !
There's another garment for 't .
Madam , madam , Antonio's dead !
Desire him to go in .
Therefore You will not pay for the glasses you have burst ?
My resolution and my hands I'll trust , None about Caesar .
Why so , being gone , Why so , being gone , I am a man again .
Is there no offense in 't ?
Oh , a cherubim Thou wast that did preserve me .
On thy love , I charge thee .
Fie , fie !
It is a hint That wrings mine eyes to 't .
Thanks for that .
A laughter .
We'll overreach the graybeard , Gremio , The narrow-prying father , Minola , The quaint musician , amorous Litio , All for my master's sake , Lucentio .
As from a bear a man would run for life , So fly I from her that would be my wife .
It is both he and she : Your son and daughter .
And may you prove , sir , master of your art .
Sit , Jessica .
By computation and mine host's report , I could not speak with Dromio since at first I sent him from the mart .
These growing feathers plucked from Caesar's wing Will make him fly an ordinary pitch , Who else would soar above the view of men And keep us all in servile fearfulness .
Fare you well , my lord .
Worthy prince , I know 't .
Good sister , let us dine and never fret .
Oh , wonder !
Here is the number of the slaughtered French .
Then must thou needs find out new heaven , new earth .
It seems to me That yet we sleep , we dream .
Make haste , make haste , sirrah .
Besides , I like you not .
I think he be angry indeed .
Ay , that Petruchio came .
And therefore , like herself , wise , fair and true , Shall she be placed in my constant soul .
Here comes Ancient Pistol and his wife .
And friends with Caesar .
What are they , beseech your ladyship ?
Dear Kate , you and I can not be confined within the weak list of a country's fashion .
Who alone suffers , suffers most i ' th ' mind , Leaving free things and happy shows behind .
No ?
And their tongues rot That speak against us !
Why , then Othello and Desdemona return again to Venice .
Lay thy finger thus , and let thy soul be instructed .
Justice , find the girl !
Antonio never yet was thief or pirate , Though , I confess , on base and ground enough , Orsino's enemy .
If all the wine in my bottle will recover him , I will help his ague .
He will bear you easily and reins well .
And lovers ' absent hours More tedious than the dial eightscore times !
Our enemies have beat us to the pit .
Which is Sebastian ?
Saints do not move , though grant for prayers ' sake .
Then yield thee , coward , And live to be the show and gaze o ' th ' time .
Come , my lord , and in our flight Tell me how it came this night That I sleeping here was found With these mortals on the ground .
If he filled His vacancy with his voluptuousness , Full surfeits and the dryness of his bones Call on him for 't .
Confusion's cure lives not In these confusions .
My tables ! , Meet it is I set it down That one may smile , and smile , and be a villain .
I will ask him for my place again , he shall tell me I am a drunkard .
And this way have you well expounded it .
Be not offended .
Then you live about her waist , or in the middle of her favors ?
It hath the primal eldest curse upon 't , A brother's murder .
Tis done .
Dost thou hear , lady ?
Five hundred poor I have in yearly pay , Who twice a day their withered hands hold up Toward heaven to pardon blood .
Ay , better than him I am before knows me .
Shall we go send them dinners and fresh suits , And give their fasting horses provender , And after fight with them ?
Return with her ?
Neither , my lord .
None but friends .
I was hurt under your arm .
I'll have them sleep on cushions in my tent .
What do you see ?
In spite of your heart , I think .
What say you to a piece of beef and mustard ?
Help , ho !
Can you tell me whether one Launcelot that dwells with him , dwell with him or no ?
I must needs report the truth .
I have well approved it , sir .
What prisoners of good sort are taken , uncle ?
This 'greed upon To part with unhacked edges and bear back Our targes undinted .
Why , as I told thee , 'tis a custom with him , I ' th ' afternoon to sleep .
He can not prevail with me .
Do it at once , Or thy precedent services are all But accidents unpurposed .
That shall be by and by .
I have no hope That he's undrowned .
The noble Brutus Hath told you Caesar was ambitious .
Ay , if your self's remembrance wrong yourself .
Ay , but when ?
How ?
No , thou proud dream , That play'st so subtly with a king's repose .
Tis a very excellent piece of work , madam lady .
Leave me , Iago .
Not know my voice !
There rust and let me die .
In happy time .
What , are we cuckolds ere we have deserved it ?
If you'll patch a quarrel , As matter whole you have to make it with , It must not be with this .
I think he will carry this island home in his pocket and give it his son for an apple .
Twas the boy that stole your meat , and you'll beat the post .
About a hoop of gold , a paltry ring That she did give me , whose posy was For all the world like cutler's poetry Upon a knife , "Love me and leave me not." What talk you of the posy or the value ?
She did commend my yellow stockings of late , she did praise my leg being cross-gartered , and in this she manifests herself to my love , and with a kind of injunction , drives me to these habits of her liking .
I will compound this strife .
I embrace it .
Follow the noise so far as we have quarter ; Let's see how it will give off .
If thou and nature can so gently part , The stroke of death is as a lover's pinch , Which hurts , and is desired .
But , Roderigo , if thou hast that in thee indeed , which I have greater reason to believe now than ever , I mean purpose , courage and valor , this night show it .
Hazard for lead ?
It is heresy .
Heart , once be stronger than thy continent .
It is the more like to be feigned .
Who would fardels bear , To grunt and sweat under a weary life , But that the dread of something after death , The undiscovered country from whose bourn No traveler returns , puzzles the will And makes us rather bear those ills we have Than fly to others that we know not of ?
Our arms in strength of malice and our hearts Of brothers ' temper do receive you in With all kind love , good thoughts , and reverence .
Take their examination yourself and bring it me .
And we'll consign thereto. , Will you , fair sister , Go with the princes or stay here with us ?
This is the man .
I fear me you'll be in till then .
A good matter , surely .
And wished to see thee cross-gartered." Cross-gartered ?
A golden mind stoops not to shows of dross .
We are bound to the like .
Oh , that I were a man !
No .
Her eye in heaven Would through the airy region stream so bright That birds would sing and think it were not night .
Whither should they come ?
Caesar !
You durst not so have tempted him .
Sit down and rest .
It is a reeling world indeed , my lord , And I believe will never stand upright Till Richard wear the garland of the realm .
Besides , in mercy , The constable desires thee thou wilt mind Thy followers of repentance , that their souls May make a peaceful and a sweet retire From off these fields where , wretches , their poor bodies Must lie and fester .
Let wantons light of heart Tickle the senseless rushes with their heels .
Which is that adversary ?
If thou follow him , thou must needs wear my coxcomb. , How now , nuncle ?
Not ?
Now art thou sociable .
So were their daggers , which unwiped we found Upon their pillows .
If ever he have wife , let her be made More miserable by the death of him Than I am made by my poor lord and thee. , Come now towards Chertsey with your holy load , Taken from Paul's to be interred there .
Widow Dido" said you ?
God witness with me , I have wept for thine .
Are you our daughter ?
Silence that dreadful bell , it frights the isle From her propriety .
Heaven rest them now .
Why , that was he .
Lady , shall I lie in your lap ?
Tis hard ; almost impossible .
Yea , or to paint himself ?
Not very well , but I have met him oft , And he hath bought the cottage and the bounds That the old carlot once was master of .
At night we'll feast together .
The sight is dismal , And our affairs from England come too late .
Be simple-answered , for we know the truth .
With all my heart .
Dispatch. , O love , That thou couldst see my wars today , and knew'st The royal occupation !
This , Decius Brutus .
For thy escape would teach me tyranny , To hang clogs on them. , I have done , my lord .
We are no tyrant , but a Christian king , Unto whose grace our passion is as subject As is our wretches fettered in our prisons .
Well , as you guess ?
The great rage , You see , is killed in him .
Fathers , from hence trust not your daughters ' minds By what you see them act .
My maid Nerissa and myself meantime Will live as maids and widows .
We shall , my lord .
If you would know your wronger , look on me .
Ere the bat hath flown His cloistered flight , ere to black Hecate's summons The shard-borne beetle with his drowsy hums Hath rung night's yawning peal , there shall be done A deed of dreadful note .
Why , that were covetousness .
I will incontinently drown myself .
Nay , I am the very pink of courtesy .
Dead , dead ?
Upon his royal face there is no note How dread an army hath enrounded him , Nor doth he dedicate one jot of color Unto the weary and all-watched night , But freshly looks and overbears attaint With cheerful semblance and sweet majesty , That every wretch , pining and pale before , Beholding him , plucks comfort from his looks .
Nay , good goose , bite not .
But for your husband , He is noble , wise , judicious , and best knows The fits o ' th ' season .
I am content , so the maiden cities you talk of may wait on her .
You must call forth the watch that are their accusers .
Behind the arras I'll convey myself To hear the process .
Go , keep us company , And we shall make full satisfaction. , Thirty-three years have I but gone in travail Of you , my sons , and till this present hour My heavy burden ne'er delivered. , The Duke , my husband , and my children both , And you , the calendars of their nativity , Go to a gossips ' feast , and go with me .
Oh , then I see that madmen have no ears .
For I am sure , Though you can guess what temperance should be , You know not what it is .
Be not lost So poorly in your thoughts .
Ere he do leave this grove , Thou shalt fly him and he shall seek thy love .
Go , make money .
I pray you , turn the key and keep our counsel .
Enough to purchase what you have made known .
My lord ?
He would not take the crown .
Added to these , Of knights , esquires , and gallant gentlemen , Eight thousand and four hundred , of the which , Five hundred were but yesterday dubbed knights .
You do assist the storm .
You may be pleased to catch at mine intent By what did here befall me .
Something , sure , of state , Either from Venice , or some unhatched practice Made demonstrable here in Cyprus to him , Hath puddled his clear spirit , and in such cases Men's natures wrangle with inferior things , Though great ones are their object .
All's cheerless , dark , and deadly .
Madam , I wish it may .
I perceive these lords At this encounter do so much admire That they devour their reason and scarce think Their eyes do offices of truth , their words Are natural breath. , But howsoev'r you have Been justled from your senses , know for certain That I am Prospero and that very duke Which was thrust forth of Milan , who most strangely Upon this shore where you were wracked , was landed , To be the lord on 't .
He's married , madam .
Something from Cyprus as I may divine .
Or , failing so , yet that I put the Moor At least into a jealousy so strong That judgment can not cure .
Words without thoughts never to heaven go .
Here's Cassio hurt by villains .
He knows not what he says , and vain it is That we present us to him .
I pray thee , do not mock me , fellow student .
And if it stand , as you yourself still do , Within the eye of honor , be assured My purse , my person , my extremest means Lie all unlocked to your occasions .
Where is he now ?
If the Prince be too important , tell him there is measure in everything , and so dance out the answer .
Sir , in Argier .
Comes there any more of it ?
Yea , Richard , when I know , for I protest As yet I do not .
Th ' abuse of greatness is when it disjoins Remorse from power .
Now , sweet lord , You know the goodness I intend upon you .
Much good do you , scald knave , heartily .
Thou didst drink The stale of horses and the gilded puddle Which beasts would cough at .
Now he denies it faintly , and laughs it out .
But who comes here ?
Say either , and I'll stay the circumstance .
You do mistake your business .
Good morrow , brother Bedford .
Pronounce this sentence then : Women may fall when there's no strength in men .
Let me alone .
Who is here so vile that will not love his country ?
The more my wrong , the more his spite appears .
It is here , Hamlet .
There sleeps Titania sometime of the night , Lulled in these flowers with dances and delight .
Look where she comes .
And here will rest me .
We are resolved , my lord .
If I could win a lady at leapfrog or by vaulting into my saddle with my armor on my back , under the correction of bragging be it spoken , I should quickly leap into a wife .
So in the world .
I had as lief have a reed that will do me no service as a partisan I could not heave .
What is your parentage ? " "Above my fortunes , yet my state is well .
I'll able 'em .
Is it not Hero ?
Whiles I threat , he lives .
Till then sit still , my soul .
The meantime , lady , I'll raise the preparation of a war Shall stain your brother .
It is too hard a knot for me to untie !
Do so .
And did they bid you tell her of it , madam ?
We would not die in that man's company That fears his fellowship to die with us .
By my head , here comes the Capulets .
Here's packing , with a witness , to deceive us all !
If you pardon , we will mend .
Can he that deny ?
Whither are you going ?
Come , come and take a queen Worth many babes and beggars !
But , come what may , I do adore thee so That danger shall seem sport , and I will go .
I hope the king made peace with all of us ; And the compact is firm and true in me .
A spirit I am indeed , But am in that dimension grossly clad Which from the womb I did participate .
I would thou hadst told me of another father .
Inquire me out some mean poor gentleman , Whom I will marry straight to Clarence ' daughter .
Do not yourself such wrong , who are in this Relieved but not betrayed .
Yea , but you must not make the full show of this till you may do it without controlment .
We will yet do well .
Very well took , i ' faith , wisely , wisely .
He , when he hears of her , can not refrain From the excess of laughter .
We are spoiled and yonder he is !
You were best to tell Antonio what you hear , Yet do not suddenly , for it may grieve him .
Shalt see thy other daughter will use thee kindly .
Where is Montjoy the herald ?
Goes Fleance with you ?
I had most need of blessing , and "Amen" Stuck in my throat .
They bleed on both sides. , How is it , my lord ?
Hast thou no letters to me from the friar ?
Your children were vexation to your youth , But mine shall be a comfort to your age .
Have mercy , Jesu ! , Soft , I did but dream .
How say you now ?
Ha , what sayest thou ?
Thou hast a sister by the mother's side , Admired Octavia .
Oh , dispatch me !
He is now in some commerce with my lady and will by and by depart .
I'll drain him dry as hay .
Prithee , no more .
Yes , madam , he was of that consort .
That lord that counseled thee To give away thy land , Come place him here by me .
Pooh , you speak like a green girl , Unsifted in such perilous circumstance .
For Edward , for my brother , for his sake .
To express the like kindness , myself , that have been more kindly beholding to you than any , freely give unto you this young scholar
No , none by me .
Alas , poor country !
A good and virtuous nature may recoil In an imperial charge .
Caliban !
O , if I thought that , I'd beat him like a dog !
I can not tell .
Go , sirrah , trudge about Through fair Verona .
Why , what else ?
My reputation , Iago , my reputation !
Jailer , look to him .
Look , here she comes .
Go you and tell her of it .
Brutus , bait not me .
For when she saw , Which never shall be found , you did suspect She had disposed with Caesar , and that your rage Would not be purged , she sent you word she was dead .
To plainness honor's bound When majesty falls to folly .
Oh , she knew well Thy love did read by rote , that could not spell .
I must obey .
For my dinner .
A peevish schoolboy , worthless of such honor , Joined with a masker and a reveler !
Moon and stars !
I was forbid it .
Thou art a traitor , Off with his head .
Yon light is not daylight , I know it , I .
Oh , but she'll keep her word .
But when they should endure the bloody spur , They fall their crests and , like deceitful jades , Sink in the trial .
Do you hear , masters ?
Moody ?
So , This is to horse .
I pray you stand good father to me now .
Help me hence , ho !
lie on her ?
This you should pity rather than despise .
Into what dangers would you lead me , Cassius , That you would have me seek into myself For that which is not in me ?
His grace speaks cheerfully .
Upon his brow shame is ashamed to sit , For 'tis a throne where honor may be crowned .
But how did you desire it should be made ?
You nimble lightnings , dart your blinding flames Into her scornful eyes !
Wert thou not my brother , I would not take this hand from thy throat till this other had pulled out thy tongue for saying so .
This savors not much of distraction .
Look , love , what envious streaks Do lace the severing clouds in yonder east .
He'll never yield to that .
Let the garden door be shut , and leave me to my hearing .
If by your art , my dearest father , you have Put the wild waters in this roar , allay them .
What was th ' impediment that broke this off ?
I will proclaim my name about the field .
I have known when there was no music with him but the drum and the fife , and now had he rather hear the tabor and the pipe .
Calls your Worship ?
For Pyramus therein doth kill himself .
She was a vixen when she went to school .
Nay , I hope .
I can say little more than I have studied , and that question's out of my part .
Shylock , do you hear ?
I am a soldier , I , Older in practice , abler than yourself To make conditions .
We speak no treason , man .
You sent me for a rope's end as soon .
Not I , my lord .
There is no fear in him .
But yet , I say , If imputation and strong circumstances Which lead directly to the door of truth Will give you satisfaction , you may have 't .
Didst thou see any thing ?
Would I had met my dearest foe in heaven Or ever I had seen that day , Horatio .
What I can do I will , and more I will Than for myself I dare .
An if I be , sir , is it any offense ?
Dissolve , thick cloud , and rain , that I may say The gods themselves do weep !
The king shall drink to Hamlet's better breath , And in the cup an union shall he throw Richer than that which four successive kings In Denmark's crown have worn .
He hath given his empire Up to a whore ; who now are levying The kings o' th' earth for war .
One Hero died defiled , but I do live , And surely as I live , I am a maid .
I remember The first time ever Caesar put it on .
This is the very painting of your fear .
Enjoy the honey-heavy dew of slumber .
I'll meet you at that place some hour hence .
Say , "the brave Antony." The valiant Caesar !
This is an aspic's trail , and these fig leaves Have slime upon them , such as th' aspic leaves Upon the caves of Nile .
You will never run mad , niece .
How now , Roderigo !
Would I might But ever see that man !
Amen .
So could I too .
From this time Such I account thy love .
Are there no stones in heaven But what serve for the thunder ? , Precious villain !
There is one goat for you .
Why , your lieutenant , Cassio .
Why , headstrong liberty is lashed with woe .
I have it ready for thee .
Do you go back dismayed ?
Nor I , my lord , in faith .
Go you with me and I will use your skill. , Good cousin , have a care this busy time .
News , my good lord , from Rome .
He threw his eye aside , And mark what object did present itself : Under an old oak , whose boughs were mossed with age And high top bald with dry antiquity , A wretched , ragged man , o'ergrown with hair , Lay sleeping on his back .
Sayest thou so ?
It hath not appeared .
Sure , I shall never marry like my sisters , To love my father all .
Here will I rest me till the break of day .
I am content , so thou wilt have it so .
Look , where she comes .
Then , if they die unprovided , no more is the king guilty of their damnation than he was before guilty of those impieties for the which they are now visited .
Alack , sir , he is mad .
Aha !
A fair woman !
Observe how Antony becomes his flaw , And what thou think'st his very action speaks In every power that moves .
Miranda. , O my father , I have broke your hest to say so !
I never saw a better-fashioned gown , More quaint , more pleasing , nor more commendable .
She will indite him to some supper .
Marry , that should you if I were your mistress , or I should think my honesty ranker than my wit .
Petruchio , stand by a while .
I bring thee tidings of the Prince's doom .
Let us not break with him , For he will never follow anything That other men begin .
Do not run away .
Thy love ne'er alter till thy sweet life end !
And the hour , I think , is come To give him hearing .
But yet , madam , I do not like "But yet." It does allay The good precedence .
Die for adultery ?
Am I a married man or a bachelor ?
Ere I would say I would drown myself for the love of a guinea hen , I would change my humanity with a baboon .
When holy and devout religious men Are at their beads , 'tis much to draw them thence , So sweet is zealous contemplation .
What means that bloody knife ?
What's the matter with thee now ?
Thou hast killed my child .
By heaven , it is as proper to our age To cast beyond ourselves in our opinions As it is common for the younger sort To lack discretion .
By my troth , niece , thou wilt never get thee a husband if thou be so shrewd of thy tongue .
I did nothing .
Tis a world to see , How tame , when men and women are alone , A meacock wretch can make the curstest shrew. , Give me thy hand , Kate .
His fault concludes but what the law should end , The life of Tybalt .
Banquo and Macbeth , all hail !
Puppet" ?
Gives him three thousand crowns in annual fee And his commission to employ those soldiers , So levied as before , against the Polack , With an entreaty , herein further shown , That it might please you to give quiet pass Through your dominions for this enterprise , On such regards of safety and allowance As therein are set down .
Who's within ?
How now , friend Eros !
Nobody .
Only I here importune death awhile , until Of many thousand kisses the poor last I lay upon thy lips .
O mighty Caesar !
I am not of your element .
Come .
Vouchsafe to wear this ring .
I am amazed and know not what to say .
Fellow , I know thee .
And all my armor laid into my tent ?
Kneel not , gentle Portia .
These late eclipses in the sun and moon portend no good to us .
Now , my friendly knave , I thank thee .
Sir , he dined with her there , at the Porpentine .
Yet I have not seen So likely an ambassador of love .
Marian , I say !
If thou canst love me for this , take me .
Abhorred slave , Which any print of goodness wilt not take , Being capable of all ill !
If she live long , And in the end meet the old course of death , Women will all turn monsters .
Thou art sure of me .
And , gentle friends , Let's kill him boldly but not wrathfully .
Who knows not where a wasp does wear his sting ?
I came hither to tell you ; and , circumstances shortened , for she has been too long a-talking of , the lady is disloyal .
What's he that speaks for Edmund , Earl of Gloucester ?
Come , sir , I pray you , go .
Therefore play , music. , Prince , thou art sad .
The more I hate , the more he follows me .
Or if thou hast not broke from company Abruptly , as my passion now makes me , Thou hast not loved .
Let me speak a little .
A fox when one has caught her And such a daughter Should sure to the slaughter , If my cap would buy a halter .
What ho , the Emperor's guard !
The king is not to answer it .
Strike not by land ; keep whole .
If more , the more thou'st wronged me .
They would have me as familiar with men's pockets as their gloves or their handkerchers , which makes much against my manhood , if I should take from another's pocket to put into mine , for it is plain pocketing up of wrongs .
My sight was ever thick .
Be not too late .
Unto bad causes swear Such creatures as men doubt .
And this may help to thicken other proofs That do demonstrate thinly .
Most mighty sovereign , You have no cause to hold my friendship doubtful .
Had I great Juno's power , The strong-winged Mercury should fetch thee up And set thee by Jove's side .
Bid them come near .
Gentle lady , When I did first impart my love to you , I freely told you , all the wealth I had Ran in my veins .
You have trained me like a peasant , obscuring and hiding from me all gentlemanlike qualities .
And you , sir .
Alas , good gentleman !
We therefore have great cause of thankfulness And shall forget the office of our hand Sooner than quittance of desert and merit According to the weight and worthiness .
Why ?
Didst thou not say he lied ?
Where are the vile beginners of this fray ?
No offense i ' th ' world .
I'll call upon you straight .
Talkest thou nothing but of ladies ?
I will be gone , sir , and not trouble you .
Ratcliffe , come hither .
I may command where I adore , But silence , like a Lucrece knife , With bloodless stroke my heart doth gore ; M.O.A.I .
Andrew Aguecheek"
Antonio , I am married to a wife Which is as dear to me as life itself .
Tis almost morning .
Y ' have ungently , Brutus , Stole from my bed .
But then I saw no harm , and then I heard Each syllable that breath made up between them .
It is impossible they bear it out .
They could be content To visit other places , and come down With fearful bravery , thinking by this face To fasten in our thoughts that they have courage .
Yearly will I do this rite .
And is he a man to encounter Tybalt ?
The competitors enter .
By and by .
O , remember , God , To hear her prayer for them , as now for us !
Be brisk 0awhile , and the longer liver take all .
That's my sister .
You have said , but whether wisely or no , let the forest judge .
Do you find Your patience so predominant in your nature That you can let this go ?
Gentlemen , can any of you tell me where I may find the young Romeo ?
I'll carry it to the pile .
Almost at odds with morning , which is which .
My wife killed too ?
Thieves !
Yet have I left a daughter .
What , so brief ?
Answer me in one word .
I delight in masques and revels sometimes altogether .
My lord , that would dishonor him !
Sooth , but you must .
I urged you further , then you scratched your head And too impatiently stamped with your foot .
I know not what you mean by that , but I am sure Caesar fell down .
Why , so I did .
O Bottom , thou art changed !
Did you ?
That which ordinary men are fit for , I am qualified in .
Didst thou hear these verses ?
And , but for ceremony , such a wretch , Winding up days with toil and nights with sleep , Had the forehand and vantage of a king .
Get you to church , and have a good priest that can tell you what marriage is .
You must sing This nothing's more than matter .
Hath she forsook so many noble matches , Her father and her country , and her friends , To be called "whore" ?
I am stuffed , cousin .
Is my lord well , that he doth speak so wide ?
Most certain .
A most ridiculous monster , to make a wonder of a poor drunkard .
Swords out , and tilting one at other's breasts In opposition bloody .
Conduct me to mine host .
That is my rest ; that is the rendezvous of it .
Hie you to church .
O , thou well-skilled in curses , stay awhile , And teach me how to curse mine enemies .
When valor preys on reason , It eats the sword it fights with .
Hark , now I hear them .
You'll win two days upon me .
He only in a general honest thought And common good to all , made one of them .
Let me speak proudly : tell the constable We are but warriors for the working day ; Our gayness and our gilt are all besmirched With rainy marching in the painful field .
First , if all obstacles were cut away And that my path were even to the crown As the ripe revenue and due of birth , Yet so much is my poverty of spirit , So mighty and so many my defects , That I would rather hide me from my greatness , Being a bark to brook no mighty sea , Than in my greatness covet to be hid And in the vapor of my glory smothered .
O , then it moved her ?
All is the fear and nothing is the love , As little is the wisdom , where the flight So runs against all reason .
A lioness hath whelped in the streets , And graves have yawned and yielded up their dead .
Is it possible dat I sould love de enemy of France ?
Now would I give a thousand furlongs of sea for an acre of barren ground : long heath , brown furze , anything .
But this is trifling , And all the more it seeks to hide itself The bigger bulk it shows .
I saw the Duchess of Milan's gown that they praise so .
Let life be short , else shame will be too long .
What beard were I best to play it in ?
We'll bring him to his house with shouts and clamors .
The lamentable change is from the best ; The worst returns to laughter .
Lo , where it comes again .
I pray you tell me .
What think you on 't ?
Shall we go seek Benedick and tell him of her love ?
This is the excellent foppery of the world that when we are sick in fortune , often the surfeit of our own behavior , we make guilty of our disasters the sun , the moon , and the stars , as if we were villains by necessity , fools by heavenly compulsion , knaves , thieves , and treachers by spherical predominance , drunkards , liars , and adulterers by an enforced obedience of planetary influence , and all that we are evil in by a divine thrusting-on .
My master's .
Where have I been ?
A privilege never to see me more .
What , art thou hurt ?
I'll make so bold to call , For 'tis my limited service .
Alas , what is the matter ?
Now they believe it and withal whet me To be revenged on Rivers , Dorset , Grey ; But then I sigh and , with a piece of scripture , Tell them that God bids us do good for evil ; And thus I clothe my naked villainy With odd old ends stolen out of Holy Writ , And seem a saint when most I play the devil .
Richmond is on the seas .
O gentle lady , 'T is not for you to hear what I can speak : The repetition , in a woman's ear , Would murder as it fell .
His very opinion in the letter !
I know his soul is in heaven , fool .
But yet for all that , an if she did not hate him deadly , she would love him dearly .
Two nights together had these gentlemen , Marcellus and Barnardo , on their watch , In the dead waste and middle of the night , Been thus encountered : a figure like your father , Armed at point exactly , cap-a-pie , Appears before them and with solemn march Goes slow and stately by them .
In cunning I must draw my sword upon you .
Why , then thou canst not break her to the lute ?
But for the seventh cause .
Well , but to my choice .
Shylock is my name .
I have lived long enough .
Affection is not rated from the heart .
The throng that follows Caesar at the heels , Of senators , of praetors , common suitors , Will crowd a feeble man almost to death .
Within this three hours will fair Juliet wake .
We'll hear a play tomorrow .
Hence , be gone , away !
This was sometime a paradox , but now the time gives it proof .
And the best of me is diligence .
They are natural." For I believe they are portentous things Unto the climate that they point upon .
Speak low if you speak love .
Well , then I shall see thee again ?
My liege and madam , to expostulate What majesty should be , what duty is , Why day is day , night night , and time is time , Were nothing but to waste night , day , and time .
Read it .
I pray you now receive them .
And have you mercy too !
The quality of mercy is not strained .
We first address towards you , who with this king Hath rivaled for our daughter .
Let fall thy blade on vulnerable crests ; I bear a charmed life , which must not yield To one of woman born .
Most meet That first we come to words , and therefore have we Our written purposes before us sent , Which , if thou hast considered , let us know If 'twill tie up thy discontented sword And carry back to Sicily much tall youth That else must perish here .
I shall deliver so .
In cash , most justly paid .
What , has his daughters brought him to this pass ? , Couldst thou save nothing ?
May I with right and conscience make this claim ?
I am much bound to you .
Right glad I am he was not at this fray .
I am not bound to please thee with my answers .
You strike my people , and your disordered rabble Make servants of their betters .
What are you ?
Who serv'st thou under ?
Prithee , be not angry .
Nay , but the devil take mocking .
Soldier , why wear'st thou that glove in thy cap ?
He knows I know him well .
And here my mistress .
How , in one house , Should many people under two commands Hold amity ?
Come , you are too severe a moraler .
Ready .
I would know that .
One word more , honest neighbors .
And stand indebted , over and above , In love and service to you evermore .
In truth , I know it is a sin to be a mocker , but he ! , why , he hath a horse better than the Neapolitan's , a better bad habit of frowning than the Count Palatine .
Beshrew his soul for me !
She , dying , gave it me And bid me , when my fate would have me wived , To give it her .
I ' faith , i ' faith , and both in a tune like two gypsies on a horse .
And I will sing it in the latter end of a play before the duke .
Thou worms ' meat in respect of a good piece of flesh , indeed .
What say you ?
We'll mutiny .
My fairy lord , this must be done with haste .
This bud of love , by summer's ripening breath , May prove a beauteous flower when next we meet .
It is backed like a weasel .
Seigneur Martino and his wife and daughters ; County Anselme and his beauteous sisters ; The lady widow of Vitruvio ; Seigneur Placentio and his lovely nieces ; Mercutio and his brother Valentine ; Mine uncle Capulet , his wife and daughters ; My fair niece Rosaline and Livia ;
It gives me wonder great as my content To see you here before me .
Do you hear , Cassio ?
Romeo slew Tybalt .
Pray you , leave your courtesy , good monsieur .
And begged he pardon ?
Am I your bird ?
We'll answer .
Tis midnight .
Within our files there are , Of those that served Mark Antony but late , Enough to fetch him in .
Truly , sir , all that I live by is with the awl .
Thou makest me merry .
What news ?
For me , three thousand ducats .
If you will not murder me for my love , let me be your servant .
The time is come .
Come on , assay .
If they suffer our departure , death's the word .
If it be a suit from the count , I am sick , or not at home .
No man's life was to be trusted with them .
He did me kindness , sir , drew on my side , But in conclusion put strange speech upon me .
The ship was under sail .
Tell me your counsels .
Three of the carriages , in faith , are very dear to fancy , very responsive to the hilts , most delicate carriages , and of very liberal conceit .
It is twice blessed : It blesseth him that gives and him that takes .
Yes , in truth it is , sir .
He is sure possessed , madam .
I have no long spoon .
Will you be married , motley ?
You know my mind .
The business of the state does him offence , And he does chide with you .
After the battle let George Stanley die .
Never did I know A creature that did bear the shape of man So keen and greedy to confound a man .
I pray you , have a continent forbearance till the speed of his rage goes slower .
Yours in the ranks of death .
Never was monarch better feared and loved Than is your Majesty .

This island's mine , by Sycorax my mother , Which thou takest from me .
Nay , I'll ne'er believe a madman till I see his brains .
Wherefore this ghastly looking ?
Some oracle Must rectify our knowledge .
The shrill-gorged lark so far Can not be seen or heard .
Keep me in temper .
My child is yet a stranger in the world .
Marry , heaven forbid !
That you should here repent you , The actors are at hand , and by their show You shall know all that you are like to know .
I have heard it said so .
I wish your Worship well .
That's her torment .
That I did for him .
I have heard of some kind of men that put quarrels purposely on others , to taste their valor .
I'll read the writing .
Do not desire to see this letter .
Alas , poor ghost !
Most high , most mighty , and most puissant Caesar , Metellus Cimber throws before thy seat An humble heart , I must prevent thee , Cimber .
It is a beast for Perseus .
I will bestow a breakfast to make you friends ; and we'll be all three sworn brothers to France .
It is my wretched fortune .
I pray you , look upon her .
He hath been out nine years , and away he shall again .
He calls me "boy" and chides as he had power To beat me out of Egypt .
I am sorry for her , as I have just cause , being her uncle and her guardian .
It is the prince of palfreys .
Fool , do not flatter .
We think not so , my lord .
All the East , Say thou , shall call her mistress." So he nodded , And soberly did mount an arm-gaunt steed , Who neighed so high that what I would have spoke Was beastly dumbed by him .
I am poisoned .
Go to the gate .
Have you delivered to her our decree ?
They told me I was everything .
Tell him there's a post come from my master with his horn full of good news .
Adieu !
This is the truth , or let Benvolio die .
Get thee gone , but do it .
Imperious Caesar , dead and turned to clay , Might stop a hole to keep the wind away .
Twill be naught , But let it be .
His daughter and I will be king and queen , save our graces ! , and Trinculo and thyself shall be viceroys. , Dost thou like the plot , Trinculo ?
Repair thy wit , good youth , or it will fall To cureless ruin .
He'll make a proper man .
Fear comes upon me .
Searching the window for a flint , I found This paper , thus sealed up , and I am sure It did not lie there when I went to bed .
What things are these , my lord Antonio ?
Prithee , my king , be quiet .
Be you constant in the accusation , and my cunning shall not shame me .
Where the devil should this Romeo be ?
Come , seek the conspirators .
I'll be gone .
There may as well be amity and life 'Tween snow and fire , as treason and my love .
So be gone .
Never , my lord .
In your bad strokes , Brutus , you give good words .
Say , how is that ?
Brother , good night .
You shall mark Many a duteous and knee-crooking knave That ( doting on his own obsequious bondage ) Wears out his time much like his master's ass For naught but provender , and when he's old , cashiered .
She's dead , she's dead , she's dead !
You are welcome to Elsinore .
Fair youth , I would I could make thee believe I love .
They pray ; grant thou , lest faith turn to despair .
Is he gone ?
Oh , give us leave , great king , To view the field in safety and dispose Of their dead bodies .
What a thrice-double ass Was I , to take this drunkard for a god And worship this dull fool !
Is not , sir , my doublet as fresh as the first day I wore it ?
What may I call your name ?
Some say the lark makes sweet division .
No seconds ?
He's a traitor .
Tis some mischance , the cry is very direful .
How fine my master is !
Doth Fortune play the huswife with me now ?
The old man and his people Can not be well bestowed .
No !
What do you mean ?
What a pestilent knave is this same !
A dog of that house shall move me to stand .
My present business calls me from you now .
I do remember .
He uses his folly like a stalking-horse , and under the presentation of that he shoots his wit .
He comes upon a wish .
Look , here comes a lover of mine and a lover of hers .
Oh , 'tish ill done , 'tish ill done , by my hand , 'tish ill done .
Thou flea , thou nit , thou winter cricket thou !
I'll not meddle with him .
Thou hast not , cousin .
Two or three groan .
Sir Topas , Sir Topas , good Sir Topas , go to my lady , Out , hyperbolical fiend !
Here she comes , cursed and sad .
My other self , my council's consistory , My oracle , my prophet , my dear cousin , I , as a child , will go by thy direction Toward Ludlow then , for we'll not stay behind .
Then I beat my tabor , At which , like unbacked colts , they pricked their ears , Advanced their eyelids , lifted up their noses As they smelt music .
It proves not so .
Your reproof is something too round .
Where virtue is , these are more virtuous .
Why , anything .
He shall taste of my bottle .
Ay , for the state , not for Antonio .
With all my heart .
Where learned you this , Fool ?
My child , my only life , Revive , look up , or I will die with thee ! , Help , help !
Put on what weary negligence you please , You and your fellow servants .
Oh , rare for Antony !
All is lost !
A carrion death , within whose empty eye There is a written scroll .
I'll pluck thee berries .
Ha ?
Indeed , I never shall be satisfied With Romeo , till I behold him , dead , Is my poor heart for a kinsman vexed .
Drink thou .
My master , not myself , lacks recompense .
Past the mid season .
Let him approach .
Of her society Be not afraid .
Dear my lord , if you in your own proof Have vanquished the resistance of her youth And made defeat of her virginity , I know what you would say : if I have known her , You will say she did embrace me as a husband , And so extenuate the forehand sin .
Look to the lady .
Oh , he hath murdered his master !
The main descry Stands in the hourly thought .
You have served me well , And kings have been your fellows .
Dorset , embrace him. , Hastings , love Lord Marquess .
But 'tis all one ; 'tis alike as my fingers is to my fingers , and there is salmons in both .
Mend when thou canst .
Go and commend me to my brother Cassius .
I had rather have my horse to my mistress .
I know you not .
Mobled queen" is good .
Who is it ?
My brother Gloucester's voice. , Ay , I know thy errand .
Beware the ides of March .
There are no tongues else for 's turn .
Get thee to bed .
Look you , sad friends , The gods rebuke me , but it is tidings To wash the eyes of kings .
Why sweat they under burdens ?
For the poor wren , The most diminutive of birds , will fight , Her young ones in her nest , against the owl .
Let's see .
Oh , there has been much throwing about of brains .
How now , old lad ?
Antony Did tell me of you , bade me trust you , but I do not greatly care to be deceived , That have no use for trusting .
Peace , ho !
No , madam , no .
I afeard of him !
O my follies !
But now I was the lord Of this fair mansion , master of my servants , Queen o'er myself .
It is offended .
Will you help ? , An ass-head , and a coxcomb , and a knave , a thin-faced knave , a gull !
Come , father , I'll bestow you with a friend .
I must fetch his necessaries ashore .
Shall I attend your Grace ?
And if tomorrow Our navy thrive , I have an absolute hope Our landmen will stand up .
As birds do , Mother .
Fare you well .
The dram of evil Doth all the noble substance of a doubt To his own scandal .
No .
No , not he , though his face be better than any man's , yet his leg excels all men's , and for a hand and a foot and a body , though they be not to be talked on , yet they are past compare .
What promise , chuck ?
Oh , monstrous !
God almighty , There is some soul of goodness in things evil , Would men observingly distill it out .
Or shall I think in silver she's immured , Being ten times undervalued to tried gold ?
There , sir , stop .
An thou hadst been set i ' th ' stocks for that question , thou'dst well deserved it .
I will bandy with thee in faction .
I know not .
Here .
Ay , leeks is good .
What , has this thing appeared again tonight ?
What , Curio ?
Why sinks that cauldron ?
Come , go we to the king .
It is no matter .
Tie up my love's tongue .
My lord , I warrant you we will play our part As he shall think by our true diligence He is no less than what we say he is .
Saint Francis be my speed !
Come .
The Queen Of audience nor desire shall fail , so she From Egypt drive her all-disgraced friend Or take his life there .
Come hither , sirrah .
Do then , but I'll not hear .
But come thy ways .
Be choked with such another emphasis !
Oh , is this he ?
Signior , is all your family within ?
Why , he had none .
How goes it here ?
To whom in all this presence speaks your Grace ?
But one fiend at a time , I'll fight their legions o'er .
I will discharge it in either your straw-color beard , your orange-tawny beard , your purple-in-grain beard , or your French crown-color beard , your perfect yellow .
What is your will that I shall do with this ?
For youth is bought more oft than begged or borrow'd .
Tis better as it is .
Go you with me , uncle of Exeter .
They are so still , Or thou , the greatest soldier of the world , Art turned the greatest liar .
You'll bear me a bang for that , I fear .
Thou bring'st me out of tune .
Ah , how much might the man deserve of me that would right her !
No , make it two more .
I must love you and sue to know you better .
Hath there been such a time , I would fain know that , That I have positively said , "'Tis so , " When it proved otherwise ?
I will , my lord .
Good your highness , patience .
He that keeps nor crust nor crumb , Weary of all , shall want some .
Hence his ambition growing , Dost thou hear ?
If they do this , As , if God please , they shall , my ransom then Will soon be levied .
But I do think it is their husbands ' faults If wives do fall .
But you and I And honest Casca , we have the falling sickness .
You're fall'n into a princely hand .
Out of my sight !
Ay , when the special thing is well obtained , That is , her love , for that is all in all .
Soft and fair , Friar. , Which is Beatrice ?
But speak you this with a sad brow ?
Upon her landing , Antony sent to her , Invited her to supper .
One Angelo , a goldsmith .
I will not stay to offend you .
Awake !
For this slave , If there be any cunning cruelty That can torment him much and hold him long , It shall be his .
Lepidus is high-colored .
Here , wear this jewel for me .
Well , look unto it .
We two alone will sing like birds i ' th ' cage .
The fire seven times tried this , Seven times tried that judgment is , That did never choose amiss .
I often came where I did hear of her , but can not find her .
Gracious my lord , I should report that which I say I saw , But know not how to do 't .
I am one , sir , that comes to tell you your daughter and the Moor are now making the beast with two backs .

The king , the king's to blame .
O dear son Edgar , The food of thy abused father's wrath , Might I but live to see thee in my touch , I'd say I had eyes again !
Therefore , have done .
Your sword upon a woman ?
And most poor matters Point to rich ends .
Stirred up by Dorset , Buckingham , and Morton , He makes for England , here to claim the crown .
I feel this pinprick .
O flesh , flesh , how art thou fishified !
Let me go with him .
Feeling so the loss , Can not choose but ever weep the friend .
I'll join with black despair against my soul And to myself become an enemy .
Thanks , good my countryman .
What's Antony ?
Then move not , while my prayer's effect I take .
Fair lady , by your leave , I come by note to give and to receive .
A poor virgin , sir , an ill-favored thing , sir , but mine own .
There's a strong fellow , Menas .
And indeed , my lord , The wretched animal heaved forth such groans That their discharge did stretch his leathern coat Almost to bursting , and the big round tears Coursed one another down his innocent nose In piteous chase .
Are they so followed ?
These injuries the king now bears will be revenged home .
I partly know the man .
Good my lord , enter here .
Pat , pat .
I have not heard the clock .
What , from myself ?
Fetch me this herb , and be thou here again Ere the leviathan can swim a league .
I will do so .
Do not doubt , Cassio , But I will have my lord and you again As friendly as you were .
If it be so as so 'tis put on me , And that in way of caution , I must tell you , You do not understand yourself so clearly As it behooves my daughter and your honor .
For there is not a more fearful wildfowl than your lion living .
Come now , your promise .
That's all one .
Then meet me forthwith at the notary's .
Most noble sir , arise .
Who , Hero ?
I am none of these , my lord .
You would all this time have proved there is no time for all things .
If this were played upon a stage now , I could condemn it as an improbable fiction .
I weigh it lightly , were it heavier .
Reputation , reputation , reputation !
Yet thou liest in the bleak air .
Go to , go to .
Here's our chief guest .
I pity you .
Great Mark Antony Is now a widower .
The king comes here tonight .
Wouldst thou do such a deed for all the world ?
Hark !
O , fie , fie , fie !
Shall we go , coz ?
All this is comfort .
The spring , the summer , The childing autumn , angry winter change Their wonted liveries , and the mazed world , By their increase , now knows not which is which .
And yet my sky shall not want .
Ay , Casca .
These are news indeed !
The will !
I pray you tell me your remedy .
I pray you , commend me to Mistress Squash , your mother , and to Master Peascod , your father .
In Orsino's bosom .
Go and trim her up .
What think'st thou , will our friends prove all true ?
O , teach me how you look and with what art You sway the motion of Demetrius ' heart .
We will have more of this tomorrow .
If it be true that good wine needs no bush , 'tis true that a good play needs no epilogue .
What mean you , Caesar ?
Come , come , good wine is a good familiar creature , if it be well used .
Oh , but she is wise .
I pray you , father , being weak , seem so .
But not with such familiar instances Nor with such free and friendly conference As he hath used of old .
You gentle Romans , Peace , ho !
I am in this commanded to deliver The noble duke of Clarence to your hands .
For my part , I am so attired in wonder I know not what to say .
Many will swoon when they do look on blood .
Withdraw thee , wretched Margaret .
Twas he informed against him , And quit the house on purpose that their punishment Might have the freer course .
Why will My lord do so ?
Good fortune , worthy soldier , and farewell .
Madam .
Nay , I have offered all , I have no more , And she can have no more than all I have .
Therefore thy kinsmen are no stop to me .
An he should , it were an alms to hang him .
Well , for your favor , sir , why , give God thanks , and make no boast of it , and for your writing and reading , let that appear when there is no need of such vanity .
I am not of many words , but I thank you .
And then ?
I love thee not , therefore pursue me not .
Come , the recorders !
But for a fine , quaint , graceful , and excellent fashion , yours is worth ten on 't .
Here , here !
O notable strumpet !
Spake you with him ?
I warrant you , sir , The white cold virgin snow upon my heart Abates the ardor of my liver .
Why , thou sayst well .
And I'll still stay , to have thee still forget , Forgetting any other home but this .
Where is your sister , and Hortensio's wife ?
To who , my lord ? , Who hath the office ?
I think of as many matters as he , but I give heaven thanks and make no boast of them .
Do not fear our person .
There's strange news come , sir .
Dolabella !
How ?
I may not leave it so .
Done .
And here's another , Writ in my cousin's hand , stol'n from her pocket , Containing her affection unto Benedick .
Doth my simple feature content you ?
Let us hear what Antony can say .
What would you ?
The wren goes to 't , and the small gilded fly does lecher in my sight .
Shall I be plain ?
Why did you so cry out , sirs , in your sleep ?
Under Captain Gower , my liege .
You say very true , scald knave , when God's will is .
No such jade as you , if me you mean .
How came you , Cassio , by that handkerchief That was my wife's ?
Here thought they to have done Some wanton charm upon this man and maid , Whose vows are that no bed-right shall be paid Till Hymen's torch be lighted , but in vain .
What was 't That moved pale Cassius to conspire ?
It shall to the barber's , with your beard. , Prithee , say on .
Well moused , Lion !
I thank you , valiant Cassio .
And I .
I know thy quality .
Go tread the path that thou shalt ne'er return .
Not see him since ?
Say our pleasure , To such whose place is under us , requires Our quick remove from hence .
I'll yield him thee asleep , Where thou mayst knock a nail into his head .
But I am shepherd to another man And do not shear the fleeces that I graze .
How answer you for yourselves ?
Good dawning to thee , friend .
Farewell , hostess .
Didst thou not hear a noise ?
Tongue nor heart can not conceive nor name thee !
You could never do him so ill-well unless you were the very man .
You cataracts and hurricanoes , spout Till you have drenched our steeples , drowned the cocks !
A gentle riddance. , Draw the curtains , go. , Let all of his complexion choose me so .
Silence !
Yet could I bear that too , well , very well .
Music such as charmeth sleep !
He said the truth .
is your merry humor altered ?
I know you of old .
I will speak to this fellow. , Whose grave's this , sirrah ?
So please you .
Henry the Sixth , in infant bands crowned king Of France and England , did this king succeed , Whose state so many had the managing That they lost France and made his England bleed , Which oft our stage hath shown .
The king his master needs must take it ill , That he , so slightly valued in his messenger , Should have him thus restrained .
The enemy increaseth every day .
Masters , play here , I will content your pains .
Come , come , wrestle with thy affections .
Now go thy way .
This grief is crowned with consolation .
I remember You did supplant your brother Prospero .
By Dromio ?
Your son , my lord , has paid a soldier's debt .
You are very welcome , sir .
Thy shape invisible retain thou still .
Nor stony tower , nor walls of beaten brass , Nor airless dungeon , nor strong links of iron Can be retentive to the strength of spirit .
Up so .
Dispatch .
So ho !
And let him hold his fingers thus , and through that cranny shall Pyramus and Thisbe whisper .
By foul play , as thou sayst , were we heaved thence , But blessedly holp hither .
O , if thou wert the noblest of thy strain , Young man , thou couldst not die more honorable .
These fifteen years you have been in a dream Or , when you waked , so waked as if you slept .
How much I had to do to calm his rage !
Ay , sir , we are some of her trappings .
It may be so , my lord .
Thanks , sir : the like to you !
I do but beg a little changeling boy , To be my henchman .
When thou once Wast beaten from Modena , where thou slew'st Hirtius and Pansa , consuls , at thy heel Did famine follow , whom thou fought'st against , Though daintily brought up , with patience more Than savages could suffer .
Are our eyes our own ?
And say besides that in Aleppo once , Where a malignant and a turbaned Turk Beat a Venetian and traduced the state , I took by the throat the circumcised dog , And smote him , thus .
Thou know'st my daughter's of a pretty age .
How should that be ?
But come , I'll tell thee all my whole device When I am in my coach , which stays for us At the park gate .
Calphurnia's cheek is pale , and Cicero Looks with such ferret and such fiery eyes As we have seen him in the Capitol Being crossed in conference by some senators .
Therefore be cheered .
Hold !
Let them set on at once , for I perceive But cold demeanor in Octavius ' wing , And sudden push gives them the overthrow .
If they'll do neither , we will come to them And make them skirr away as swift as stones Enforced from the old Assyrian slings .
You need not tell us what Lord Hamlet said .
When we are born , we cry that we are come To this great stage of fools .
What , are they children ?
You speak to Casca , and to such a man That is no fleering telltale .
I have not art to reckon my groans , but that I love thee best , oh , most best , believe it .
We shall obey , were she ten times our mother .
What sayst thou to me now ?
Nor rain , wind , thunder , fire are my daughters .
An interlude !
I have stayed for thee , God knows , in torment and in agony .
The glowworm shows the matin to be near , And 'gins to pale his uneffectual fire .
Nay , 'tis no matter , sir , what he 'leges in Latin .
Oh , villainous !
For I am Trinculo , be not afeard , thy good friend Trinculo .
Help , help , help !
I'll plague him .
My lady would not lose him for more than I'll say .
What makes that frontlet on ?
Her vestal livery is but sick and green , And none but fools do wear it .
The lady of the Strachy married the yeoman of the wardrobe .
I could well forbear 't .
There lies the man , slain by young Romeo , That slew thy kinsman , brave Mercutio .
My own flesh and blood to rebel !
Speak , Count , 'tis your cue .
I see the jewel best enameled Will lose his beauty .
Thou shalt not back till I have borne this corse Into the marketplace .
Have you a mind to sink ?
Twenty crowns .
Come , go we to the king .
All is confirmed , my lord , which was reported .
Do not deny to him that you love me .
O villain , thou hast stolen both mine office and my name !
Now , for I know the Breton Richmond aims At young Elizabeth , my brother's daughter , And by that knot looks proudly on the crown , To her go I , a jolly thriving wooer .
Hath Romeo slain himself ?
With her , on her , what you will .
Farewell , good Charles .
It fell upon a little western flower , Before milk-white , now purple with love's wound .
Your eyes are lodestars , and your tongue's sweet air More tunable than lark to shepherd's ear When wheat is green , when hawthorn buds appear .
You praise yourself By laying defects of judgment to me , but You patched up your excuses .
I slept the next night well , fed well , was free and merry .
I look down towards his feet , but that's a fable .
I hate ingratitude more in a man Than lying , vainness , babbling , drunkenness , Or any taint of vice whose strong corruption Inhabits our frail blood , O heavens themselves !
I answer you ?
Therefore , most gracious duke , with thy command Let him be brought forth and borne hence for help .
I have possessed your grace of what I purpose , And by our holy Sabbath have I sworn To have the due and forfeit of my bond .
Cassius , be constant .
I had been happy if the general camp , Pioneers and all , had tasted her sweet body , So I had nothing known .
And only in that safety died her brothers .
Till then , lead thou first .
Well then , Legitimate Edgar , I must have your land .
I know his heart .
I have forgot why I did call thee back .
Why , the enemy is loud .
The foul'st best fits My latter part of life .
Is this face Hero's ?
No , you shall pardon me .
Or , if sour woe delights in fellowship And needly will be ranked with other griefs , Why followed not , when she said "Tybalt's dead , " "Thy father" or "thy mother , " nay , or both , Which modern lamentations might have moved ?
We have not yet set down this day of triumph .
An he speak any thing against me , I'll take him down , an he were lustier than he is , and twenty such Jacks .
Nor no one here , for curses never pass The lips of those that breathe them in the air .
Ay , but ( by your leave ) not before me .
Give you good morrow , sir .
What , i ' th ' storm , i ' th ' night ?
A foolish heart , that I leave here behind .
Madam , if you could find out but a man To bear a poison , I would temper it , That Romeo should , upon receipt thereof , Soon sleep in quiet .
Oh , treason of the blood !
The rest march on with me .
If either of you know any inward impediment why you should not be conjoined , charge you on your souls to utter it .
O , 'twas the foulest deed to slay that babe , And the most merciless that e'er was heard of !
A most poor man made tame to fortune's blows , Who by the art of known and feeling sorrows Am pregnant to good pity .
You might have saved me my pains to have taken it away yourself .
You shall not find , Though you be therein curious , the least cause For what you seem to fear .
Kneel to the duke before he pass the abbey .
He goes before me and still dares me on .
I am in your debt for your last exercise .
That dreamers often lie .
I humbly do beseech you of your pardon For too much loving you .
I assure my good liege , I hold my duty as I hold my soul , Both to my God and to my gracious king .
Cesario , come , For so you shall be , while you are a man .
Please , let me stay .
Oh yes , I saw sweet beauty in her face Such as the daughter of Agenor had , That made great Jove to humble him to her hand When with his knees he kissed the Cretan strand .
I was of late as petty to his ends As is the morn-dew on the myrtle leaf To his grand sea .
Ay , a thousand times. , Peter !
Speak , I charge you .
Oh , then , what graces in my love do dwell , That he hath turned a heaven unto a hell !
I have told thee often , and I re-tell thee again and again , I hate the Moor .
God hath blessed you with a good name .
So out went the candle and we were left darkling .
No , my lord .
He bears him like a portly gentleman , And , to say truth , Verona brags of him To be a virtuous and well-governed youth .
But thou wouldst not think how ill all's here about my heart .
And for three months .
How comes this trick upon him ?
See how beastly she doth court him !
If he be taken , he shall never more Be feared of doing harm .
You have good judgment in horsemanship .
Shall I be frighted when a madman stares ?
Knock , sir ?
Money by me !
A most unhappy one .
O , wilt thou leave me so unsatisfied ?
Ay , I do .
Therefore tremble and depart .
Therefore perpend , my princess , and give ear .
Filths savor but themselves .
Rebellious dead , rise never till the wood Of Birnam rise , and our high-placed Macbeth Shall live the lease of nature , pay his breath To time and mortal custom .
Oh , falsely , falsely murdered !
Beauty provoketh thieves sooner than gold .
Grant their lawful suit .
Well demanded , wench .
Let no fair be kept in mind But the fair of Rosalind .
The itch of his affection should not then Have nicked his captainship at such a point When half to half the world opposed , he being The mered question .
It is a great price for a small vice .
So shall you feel the loss , but not the friend Which you weep for .
What's the matter ?
When the wind is southerly , I know a hawk from a handsaw .
I hear it now above me .
Make haste , I say .
But what of that ?
I like not that .
But mark , poor knight , What dreadful dole is here !
Behold the threaden sails , Borne with th ' invisible and creeping wind , Draw the huge bottoms through the furrowed sea , Breasting the lofty surge .
Thy husband in thy bosom there lies dead , And Paris too .
With all my heart , so thou canst get a wife .
Tis expressly against the law of arms .
Yea , marry , dost thou hear , Balthasar ?
Well be with you , gentlemen .
Zounds , a dog , a rat , a mouse , a cat to scratch a man to death !
Come , shall we hear this music ?
If you do not , if I be left alone , Now , by mine honor , which is yet mine own , I'll have that doctor for my bedfellow .
Wouldst thou do such a deed for all the world ?
Speak !
Be merciful , say "death , " For exile hath more terror in his look , Much more than death .
Your Grace attended to their sugared words But looked not on the poison of their hearts .
Discern'st thou aught in that ?
To our shores Throng many doubtful hollow-hearted friends , Unarmed and unresolved to beat them back .
Mum , then , and no more .
Look , he wears cruel garters .
Nay , that you shall not .
Any strange beast there makes a man .
How is 't , Laertes ?
For then I'll marry Warwick's youngest daughter .
Let me entreat you .
Think , my lord ? " Alas , thou echo'st me As if there were some monster in thy thought Too hideous to be shown .
Four days will quickly steep themselves in night .
Prithee bear some charity to my wit .
A king , a king !
Thou hast by moonlight at her window sung With feigning voice verses of feigning love , And stol'n the impression of her fantasy With bracelets of thy hair , rings , gauds , conceits , Knacks , trifles , nosegays , sweetmeats , messengers Of strong prevailment in unhardened youth .
Yare , lower , lower !
Be not afraid .
What , what ?
He hath confessed .
Biondello , what of that ?
O wonderful son that can so 'stonish a mother !
Here's his dry hand up and down .
Hear me , my lord .
Up , up , and see The great doom's image !
Horatio , thou art e'en as just a man As e'er my conversation coped withal .
It is the part of men to fear and tremble When the most mighty gods by tokens send Such dreadful heralds to astonish us .
Who comes here ?
Is Banquo gone from court ?
These be the Christian husbands .
He , upon some action , Is now in durance at Malvolio's suit , A gentleman and follower of my lady's .
Comes not that blood as modest evidence To witness simple virtue ?
The bounty and the benison of heaven To boot and boot .
And yet I would not be thee , nuncle .
But say , my lord , it were not registered , Methinks the truth should live from age to age , As 'twere retailed to all posterity , Even to the general all-ending day .
Famine is in thy cheeks .
The skies are painted with unnumbered sparks .
I'll then nor give nor hazard aught for lead .
But as all is mortal in nature , so is all nature in love mortal in folly .
I can not tell .
Need you my help ?
Good !
Safely stowed .
How chance the king comes with so small a train ?
Well , my dread lord , so must I call you now .
I shall obey you .
What mean you , sir ?
Hark how our steeds for present service neigh .
What drink'st thou oft , instead of homage sweet , But poisoned flattery ?
Was that done like Cassius ?
Do you put tricks upon 's with savages and men of Ind , ha ?
Villain am I none .
Let me stand here till thou remember it .
Good morrow , masters .
Would it were mortal poison for thy sake .
He can not live , I hope , and must not die Till George be packed with post-horse up to heaven .
He ran this way and leapt this orchard wall .
With meditating that she must die once , I have the patience to endure it now .
Ah , ha , my lord , this prince is not an Edward !
Look upon Caesar .
Vengeance , plague , death , confusion !
Tis something , nothing : 'T was mine , 'tis his , and has been slave to thousands .
Tis true .
Now , the next day Was our sea fight , and what to this was sequent Thou know'st already .
Ay me , most wretched , That have my heart parted betwixt two friends That does afflict each other !
A Roman .
I will be hanged , if some eternal villain , Some busy and insinuating rogue , Some cogging , cozening slave , to get some office , Have not devised this slander .
Whither away ?
Will you to Scone ?
That's a question .
He dies that strikes again .
For that he dares us to 't .
The question of his death is enrolled in the Capitol .
But swords I smile at , weapons laugh to scorn , Brandished by man that's of a woman born .
Your bedchamber .
Nor ever heard , nor ever did suspect .
Speak .
Obey you , love you , and most honor you .
So are the Prince and Claudio , who accused her Upon the error that you heard debated .
Sir , good success .
Troth , my lord , I have played the part of Lady Fame .
Or if thou follow me , do not believe But I shall do thee mischief in the wood .
It might , my lord .
Ah , dear , if I be so , From my cold heart let heaven engender hail , And poison it in the source , and the first stone Drop in my neck .
And , hark !
You make me study of that .
So dear I loved the man that I must weep .
My love doth so approve him That even his stubbornness , his checks , his frowns , Prithee , unpin me , have grace and favor .
Alone , it was the subject of my theme ; In company I often glanced it .
Then say at once what is it thou requests .
Come , brother ; away !
To Caesar will I render My legions and my horse .
Over thy wounds now do I prophesy , Which , like dumb mouths , do ope their ruby lips To beg the voice and utterance of my tongue , A curse shall light upon the limbs of men .
The foul practice Hath turned itself on me .
Treachery !
All may be well enough .
Orsino .
Love is merely a madness and , I tell you , deserves as well a dark house and a whip as madmen do , and the reason why they are not so punished and cured is that the lunacy is so ordinary that the whippers are in love , too .
Then there is the County Palatine .
I shifted him away And laid good 'scuses upon your ecstasy ,
Canst thou so daff me ?
It is perchance that you yourself were saved .
Nay , I am sure it is , Volumnius .
Here comes Lorenzo .
I would have such a fellow whipped for o'erdoing Termagant .
Ay , there's the villany .
The god of Jupiter .
Where , where , Messala , doth his body lie ?
Pray you , is he married to Cleopatra ?
Though far more cause , yet much less spirit to curse Abides in me .
Sleep thou , and I will wind thee in my arms .
Then I would you were so honest a man .
Give me a living reason she's disloyal .
But first I will release the fairy queen .
Sir , I lack advancement .
If from the field I shall return once more To kiss these lips , I will appear in blood .
Himself in person there ?
This ring , good sir , alas , it is a trifle .
O God of battles , steel my soldiers ' hearts .
To fetch my poor distracted husband hence .
I pray thee , moralize them .
Not a word of me .
Wherefore , sweetheart ?
I'll follow it .
I will be correspondent to command And do my spiriting gently .
Be'st thou sad or merry , The violence of either thee becomes , So does it no man else. , Mett'st thou my posts ?
If he be sad , he wants money .
Why should she write to Edmund ?
Your reason .
But for the bloody napkin ?
Let them not live to taste this land's increase , That would with treason wound this fair land's peace .
Wast thou not charged at peril , Wherefore to Dover ? , Let him first answer that .
Your statue spouting blood in many pipes , In which so many smiling Romans bathed , Signifies that from you great Rome shall suck Reviving blood , and that great men shall press For tinctures , stains , relics , and cognizance .
O , good sir , I do .
Since Cassius first did whet me against Caesar , I have not slept .
Well aimed of such a young one .
I am unfit for state and majesty .
For this pains Caesar hath hanged him .
O my good lord , Believe not all , or , if you must believe , Stomach not all .
Why , then let's home again .
What , art thou waking ?
Some to Ligarius ' .
I am ready .
If I see anything tonight why I should not marry her , tomorrow in the congregation , where I should wed , there will I shame her .
It is his .
And from henceforth When you are over-earnest with your Brutus , He'll think your mother chides and leave you so .
Go you and prepare Aliena , for look you , here comes my Rosalind .
Let's follow it , and after do our work .
Soldiers , sir .
You draw me , you hard-hearted adamant .
Caesar himself has work , and our oppression Exceeds what we expected .
A night is but small breath and little pause To answer matters of this consequence .
Take me up .
Do 't , knight .
I hear a tongue , shriller than all the music , Cry "Caesar ! " , Speak .
That can not be , since I am still possessed Of those effects for which I did the murder : My crown , mine own ambition , and my queen .
Go thou with me , and let me counsel thee .
Have you had quiet guard ?
Romeo's a dishclout to him .
Prepare the body then , and follow us .
Come on .
My bones would rest , That have but labored to attain this hour .
I nursed her daughter that you talked withal .
Or image of that horror ?
Is Cassius near ?
You are not Pinch's patient , are you , sir ?
Peace , ho , for shame !
But let it be .
That's strange .
Is not your lord honorable without marriage ?
With sweetest touches pierce your mistress ' ear , And draw her home with music .
If in thy wisdom thou canst give no help , Do thou but call my resolution wise , And with this knife I'll help it presently .
Had he his hurts before ?
Sweet lady , you have given me life and living .
Here at your service .
To this chair bind him. , Villain , thou shalt find , By the kind gods , 'tis most ignobly done To pluck me by the beard .
I am sorry that your leisure serves you not. , Antonio , gratify this gentleman , For in my mind you are much bound to him .
Or did the letters work upon his blood And new-create his fault ?
Yea , just so much as you may take upon a knife's point and choke a daw withal .
What tributaries follow him to Rome To grace in captive bonds his chariot wheels ?
I'll back to the duke of Gloucester and tell him so .
The gods forbid !
Caesar shall forth .
Why , very well then .
Sweet soul , let's in , and there expect their coming .
Thou'rt i ' the right .
Are you sure of that ?
Cassio did top her , ask thy husband else .
What , with my tongue in your tail ?
Thou art The armorer of my heart .
Let the doors be shut upon him , that he may play the fool no where but in 's own house .
For whose sake did I that ill deed ?
Well , Brutus , thou art noble .
Our purposes God justly hath discovered , And I repent my fault more than my death , Which I beseech Your Highness to forgive , Although my body pay the price of it .
Didst thou not hear somebody ?
And hath challenged thee ?
Machinations , hollowness , treachery , and all ruinous disorders follow us disquietly to our graves .
For this , be sure , tonight thou shalt have cramps , Side-stitches that shall pen thy breath up .
Tis Banquo's then .
Hence , and stand aloof .
We'll no more meet , no more see one another .
Away , Tybalt .
How now ?
I am an ass , I am a woman's man , and besides myself .
They were villains , murderers .
Master , go on , and I will follow thee To the last gasp , with truth and loyalty .
Is the king stirring , worthy thane ?
How does my bounteous sister ?
In happy time here comes the duke himself .
Thou dost conspire against thy friend , Iago , If thou but think'st him wronged and mak'st his ear A stranger to thy thoughts .
Where art thou , Death ?
What art thou , fellow ?
In , or we are spoiled .
Why , we are still handling our ewes , and their fells , you know , are greasy .
Here on her breast There is a vent of blood , and something blown .
Tis nine o'clock .
Is 't possible ?
Are his wits safe ?
Let him approach .
His folly , Helena , is no fault of mine .
My determinate voyage is mere extravagancy .
By this marriage , All little jealousies , which now seem great , And all great fears , which now import their dangers , Would then be nothing .
It provokes the desire , but it takes away the performance .
But look to it : Find out thy brother , wheresoe'er he is .
And out of doubt you do me now more wrong In making question of my uttermost Than if you had made waste of all I have .
Hear you , sir ?
But , hark thee , Charmian .
And by how much she strives to do him good She shall undo her credit with the Moor .
My most dear lord !
Ay , 'twas he that told me on her first .
Do the boys carry it away ?
Thou hast wronged Caius Ligarius .
Death and damnation !
I have professed me thy friend , and I confess me knit to thy deserving with cables of perdurable toughness .
In all these circumstances I'll instruct you .
There's hell , there's darkness , there's the sulfurous pit , burning , scalding , stench , consumption !
Tis so strange That , though the truth of it stands off as gross As black and white , my eye will scarcely see it .
Of what nature the wrongs are thou hast done him , I know not , but thy intercepter , full of despite , bloody as the hunter , attends thee at the orchard end .
Those uncles which you want were dangerous .
May one be pardoned and retain th ' offense ?
His daughter is to be brought by you to the supper .
Last thing he did , dear Queen , He kissed , the last of many doubled kisses , This orient pearl .
Mistake me not .
You see how simple and how fond I am .
No man must know." If this should be thee , Malvolio ?
If it please the eye of one , it is with me as the very true sonnet is , "Please one , and please all." Why , how dost thou , man ?
These things sting His mind so venomously that burning shame Detains him from Cordelia .
Hush and be mute , Or else our spell is marred .
When devils will the blackest sins put on They do suggest at first with heavenly shows As I do now .
No man must know." What follows ?
My mind was never yet more mercenary .
You know the character to be your brother's ?
Wert thou not banished on pain of death ?
I say , but mark his gesture .
So should a murderer look , so dead , so grim .
And is it physical To walk unbraced and suck up the humors Of the dank morning ?
I care not for good life .
Is he alone ?
And if you leave me so , you do me wrong .
I with the morning's love have oft made sport , And like a forester the groves may tread Even till the eastern gate , all fiery red , Opening on Neptune with fair blessed beams , Turns into yellow gold his salt green streams .
Then he shall have no odds .
And yet it is not : it is but so-so .
Advantage is a better soldier than rashness .
Here comes his Majesty .
Who sued to me for him ?
Nay , pray you throw none away .
Make her amends , she weeps .
Give me the gown .
Adultery ?
You speak too bitterly .
O bear me witness , night , What man is this ?
Alack the day !
Tis not for gravity to play at cherry-pit with Satan .
Cursed be I that did so !
O Iras , Charmian !
And I have heard Apollodorus carried , What , I pray you ?
Will it never be day ?
Is 't not denounced against us ?
We have lost best half of our affair .
My Lord High Constable , the English lie within fifteen hundred paces of your tents .
Then none have I offended .
We have none such , sir .
And in assemblies too .
Approach , my Ariel , come .
Here comes the Prince and Claudio hastily .
The last of all the Romans , fare thee well !
Wilt break my heart ?
Let me see your eyes .
Let's see for means .
That which you are , my thoughts can not transpose .
Dost thou squiny at me ?
Declare thine office .
Do you perceive in all this noble company Where most you owe obedience ?
Let me yet know of you whither you are bound .
Madam , good night .
No king of England if not king of France .
You are a merry man , sir .
Let's do so .
It is shaped , sir , like itself , and it is as broad as it hath breadth .
Will not the mayor then and his brethren come ?
Why did you laugh then , when I said "man delights not me" ?
I would my horse had the speed of your tongue and so good a continuer .
Fare you well , my liege .
Therefore thou must be hanged at the state's charge .
I do suspect I have done some offense That seems disgracious in the city's eye , And that you come to reprehend my ignorance .
In troth , I think thou wouldst not .
Upon the corner of the moon There hangs a vap'rous drop profound .
And after that he came thus sad away ?
The king's a bawcock , and a heart of gold , A lad of life , an imp of fame , Of parents good , of fist most valiant .
One ?
But why should honor outlive honesty ?
That were the most if he should husband you .
And for my means , I'll husband them so well , They shall go far with little .
Unmerciful lady as you are , I'm none .
Under Sir Thomas Erpingham .
But this is most falliable , the worm's an odd worm .
I shall be pinched to death .
If we walk not in the trodden paths our very petticoats will catch them .
Put out the light , and then put out the light .
Proculeius , What thou hast done thy master Caesar knows , And he hath sent for thee .
Welcome , lady .
Keep your purse .
My name is Roderigo .
No more amazement .
And I the king shall love thee .
Tell her I am arrested in the street , And that shall bail me .
God save your Majesty .
Nine or ten times I had thought t ' have yerked him here under the ribs .
In Sicyon .
Maybe the letter moved him , For , as I think , they do command him home , Deputing Cassio in his government .
Why then , he is alive .
Being so frustrate , tell him , he mocks The pauses that he makes .
Even those you were wont to take delight in , the tragedians of the city .
Oh !
The voice of Cassio .
Riotous madness , To be entangled with those mouth-made vows Which break themselves in swearing !
Who's his lieutenant , hear you ?
Thou dost infect mine eyes .
Very brief , and to exceeding good sense , less .
Speak not so grossly. , You are all amazed .
Marry , sir , they praise me and make an ass of me , now my foes tell me plainly I am an ass .
Farewell , father .
Come , shall we go and kill us venison ?
Thy dukedom I resign and do entreat Thou pardon me my wrongs .
Of a snail ?
She had a song of "Willow , " An old thing 'twas , but it expressed her fortune And she died singing it .
You do love my lord .
Sir , sir , sir ,
Gods and goddesses , All the whole synod of them !
She will be pleased .
Men must not walk too late .
This is the fruits of rashness .
Neither to you nor any one , having no witness to confirm my speech .
It would be spoke to .
It would become me As well as it does you , and I should do it With much more ease , for my good will is to it And yours it is against .
I'll rather kill myself .
Very well , " "go to" !
I fear you have sold your own lands to see other men's .
Yea , " quoth my husband , "Fall'st upon thy face ?
What kind of help ?
I cry you mercy , uncle. , By your Grace's pardon .
Bless thy five wits .
Caesar and he are greater friends than ever .
Signor Antonio Commends him to you .
I mean , my head upon your lap ?
Yes , sir .
Run to the Capitol , and nothing else ?
What answer , sir ?
God 'ild you , sir .
Give him this money and these notes , Reynaldo .
I go , I go .
Well , sir , I thank you .
There is no more to say ?
And then give them great meals of beef and iron and steel , they will eat like wolves and fight like devils .
All things that are , Are with more spirit chased than enjoyed .
Wilt thou have music ?
What is thy news then ?
Brutus , my country's friend .
Attend the lords of France and Burgundy , Gloucester .
Why , that's my dainty Ariel .
Good Ursula , wake my cousin Beatrice and desire her to rise .
Tis true , my brother's daughter's Queen of Tunis , So is she heir of Naples , 'twixt which regions There is some space .
Do you see this , O God ?
I could make as true a boast as that if I had a sow to my mistress .
Not a word .
Very well , my lord .
Revenges burn in them , for their dear causes Would to the bleeding and the grim alarm Excite the mortified man .
Ay , but , lady , That policy may either last so long , Or feed upon such nice and waterish diet , Or breed itself so out of circumstances , That , I being absent and my place supplied , My general will forget my love and service .
Oh , then we bring forth weeds When our quick minds lie still , and our ills told us Is as our earing .
Sweet now , silence .
I hear the minstrels play .
Not stingless too ?
Come , more , another stanzo .
It now draws toward night .
Yea , my lord , but I can cross it .
Therefore speak no more .
Now your jest is earnest .
Not I .
I'll find out your man , And he shall signify from time to time Every good hap to you that chances here .
These couchings and these lowly courtesies Might fire the blood of ordinary men And turn preordinance and first decree Into the law of children .
Tis neither here nor there .
He is arrived .
You're sad , Signior Balthasar .
The sound is going away .
Where's the Master ?
Bring me but to the very brim of it , And I'll repair the misery thou dost bear With something rich about me .
I have a daughter , have while she is mine , Who in her duty and obedience , mark , Hath given me this .
Why ?
Keep your word , Phoebe , that you'll marry me Or else , refusing me , to wed this shepherd .
Burn !
Nay , that's not your way .
Farewell .
What's the matter ?
Fare thee well .
He will to his Egyptian dish again .
I will weep for thee , For this revolt of thine methinks is like Another fall of man. , Their faults are open .
I found not Cassio's kisses on her lips .
Come , therefore , and to Thasos send his body .
Then shall the sighs of Octavia blow the fire up in Caesar , and , as I said before , that which is the strength of their amity shall prove the immediate author of their variance .
Who shall bar me from them ?
And yet complainest thou of obstruction ?
These babes for Clarence weep and so do I ; I for an Edward weep ; so do not they .
A halter gratis , nothing else , for God's sake .
He is welcome too .
Avoid what is to come .
Now , infidel , I have you on the hip .
Antony will use his affection where it is .
Ah , Buckingham , now do I play the touch , To try if thou be current gold indeed .
So may you lose your arms .
Good e'en , good e'en .
Unwilling , I agreed .
Thou hast braved many men ; brave not me .
You wrong me every way .
What's his fault ?
Jove's lightning , the precursors O ' th ' dreadful thunderclaps , more momentary And sight-outrunning were not .
O hated potion , hence !
Your Majesty came not like yourself .
Are there balance here to weigh The flesh ?
Thus I let you go And give you to the gods .
Do , good friend .
You tallow face !
By Jove that thunders !
Thine , Claudio , thine , I say .
Thou mightst have done this without thy beard and gown .
A third can not be matched unless the devil himself turn Jew .
There , take it ; and much thanks for my good cheer .
Borrow Cupid's wings And soar with them above a common bound .
Do not answer me .
Look in upon me then and speak with me , Or , naked as I am , I will assault thee .
Tis true , my liege ; this ring I had of her .
If they speak but truth of her , These hands shall tear her ; if they wrong her honor , The proudest of them shall well hear of it .
Ere I ope his letter , I pray you tell me how my good friend doth .
Too familiar Is my dear son with such sour company .
What shall I swear by ?
What's the boy Malcolm ?
Little" again ?
Rather on Nilus' mud Lay me stark naked and let the waterflies Blow me into abhorring .
Wilt thou lift up Olympus ?
What Adam dost thou mean ?
Yes , faith .
I am a spirit of no common rate .
And this report Hath so exasperated the king that he Prepares for some attempt of war .
If she had been blessed , she would never have loved the Moor .
An thou let part so , Sir Andrew , would thou mightst never draw sword again .
When I am known aright you shall not grieve Lending me this acquaintance .
At mine own house , good lady .
Art not thou the Lady Olivia's fool ?
Fouler than heart can think thee , thou canst make No excuse current but to hang thyself .
By Jupiter , Were I the wearer of Antonio's beard , I would not shave 't today .

If he distaste it , let him to our sister , Whose mind and mine I know in that are one , Not to be overruled .
Find out this villain , Edmund .
Who was 't came by ?
I am no fighter .
Whither are they vanished ?
But I do prophesy the election lights On Fortinbras .
Be of good cheer .
And I for Rosalind .
And so will I .
For this time I will leave you .
God make incision in thee ; thou art raw .
How died my master , Strato ?
God will revenge it .
I know it well , sir .
We'll speak to them , and tonight I'll force The wine peep through their scars. , Come on , my Queen , There's sap in 't yet .
When he returns from hunting , I will not speak with him .
What's that to thee ?
Fathers commonly Do get their children .
Peter Quince , What sayest thou , bully Bottom ?
Nay , I'll conjure too !
No , Kate ?
Shine out , fair sun , till I have bought a glass , That I may see my shadow as I pass .
Why , how now , monsieur ?
I was born to speak all mirth and no matter .
And this our life , exempt from public haunt , Finds tongues in trees , books in the running brooks , Sermons in stones , and good in everything .
A hundred marks , my Kate does put her down .
Now , by the world , 'T is full of thy foul wrongs .
I shall grow jealous of you shortly , Launcelot , if you thus get my wife into corners .
Will you , I pray , demand that demi-devil Why he hath thus ensnared my soul and body ?
But that you do not love me .
O lamentable day !
Madam , it so fell out , that certain players We o'erraught on the way .
But seven years since , in Syracusa , boy , Thou know'st we parted .
Hast thou affections ?
Wherefore rejoice ?
Alas now , pray you , Work not so hard .
Oh , are you come , Iago ?
Think upon Vaughan , and with guilty fear Let fall thy lance .
Faith , sir , you need not fear .
Madam , I will .
My father was no traitor .
Thus hath he lost sixpence a day during his life .
No marrying 'mong his subjects ?
My letters say a hundred and seven galleys .
Or he that slew her brothers and her uncles ?
And he that hath commanded is our king .
But it is no English treason to cut French crowns , and tomorrow the king himself will be a clipper .
Ay , in the temple , in the town , the field You do me mischief .
What if my house be troubled with a rat And I be pleased to give ten thousand ducats To have it baned ?
I am sorry I beat thee .
Sweet bodements !
Their battles are at hand .
Tis a point of wisdom .
Take hence this jack and whip him .
Speak , Agrippa .
What is thy name ?
Well , we shall see your bearing .
Heaven and earth !
I will make myself known to Desdemona .
And now , good friends , As you are friends , scholars and soldiers , Give me one poor request .
Tell me , how fares our loving mother ?
How doth my lady ?
The town sounds a parley .
O me !
Nay , you must call me Rosalind. , Come , sister , will you go ?
One stroke Shall free thee from the tribute which thou payest .
Five summers have I spent in farthest Greece , Roaming clean through the bounds of Asia , And , coasting homeward , came to Ephesus , Hopeless to find , yet loath to leave unsought Or that or any place that harbors men .
There lies that Tybalt .
I do beseech your lordship , call her back .
I say I love thee more than he can do .
He can not be heard of .
I pray you do .
Our general's wife is now the general .
No , I will not .
Trust me , I fear it has .
Out o ' tune , sir .
When spake I such a word ?
If I lose a scruple of this sport , let me be boiled to death with melancholy .
The Count Claudio shall marry the daughter of Leonato .
Where's Antony ?
And did you see the handkerchief ?
Note this before my notes : There's not a note of mine that's worth the noting .
What , ho , Brabantio !
Tis here .
So was I when your Highness took his dukedom .
Gloucester's eyes ?
Let me see her .
One dead , or drunk ?
Why , how now , Dromio .
Good Lord for alliance !
Dolabella !
No child but Hero ; she's his only heir .
Fly ?
They know your Grace hath cause and means and might ; So hath your Highness .
Bind up my wounds !
Nor shalt not till necessity be served .
Then must you speak Of one that loved not wisely , but too well .
What was thy cause ?
You have said now .
God grant that some , less noble and less loyal , Nearer in bloody thoughts , and not in blood , Deserve not worse than wretched Clarence did , And yet go current from suspicion .
Saw you the king today , my lord of Derby ?
Yea , and paid me richly for the practice of it .
Farewell .
They say , one Taurus .
You come not Like Caesar's sister .
Yours , if you talk of tales .
Her father loved me , oft invited me , Still questioned me the story of my life From year to year , the battles , sieges , fortunes , That I have passed .
Why Doth it not then our eyelids sink ?
Good morrow , Benedick .
Sir ?
And now forward with thy tale .
Troth , no , no more than reason .
Nobody come ?
What , wilt thou flout me thus unto my face , Being forbid ?
Leave me , I pray , a little .
The four strangers seek for you , madam , to take their leave .
Therefore , Go , clear thy crystals. , Yoke-fellows in arms , Let us to France , like horse-leeches , my boys , To suck , to suck , the very blood to suck .
This jest shall cost me some expense .
But there is never a fair woman has a true face .
When I came back , For this was brief , I found them close together At blow and thrust , even as again they were When you yourself did part them .
Trouble yourselves no further .
With duty and desire we follow you .
Flatterers ? , Now , Brutus , thank yourself .
It eats and sleeps and hath such senses As we have , such .
Oh , I were damned beneath all depth in hell , But that I did proceed upon just grounds To this extremity .
Ay , but not yet to die !
He shall not live .
To tell you where he lodges is to tell you where I lie .
But well .
This fellow's of exceeding honesty And knows all quantities , with a learned spirit , Of human dealings .
Give me Bianca for my patrimony .
Ere it be demanded , As like enough it will , I would have it copied .
Our posts shall be swift and intelligent betwixt us. , Farewell , dear sister .
Cesario , you do not keep promise with me .
I partly feel thee .
Who comes so fast in silence of the night ?
Why , such is love's transgression .
You are full of pretty answers .
Why look you pale ?
An now tell me , how doth your cousin ?
Say what you will , sir , but I know what I know .
But I will wed thee in another key , With pomp , with triumph , and with reveling .
And for his dreams , I wonder he's so simple To trust the mock'ry of unquiet slumbers .
Thrice the brinded cat hath mewed .
We have sworn , my lord , already .
If she be in her chamber or your house , Let loose on me the justice of the state For thus deluding you .
Hard , hard. , O filthy traitor !
I wis , your grandam had a worser match .
Pray heaven it be State matters , as you think , and no conception Nor no jealous toy concerning you .
This is a practise As full of labor as a wise man's art , For folly that he wisely shows is fit .
Tomorrow , Caesar , I shall be furnished to inform you rightly Both what by sea and land I can be able To front this present time .
For we will fetters put upon this fear , Which now goes too free-footed .
I gave him no order .
I did not think you could have been so angry .
This is not the way To win your daughter .
I do not think it good .
Yes indeed .
Set your countenance , sir .
See how they kiss and court !
What is your difference ?
Maybe he is not well .
Why , what should you fear ?
The French might have a good prey of us if he knew of it , for there is none to guard it but boys .
Tis very true .
Seest thou here , This is the mouth o ' th ' cell .
Hence , and avoid my sight ! , So be my grave my peace as here I give Her father's heart from her. , Call France .
I never saw the chain , so help me heaven , And this is false you burden me withal .
Go look after him .
What shall we do else ?
He is all the mother's , from the top to toe .
But , my good lord , Wherefore should you do this ?
I have too grieved a heart To take a tedious leave .
Every subject's duty is the king's , but every subject's soul is his own .
She's full of most blessed condition .
I am old now , And these same crosses spoil me .
Tell me what more thou know'st .
Look you here , Here is himself , marred , as you see , with traitors .
Night's candles are burnt out , and jocund day Stands tiptoe on the misty mountain tops .
It was the nightingale , and not the lark , That pierced the fearful hollow of thine ear .
O ill-dispersing wind of misery !
Bear free and patient thoughts .
Take up my mistress ' gown for thy master's use !
He swore he would never marry , and yet now , in despite of his heart , he eats his meat without grudging .
Yea , Signior , and depart when you bid me .
Hence "banished" is banished from the world , And world's exile is death .
Oh , that we then could come by Caesar's spirit And not dismember Caesar !
And yet to win her , all the world to nothing !
The last she spake Was "Antony , most noble Antony ! " Then in the midst a tearing groan did break The name of Antony .
To serve me well , you all should do me duty : Teach me to be your queen , and you my subjects .
Nor will you not tell me who you are ?
Hail , mortal .
And he that will not follow Bourbon now , Let him go hence , and with his cap in hand Like a base pander hold the chamber door , Whilst by a slave , no gentler than my dog , His fairest daughter is contaminate .
Contending with the fretful elements .
Good morrow , Casca. , Caius Ligarius , Caesar was ne'er so much your enemy As that same ague which hath made you lean .
The hour steals on .
Gramercies , Tranio , well dost thou advise .
That ?
If a Christian do not play the knave and get thee , I am much deceived .
Your castle is surprised , your wife and babes Savagely slaughtered .
What is to be said to him , lady ?
I'll keep my oath Patiently to bear my wroth."
I did not kill your husband .
The more fool , madonna , to mourn for your brother's soul being in heaven .
The day is broke .
Retire !
Kind souls , what , weep you when you but behold Our Caesar's vesture wounded ?
Is that the uttermost ?
Carry this mad knave to the jail. , Father Baptista , I charge you see that he be forthcoming .
Take it and do 't , and leave me for this time .
I will not think it .
Give me your hand .
I pray you , sir , hold your hand .
Foolish wench , To th ' most of men this is a Caliban And they to him are angels .
And for his cowardship , ask Fabian .
God in heaven bless her !
Sit down and feed , and welcome to our table .
Boundless intemperance In nature is a tyranny .
Oh , where is Romeo ?
Yes , I intend so .
Even since you left it .
No , madam , he does nothing but smile .
They that stand high have many blasts to shake them , And if they fall , they dash themselves to pieces .
Hark , they roar .
And so in me , and so , I think , in all .
By this leek , I will most horribly revenge .
Tell him I would speak with him .
Let us deal justly .
Did you send to him , sir ?
Let me live here ever .
Sir , Mark Antony Will e'en but kiss Octavia , and we'll follow .
Crowner's quest law .
How the moon sleeps with Endymion And would not be awaked .
Portia , forgive me this enforced wrong , And in the hearing of these many friends I swear to thee , even by thine own fair eyes Wherein I see myself , Mark you but that !
You always end with a jade's trick .
Say "a day" without the "ever." No , no , Orlando , men are April when they woo , December when they wed. Maids are May when they are maids , but the sky changes when they are wives .
You may go to the devil's dam !
To be Count Malvolio !
Tis from your sister .
The valiant never taste of death but once .
Perform 't , or else we damn thee." How , my love ?
Romeo must not live .
Hold , for shame !
And , good lieutenant , I think you think I love you .
Twas you we laughed at .
Go apart , Adam , and thou shalt hear how he will shake me up .
Or shall we on without apology ?
We will , fair queen , up to the mountain's top , And mark the musical confusion Of hounds and echo in conjunction .
And when she speaks , is it not an alarum to love ?
Think you so ?
Richard yet lives , hell's black intelligencer , Only reserved their factor to buy souls And send them thither .
Tis not yet near day .
I would do much T ' atone them , for the love I bear to Cassio .
At nine i ' th ' morning here we'll meet again .
Not Hermia but Helena I love .
I say , remember .
Sir , will you , with those infirmities she owes , Unfriended , new adopted to our hate , Dowered with our curse and strangered with our oath , Take her or leave her ?
Fare thee well , nymph .
Tis three o'clock , and , Romans , yet ere night We shall try fortune in a second fight .
Behold this man .
And died so ?
Crystal is muddy .
Therefore , my sweet Rose , my dear Rose , be merry .
You have told me she hath received them and returned me expectations and comforts of sudden respect and acquaintance , but I find none .
And my trust , Like a good parent , did beget of him A falsehood in its contrary as great As my trust was , which had indeed no limit , A confidence sans bound .
I will not give my part of this sport for a pension of thousands to be paid from the Sophy .
I'll stay no longer question .
Is he not approved in the height a villain , that hath slandered , scorned , dishonored my kinswoman ?
So , let me hear you speak .
He does .
But I remember now I am in this earthly world , where to do harm Is often laudable , to do good sometime Accounted dangerous folly .
Who else should be ?
Which do not be entreated to , but weigh What it is worth embraced .
By your most gracious pardon , I sing but after you .
I like the work well .
Motley's the only wear .
I will , my lord .
There were none fine but Adam , Rafe , and Gregory .
Come , Kate , we'll to bed .
Then slip I from her bum , down topples she , And "Tailor ! " cries , and falls into a cough , And then the whole quire hold their hips and laugh , And waxen in their mirth , and neeze , and swear A merrier hour was never wasted there .
To this , add defiance , and tell him , for conclusion , he hath betrayed his followers , whose condemnation is pronounced." So far my king and master ; so much my office .
And what said Surrey then ?
Go back again , thou slave , and fetch him home .
Sir , he answered me in the roundest manner he would not .
There's one at the gate .
Hast thou drunk well ?
She creeps .
I fly , Biondello .
In some bush ?
Tis his fashion .
A howling monster , a drunken monster .
I'll claim that promise at your Grace's hands .
Bid them achieve me and then sell my bones .
Where left we last ?
Nothing will come of nothing .
Yes , nightingales answer daws !
Am not I Christopher Sly , old Sly's son of Burton Heath , by birth a peddler , by education a cardmaker , by transmutation a bearherd , and now by present profession a tinker ?
Take him on the costard with the hilts of thy sword , and then throw him into the malmsey butt in the next room .
There's hope in 't yet .
Wherefore was that cry ?
O most courageous day !
Asses are made to bear , and so are you .
Of a certain knight that swore by his honor they were good pancakes , and swore by his honor the mustard was naught .
Therefore thy earliness doth me assure Thou art uproused by some distemperature .
Remember'st thou any that have died on 't ?
Silence awhile. , Robin , take off this head. , Titania , music call , and strike more dead Than common sleep of all these five the sense .
Conceit , more rich in matter than in words , Brags of his substance , not of ornament .
Come on .
I mean , the matter that you read , my lord .
Out o ' th ' moon , I do assure thee .
God be wi ' you , sir .
Here comes the furious Tybalt back again .
Are yet two Romans living such as these ?
How can it be ?
Now you talk of a sheet of paper , I remember a pretty jest your daughter told .
No more , no more .
What , are there masques ?
My good lords both , with all the heed I can .
Therefore your Grace may well say I have lost it .
Peace then !
I say it is the moon that shines so bright .
He came to me , and I delivered it .
Shylock , there's thrice thy money offered thee .
So long ?
But notwithstanding , haste .
Let him be Caesar !
Then , in the name of God and all these rights , Advance your standards .
Where's the king ?
There is your money that I had to keep .
Tybalt is dead , and Romeo banished."
You are almost come to part almost a fray .
Heaven knows what she has known .
No , Caesar hath it not .
Was the crown offered him thrice ?
You'll be sick tomorrow For this night's watching .
On , to the field !
It is but change , Titinius , for Octavius Is overthrown by noble Brutus ' power , As Cassius ' legions are by Antony .
To be now a sensible man , by and by a fool , and presently a beast !
Hers you are .
You men of Cyprus , let her have your knees .
you know me well .
I will do any thing , Nerissa , ere I'll be married to a sponge .
Do you find some occasion to anger Cassio , either by speaking too loud , or tainting his discipline , or from what other course you please , which the time shall more favorably minister .
A greater gift ?
Who will go with me ?
Here , kiss the book .
News from Verona ! , How now , Balthasar ?
Your hand , Leonato .
Ay .
Where is thy luster now ?
Of one not easily jealous , but being wrought , Perplexed in the extreme .
Tempt him not so too far .
I shall find time , Cassius , I shall find time .
Here .
I will possess you of that ship and treasure .
But being widow , and my Gloucester with her , May all the building in my fancy pluck Upon my hateful life .
I'll pheeze you , in faith .
A coward , a most devout coward , religious in it .
Thou 'dst never fear the net nor lime , The pitfall nor the gin .
I'll court his favors .
Do not think it so unwholesome .
This deed of thine is no more worthy heaven Than thou wast worthy her .
Sir , being his knave , I will .
The Jove of power make me most weak , most weak , Your reconciler !
Bid her have good heart .
It is .
I pray you , is my master yet returned ?
But better service have I never done you Than now to bid you hold .
But , my good lord , your Graces ' words shall serve As well as I had seen and heard him speak ; And do not doubt , right noble princes both , But I'll acquaint our duteous citizens With all your just proceedings in this case .
Ask her forgiveness ?
My hair doth stand an end to hear her curses .
Adieu .
tis a lost fear .
I can not drink too much of Brutus ' love .
I have 't .
O lady , speak again !
Never so rich a gem Was set in worse than gold .
We'll go along together , And ere we have thy youthful wages spent , We'll light upon some settled low content .
he whom next thyself Of all the world I loved and to him put The manage of my state , as at that time Through all the signories it was the first , And Prospero the prime duke , being so reputed In dignity , and for the liberal arts Without a parallel .
Stephano !
Your reason ?
To cabin , silence !
By my troth , Sir Toby , you must come in earlier o ' nights .
Both which , Master Constable , You have .
Do so , and bid my sweet prepare to chide .
Have you sent to Bottom's house ?
Caesar and Lepidus have made wars upon Pompey .
I know thy constellation is right apt For this affair .
That's our offer .
What countryman ?
And , being done , thus Wall away doth go .
Oh ho , oh ho !
Now Margaret's curse is fall'n upon our heads , When she exclaimed on Hastings , you , and I , For standing by when Richard stabbed her son .
But yet I can not love him ; He might have took his answer long ago .
Just as high as my heart .
No warmth , no breath shall testify thou livest .
Then , good my lord , teach your cousin to consent winking .
Peace !
Arise , arise , Awake the snorting citizens with the bell Or else the devil will make a grandsire of you .
What's your grace's will ?
Which in his dearest need will fly from him .
This man said , sir , that Don John , the Prince's brother , was a villain .
This speed of Caesar's Carries beyond belief .
She says you have some goodly jest in hand .
Well , 'tis not so , my Lord High Constable .
O God !
I am the second son of old Sir Rowland , That bring these tidings to this fair assembly .
They vanished strangely .
Hot , hot , and moist .
I'll after him , and see the event of this .
Thou told'st me they were stol'n unto this wood .
My strange and self-abuse Is the initiate fear that wants hard use .
You are a spirit , I know .

Do we all holy rites .
Cleopatra , Think you there was or might be such a man As this I dreamt of ?

His very genius hath taken the infection of the device , man .
God and our good cause fight upon our side .
And therefore is winged Cupid painted blind .
He brings great news .
But you are no such man .
Take them in .
Alack , what trouble Was I then to you !
Now is it Rome indeed , and room enough , When there is in it but one only man .
Come on and kiss me , Kate .
I hear his trumpet .
Nym , thou hast spoke the right .
Provoke not battle Till we have done at sea .
To the health of our general !
So , so , so .
Arrest him , officer .
I may sit in a corner and cry , "Heigh-ho for a husband ! " Lady Beatrice , I will get you one .
We will hear Caesar's will .
And so he fell .
Such wind as scatters young men through the world To seek their fortunes farther than at home , Where small experience grows .
I know it is the sun that shines so bright .
Who calls ?
This is a man , old , wrinkled , faded , withered , And not a maiden , as thou say'st he is .
Mark Antony , here , take you Caesar's body .
Who sent you hither ?
Maria once told me she did affect me , and I have heard herself come thus near , that , should she fancy , it should be one of my complexion .
Take thrice thy money .
My dukedom to a beggarly denier , I do mistake my person all this while !
Oh , she is Ten times more gentle than her father's crabbed , And he's composed of harshness .
Tis almost fairy time .
I have known when he would have walked ten mile afoot to see a good armor , and now will he lie ten nights awake carving the fashion of a new doublet .
And I , most jocund , apt , and willingly , To do you rest , a thousand deaths would die .
What ?
Quiet thy cudgel .
Why , at her father's .
Well , I am sorry for your niece .
If love be blind , love can not hit the mark .
Leave you your power to draw , And I shall have no power to follow you .
What man is that ?
If I can recover him and keep him tame and get to Naples with him , he's a present for any emperor that ever trod on neat's leather .
Sweet Phoebe , pity me .
When 's god's asleep , he'll rob his bottle .
Never to speak of this that you have seen .
God for Thy mercy , they are loose again !
Pisa , renowned for grave citizens , Gave me my being and my father first , A merchant of great traffic through the world , Vincentio , come of the Bentivolii .
But though we think it so , it is no matter .
A miracle !
Why do you send so thick ?
Aboard , aboard , for shame !
Let housewifery appear .
If it be not for some purpose of import , Give 't me again .
Bianca's love Made me exchange my state with Tranio , While he did bear my countenance in the town , And happily I have arrived at the last Unto the wished haven of my bliss .
Where dost thou hide thy head ?
Your gentleness shall force More than your force move us to gentleness .
My fool usurps my body .
It is even so .
A thing for me ?
In such a night To shut me out !
I must embrace thee .
Good morrow , neighbor Baptista .
Hillo , ho , ho , boy .
To the Elephant .
We'll hear him. , Noble Antony , go up .
Go , by this token .
So Chrish save me , I will cut off your head .

Send one presently to Sir Toby .
Had I plantation of this isle , my lord , He'd sow 't with nettle seed .
May you stead me ?
I have heard Your grace hath ta'en great pains to qualify His rigorous course .
Oh , most lame and impotent conclusion !
Turn thee back , And tell thy king I do not seek him now But could be willing to march on to Calais Without impeachment , for , to say the sooth , Though 'tis no wisdom to confess so much Unto an enemy of craft and vantage , My people are with sickness much enfeebled , My numbers lessened , and those few I have Almost no better than so many French , Who when they were in health , I tell thee , herald , I thought upon one pair of English legs Did march three Frenchmen .
Be the Jacks fair within , the Jills fair without , the carpets laid , and everything in order ?
Time , thou anticipat'st my dread exploits .

Mass , and well said .
O wonderful , wonderful , and most wonderful wonderful , and yet again wonderful , and after that , out of all whooping !
You shall be soon dispatched with fair conditions .
Then keep thy vow , sirrah , when thou meet'st the fellow .
A foolish thought , to say a sorry sight .
Show me , show me .
Let us die .
Take up those cords. , Poor ropes , you are beguiled , Both you and I , for Romeo is exiled .
Gramercy !
Not in my husband's nose .
My purposes do draw me much about .
Under this conjuration , speak , my lord , For we will hear , note , and believe in heart That what you speak is in your conscience washed As pure as sin with baptism .
Good news , good news !
That "sort" was well fished for .
How now , Cassio !
This dagger hath mista'en , for , lo , his house Is empty on the back of Montague , And it mis-sheathed in my daughter's bosom .
You must say "paragon." A "paramour" is , God bless us , a thing of naught .
Here's no knavery !
That shall she .
We'll leave you , Brutus .

More light and light , more dark and dark our woes !
But this reasoning is not in the fashion to choose me a husband .
Marry , th ' athversary was have possession of the pridge , but he is enforced to retire , and the duke of Exeter is master of the pridge .
God give him joy !
Now , princely Buckingham , seal thou this league With thy embracements to my wife's allies And make me happy in your unity .
So please your majesty That we may wake the king ?
I will not shame myself to give you this .
I will employ thee back again ; I find thee Most fit for business .

I , gentle mistress .
In debating which was best , we shall part with neither .
How ?
How , in stripping it , You more invest it !
O , then by day Where wilt thou find a cavern dark enough To mask thy monstrous visage ?
I have neither the scholar's melancholy , which is emulation ; nor the musician's , which is fantastical ; nor the courtier's , which is proud ; nor the soldier's , which is ambitious ; nor the lawyer's , which is politic ; nor the lady's , which is nice ; nor the lover's , which is all these , but it is a melancholy of mine own , compounded of many simples , extracted from many objects , and indeed the sundry contemplation of my travels , in which my often rumination wraps me in a most humorous sadness .
Therefore , out of my love to you , I came hither to acquaint you withal , that either you might stay him from his intendment or brook such disgrace well as he shall run into , in that it is a thing of his own search and altogether against my will .
You must think this , look you , that the worm will do his kind .
Now , I'll stand to it , the pancakes were naught and the mustard was good , and yet was not the knight forsworn .

Fare thee well .
Father , in .

O murderous slumber , Layst thou thy leaden mace upon my boy That plays thee music ? , Gentle knave , good night .
Since I am crept in favor with myself , I will maintain it with some little cost .
And when shalt thou see him again ?
Some friendship will it lend you 'gainst the tempest .
Now , as thou lovest me , let me see his letter .
Therefore get you on and give him his desire .
Why art thou angry ?
I would kiss before I spoke .
Then how can it be said I am alone When all the world is here to look on me ?
Above my fortunes , yet my state is well .
I pray thee , good Horatio , wait upon him .

I will do so .
Here's drink .
Take them away .
I must eat my dinner .
Why , Belman is as good as he , my lord .
What men have you lost , Fluellen ?

You spoke not with her since ?
Come , throw it o'er my face .
This sword but shown to Caesar , with this tidings , Shall enter me with him .
Go get him surgeons .
I have seen her die twenty times upon far poorer moment .
Fellow , wilt thou bestow thy time with me ?
You sent me to the bay , sir , for a bark .
Was 't not the way ?
What a sigh is there !
It can not be .
It is the lark that sings so out of tune , Straining harsh discords and unpleasing sharps .
But take a taste of my finding him , and relish it with good observance .
Why , uncle , 'tis a shame .

I will , lady .
Come on .
Rarely , rarely .
I am paid for 't now .
O heavens !
Why , I can buy me twenty at any market .
Thou seest we are not all alone unhappy .
I must another way To fetch a ladder , by the which your love Must climb a bird's nest soon when it is dark .
Now fare you well , good sir .
My learned lord , we pray you to proceed And justly and religiously unfold Why the law Salic that they have in France Or should or should not bar us in our claim .
Take him hence .
By your patience , I may not suffer you to visit them .
My servant , sir !
Is it possible A cur can lend three thousand ducats ? " Or Shall I bend low and in a bondman's key With bated breath and whispering humbleness Say this :

Master young man , you , I pray you , which is the way to Master Jew's ?
Now , by my troth , if I had been remembered , I could have given my uncle's grace a flout To touch his growth nearer than he touched mine .

She was too fond of her most filthy bargain .
Never make known what you have seen tonight .
Why , then you must .
Dear my lord , Make me acquainted with your cause of grief .
Too long a pause for that which you find there .
Were such things here as we do speak about ?
I will be near to second your attempt , and he shall fall between us .
Go bear it to the Centaur , where we host , And stay there , Dromio , till I come to thee .
Malcolm !

My lord , we were sent for .
We shall , my liege .
I owe you none till I receive the chain .
And from thy hated presence part I so .
Lights , lights , lights !
What were these ?
If only to go warm were gorgeous , Why , nature needs not what thou gorgeous wear'st , Which scarcely keeps thee warm .
Here , sirrah Grumio .
My name is Edgar , and thy father's son .

Now must the world point at poor Katherine And say , "Lo , there is mad Petruchio's wife , If it would please him come and marry her !

I will , my liege .
O most dear mistress , The sun will set before I shall discharge What I must strive to do .

I thank it .
Even he , madam .

They have their exits and their entrances , And one man in his time plays many parts , His acts being seven ages .
Ay , what else ?
Well , you temporize with the hours .
Ay , madam .
But was not this nigh shore ?
If I were bound to divine of this unity , I would not prophesy so .
Watch me like Argus .
Come , you look paler and paler .
The drink , the drink !
I shall win at the odds .
Do .
Did I not meet thy friends ?
At least I'm sure it may be so in Denmark .
You lie .
The gods make this a happy day to Antony !
Here comes the Countess .
My lady will hang thee for thy absence .
I gave you all , And in good time you gave it .
You can not feed capons so .
I mean , the Lord Protector .
Romeo !
That she was false to wedlock ?
For several virtues Have I liked several women .
Come , we burn daylight , ho !
Nor I .
One draught above heat makes him a fool , the second mads him , and a third drowns him .
Do you not jest ?
You see me , Lord Bassanio , where I stand Such as I am .
Meantime God grants that we have need of you .
A man , sir .
What , is my beaver easier than it was ?

Prithee , away .
With the earl , sir , here within .
What to him from England ?
If thou doubt it , thou mayst slide from my shoulder to my heel with no greater a run but my head and my neck .
If thou dost find him tractable to us , Encourage him and show him all our reasons .
Let it be written in eight and eight .
Does any here know me ?
I remember him well , and I remember him worthy of thy praise .
I know young bloods look for a time of rest .
The duke is humorous .
Why , one that swears and lies .
Wilt thou , Strato ?
Ay , my lord .
Now , Antony , our hopes are answered .
Your loves , as mine to you .
Corinth first .
For Brutus ' sake , I am beholding to you .
It alone concerns your ear .
I never knew woman love man so .
Go , prepare for dinner .
Brother , Content yourself .
What thinkest thou of his opinion ?
For , my good liege , she is so idly kinged , Her scepter so fantastically borne By a vain , giddy , shallow , humorous youth , That fear attends her not .
Return you to my sister .
Here's metal more attractive .
Some men there are love not a gaping pig , Some that are mad if they behold a cat , And others , when the bagpipe sings i ' th ' nose , Can not contain their urine .
By my holy order , I thought thy disposition better tempered .
Speed him hence .
Speak , nephew .
We would be resolved , Before we hear him , of some things of weight That task our thoughts concerning us and France .
Nor in thine , lord .
Come , come , you're drunk .
How canst thou woo her ?
Vex not his ghost .
Therein , ye gods , you make the weak most strong .
He's as good at anything and yet a fool .
But oh , how oddly will it sound that I Must ask my child forgiveness !
Portia , art thou gone ?
Here in these confines slyly have I lurked To watch the waning of mine enemies .
Here , noble lord .
You are an ass , you are an ass !
Then follow me and give me audience , friends .
O , teach me how I should forget to think !
Ay , do you fear it ?
Farewell , kind master .
Come , shall I make you two friends ?
His son is thirty .
Shall , Antipholus , Even in the spring of love thy love-springs rot ?
Stanley , he is your wife's son .
We shall further think on 't .
Why , thou say'st true .
Tis now struck twelve .
How many then should cover that stand bare !
The ladies , her attendants of her chamber Saw her abed , and in the morning early They found the bed untreasured of their mistress .
I will not choose what many men desire Because I will not jump with common spirits And rank me with the barbarous multitudes .
I will depart in quiet And , in despite of mirth , mean to be merry .
Refuse it not .
I'll put myself in poor and mean attire And with a kind of umber smirch my face .
What is the matter ?
I call them forth to credit her .
The day will come that thou shalt wish for me To help thee curse that poisonous bunch-backed toad .
They must be bound and laid in some dark room .
Hark ye , your Romeo will be here at night .
How foolish do your fears seem now , Calphurnia !
I will praise any man that will praise me , though it can not be denied what I have done by land .
What is her mother ?
But , for certain , He can not buckle his distempered cause Within the belt of rule .
Bleed , bleed , poor country !
Repose you there , while I to this hard house , More harder than the stones whereof 'tis raised , Which even but now , demanding after you , Denied me to come in , return , and force Their scanted courtesy .
Therefore the winds , piping to us in vain , As in revenge , have sucked up from the sea Contagious fogs , which falling in the land Have every pelting river made so proud That they have overborne their continents .
Orsino , noble sir , Be pleased that I shake off these names you give me .
O woeful time .
I ' faith , sir , you shall never need to fear .
And he's gone .
Lord of his fortunes he salutes thee , and Requires to live in Egypt ; which not granted , He lessens his requests , and to thee sues To let him breathe between the heavens and earth A private man in Athens .
Why , the hot-blooded France that dowerless took Our youngest born , I could as well be brought To knee his throne , and , squirelike , pension beg To keep base life afoot .
Friends , come hither .
And maidens call it "love-in-idleness." Fetch me that flower .
So says the Prince and my new-trothed lord .
What , shall I groan and tell thee ?
I beseech you , follow straight .
I'll set her on .
Oh , thou art deceived .
Husband , let's follow to see the end of this ado .
Run after that same peevish messenger , The county's man .
Welcome hither .
Sir , I am vexed .
He has brave utensils , for so he calls them , Which when he has a house , he'll deck withal .
I remember the story .
And but my noble Moor Is true of mind and made of no such baseness As jealous creatures are , it were enough To put him to ill thinking .
There remain And fortify it strongly 'gainst the French .
By Jeshu , I am your Majesty's countryman , I care not who know it .
Art thou good at these kickshawses , knight ?
Tis a good dullness , And give it way .
And since the quarrel Will bear no color for the thing he is , Fashion it thus : that what he is , augmented , Would run to these and these extremities .
Why , this it is when men are ruled by women .
Tomorrow then I will expect your coming .
Tom's a- cold .
Gentleman , God save thee .
How's that ?
Be thou familiar but by no means vulgar .
I am the greatest , able to do least , Yet most suspected , as the time and place Doth make against me , of this direful murder .
But that thy strange mutations make us hate thee , Life would not yield to age .
Sola !
Fled this way , sir , when by no means he could , Pursue him , ho !
Is it so nominated in the bond ?
What a plague means my niece , to take the death of her brother thus ?
Now , my co-mates and brothers in exile , Hath not old custom made this life more sweet Than that of painted pomp ?
Did I not tell you she was innocent ?
The ox hath therefore stretched his yoke in vain , The ploughman lost his sweat , and the green corn Hath rotted ere his youth attained a beard .
You thought because he could not speak English in the native garb , he could not therefore handle an English cudgel .
Let the great gods That keep this dreadful pudder o'er our heads Find out their enemies now .
You , Roderigo !
FOOL Oh , he's drunk , Sir Toby , an hour agone .
Oh , that brave Caesar !
I am pale , Charmian .
Tell me in sadness , who is that you love .
Enough .
Good morrow , neighbor , whither away so fast ?
Sola , sola !
Then , if ever thou dar'st acknowledge it , I will make it my quarrel .
Good morrow to thee .
So well thy words become thee as thy wounds ; They smack of honor both .
He that stirs next to carve for his own rage Holds his soul light , he dies upon his motion .
And badest me bury love .
Ay , marry , is 't .
Go , some of you , And bring these gentlemen where Hamlet is .
Cousin , thou wast not wont to be so dull .
Not for thy fairy kingdom. , Fairies , away !
And I do believe your Majesty takes no scorn to wear the leek upon Saint Tavy's day .
Too late , good Diomed .
Let him be the devil , an he will , I care not .
So I , to find a mother and a brother , In quest of them , unhappy , lose myself .
O , give me leave .
My lord .
Do this expediently , and turn him going .
But tell not me .
Dead .
Here , my good lord .
Away !
Wilt come ?
Romeo ! , Alack , alack , what blood is this , which stains The stony entrance of the sepulcher ?
Ay , my lord .
Doth not Ay , Nurse , what of that ?
Let me have surgeons .
Why , what's the matter ?
By Hercules , I think I am i' th' right .
Not to his father's .
Think so , Iago ?
A dear happiness to women .
Give you good night .
Tranio , I saw her coral lips to move And with her breath she did perfume the air .
For with throwing thus my head , Dogs leap the hatch , and all are fled .
You shall hear more by midnight .
Sure , I think so , And therefore certainly it were not good She knew his love , lest she make sport at it .
Good sir , I do in friendship counsel you To leave this place .
Titinius ' face is upward .
Age , thou art shamed !
If thou beest Trinculo , come forth .
Come hither , gentlemen , And lay your hands again upon my sword .
And ask no other dowry with her but such another jest .
Who ?
Why , we have galls , and though we have some grace , Yet have we some revenge .
All that follow their noses are led by their eyes but blind men , and there's not a nose among twenty but can smell him that's stinking .
And I have reason for it .
Scape being drunk for want of wine .
What , did they never whisper ?
How !
Come , sire , no more. , What , Oswald , ho !
Who chooseth me shall have as much as he deserves" !
You know not what you do .
Send out more horses .
What ho , Horatio !
My life upon 't , young though thou art , thine eye Hath stay'd upon some favor that it loves .
I pray you , see him presently discharged , For he is bound to sea , and stays but for it .
Tyrrel , I mean those bastards in the Tower .
Messala , This is my birthday , as this very day Was Cassius born .
What , all my pretty chickens and their dam At one fell swoop ?
Our son shall win .
That thing you speak of , I took it for a man .
The storm is up and all is on the hazard .
Rub him about the temples .
Where is my lord of Gloucester ?
How I dote on thee !
What is your name ?
What a caterwauling do you keep here !
Tell me , thou villain-slave , where are my children ?
Why , she comes to borrow nothing of them .
Give me audience , good madam .
But , soft !
Welcome , dear madam .
Well , old man , I will tell you news of your son .
At least two glasses .
If sight and shape be true , Why then , my love adieu .
No , thy words are too precious to be cast away upon curs .
That's more than we know .
A grievous fault. , Say , woman , didst thou so ?
Dispatch us with all speed , lest that our king Come here himself to question our delay , For he is footed in this land already .
My duty to you both , on equal love , Great kings of France and England .
An 'twere to me , I should be mad at it .
But are you so much in love as your rhymes speak ?
I will hide me in the arbor .
I am so .
I'll take my leave .
Why , if two gods should play some heavenly match And on the wager lay two earthly women , And Portia one , there must be something else Pawned with the other , for the poor rude world Hath not her fellow .
I tell thee , Litio , this is wonderful !
So please your grace , the Prologue is addressed .
Reserve them till a merrier hour than this .
Or like a whale .
Ay , sir .
But that they call "compliment" is like th ' encounter of two dog- apes .
Well met , well met , Master Antipholus .
Cry "holla" to thy tongue , I prithee .
The wine of life is drawn , and the mere lees Is left this vault to brag of .
I found him here as melancholy as a lodge in a warren .
Tis well blown , lads .
I set him there , sir , but his own disorders Deserved much less advancement .
Take thy fair hour , Laertes .
Had not that been as proper ?
What , are you mad ?
I pray you , what thinks he of our estate ?
And now I'll do 't .
And to sink in it , should you burthen love , Too great oppression for a tender thing .
See , see , our honored hostess !
Let some of my people have a special care of him .
Is this the king we sent to for his ransom ?
You hear him all night .
Haply the seas and countries different With variable objects shall expel This something-settled matter in his heart , Whereon his brains still beating puts him thus From fashion of himself .
You rise to play and go to bed to work .
Of us must Pompey presently be sought , Or else he seeks out us .
Scout me for him at the corner the orchard like a bum-baily .
The fault , dear Brutus , is not in our stars But in ourselves , that we are underlings .
Villain , thou didst deny the gold's receipt And told'st me of a mistress and a dinner , For which , I hope , thou felt'st I was displeased .
Pray you , let's sit together .
Demetrius loves her , and he loves not you .
Come , your answer in broken music , for thy voice is music and thy English broken .
No , Antony , take the lot .
Put up thy sword , Or manage it to part these men with me .
Sweetly in force unto her fair life's end .
Once more , Cesario , Get thee to yond same sovereign cruelty .
Bring her to try wi ' th ' main course .
Who doth he gallop withal ?
Our bodies are our gardens , to the which our wills are gardeners .
One of these three contains her heavenly picture .
Ho , open the door .
It was ourself thou didst abuse .
But died thy sister of her love , my boy ?
Now he'll outstare the lightning .
Give me particulars .
Good Lord !
Forgot you !
O time's extremity , Hast thou so crack'd and splitted my poor tongue In seven short years that here my only son Knows not my feeble key of untuned cares ?
So smooth he daubed his vice with show of virtue That , his apparent open guilt omitted , I mean his conversation with Shore's wife , He lived from all attainder of suspects .
I will follow .
I'll make her come , I warrant you , presently .
How now , Lord Stanley , what's the news ?
Stay , I prithee , tell me what thou thinkest of me .
There are more things in heaven and earth , Horatio , Than are dreamt of in your philosophy .
There are the players .
In sadness , cousin , I do love a woman .
Show me briefly how .
So that , as clear as is the summer's sun , King Pepin's title and Hugh Capet's claim , King Lewis his satisfaction , all appear To hold in right and title of the female .
Let them affright thee .
Briefly , sir .
My lord .
My spirits , as in a dream , are all bound up .
Moonshine and Lion are left to bury the dead .
Oh , wretched villain !
Look , in this place ran Cassius ' dagger through .
Who can control his fate ?
Put your torches out .
I hope so .
I speak not as in absolute fear of you .
You touched my vein at first .
Here love , thou seest how diligent I am , To dress thy meat myself and bring it thee .
Cassio , my lord ?
Good morrow , worthy Caesar .
I know his eye doth homage otherwhere , Or else what lets it but he would be here ?
He never did harm that I heard of .
Pass .
Caesar , thou art revenged , Even with the sword that killed thee .
Swallows have built In Cleopatra's sails their nests .
First resolve me that .
Safe , Antony .
Seyton ! , I am sick at heart , When I behold , Seyton , I say ! , This push Will cheer me ever , or disseat me now .
Now , my lord .
My lord , I'll tell you that self bill is urged Which in th ' eleventh year of the last king's reign Was like , and had indeed against us passed But that the scambling and unquiet time Did push it out of farther question .
Sir , he may live .
Go with me .
What is "t o"clock ?
Good majesty , Herod of Jewry dare not look upon you But when you are well pleased .
Nay , he reserved a blanket , else we had been all shamed .
Pray you , tell him I am his fortune's vassal , and I send him The greatness he has got .
Here is better than the open air .
Signior Baptista , you are happily met. , Sir , this is the gentleman I told you of .
Contemning Rome , he has done all this and more In Alexandria .
Call in the messengers .
Why , there , there , there , there !
We have done our course .
The king is not bound to answer the particular endings of his soldiers , the father of his son , nor the master of his servant , for they purpose not their death , when they purpose their services .
You knew my father well , and in him me , Left solely heir to all his lands and goods , Which I have bettered rather than decreased .
If thou wilt needs damn thyself , do it a more delicate way than drowning .
Tis well thou art not fish .
Shall I have some water ? , Come , Kate , and wash , and welcome heartily. , You whoreson villain !
Rescue , fair lord , or else the day is lost !
Do you question me as an honest man should do , for my simple true judgment ?
I think he brings the money .
Who ?
If your love do not persuade you to come , let not my letter." O love , dispatch all business and be gone !
Have patience , madam .
Bid that welcome Which comes to punish us , and we punish it , Seeming to bear it lightly .
Faith , I saw it not , but I felt it hot in her breath .
By no means" what ?
I am the duke That loved your father .
The rest will comfort , for thy counsel's sound .
What say you , uncle ?
A plague o ' both your houses !
Wast thou mad , That thus so madly thou didst answer me ?
Though news be sad , yet tell them merrily .
Romeo can , Though heaven can not .
Methoughts that I had broken from the Tower And was embarked to cross to Burgundy , And in my company my brother Gloucester , Who from my cabin tempted me to walk Upon the hatches .
Why do you make such faces ?
Caesar , my lord .
I know him ; he wears a lock .
No , but to the gate , and there will the devil meet me like an old cuckold with horns on his head , and say , "Get you to heaven , Beatrice , get you to heaven ; here's no place for you maids." So deliver I up my apes and away to Saint Peter .
Tis done by me , and ends in "Margaret." Thus have you breathed your curse against yourself .
O heavenly mingle !
Who knows if Donalbain be with his brother ?
Strangle her in her bed , even the bed she hath contaminated .
I am a gentleman , sir , and my name is Conrade .
I shall , my lord .
But since he is better we have therefore odds .
Brother , I advise you to the best .
This shall end without the perdition of souls .
Remember First to possess his books , for without them He's but a sot , as I am , nor hath not One spirit to command .
So get you hence in peace .
Who is 't that calls ?
Appear thou in the likeness of a sigh !
God give your Grace good rest .
There is too great testimony in your complexion that it was a passion of earnest .
Their bloody sign of battle is hung out , And something to be done immediately .
Out , tawny Tartar , out !
Let's have the tongs and the bones .
Give me your arm .
Get thee hence .
Arm , arm , my lord .
But for your words , they rob the Hybla bees And leave them honeyless .
O God , your only jig-maker .
Pah !
By this hand , Claudio shall render me a dear account .
Beggar that I am , I am even poor in thanks ; but I thank you , and sure , dear friends , my thanks are too dear a halfpenny .
I beseech thee , youth , Put not another sin upon my head By urging me to fury .
Mark it , nuncle .
Fie , Fie , lieutenant , You'll be ashamed for ever .
Is 't not the king ?
A little water clears us of this deed .
Well , if you were but an inch of fortune better than I , where would you choose it ?
When didst thou sleep when such a deed was done ?
My dear lord , You know the fiery quality of the duke , How unremoveable and fixed he is In his own course .
But how long fairly shall her sweet life last ?
But what of Cicero ?
What is 't o'clock ?
And I do think she's thirty .
Is it concluded that he shall be Protector ?
Go to , go to .
Either there is a civil strife in heaven , Or else the world , too saucy with the gods , Incenses them to send destruction .
And so am I revenged. , That would be scanned .
Get me some poison , Iago , this night .
Good night , good doctor .
Upon my power I may dismiss this court , Unless Bellario , a learned doctor , Whom I have sent for to determine this , Come here today .
Come , sweet Audrey .
Alas , thou hast misconstrued everything !
So white , and such a traitor ?
Naught that I am , Not for their own demerits , but for mine , Fell slaughter on their souls .
Yet I should kill thee with much cherishing .
Therefore speak softly .
My lord , I have news to tell you .
Octavius , lead your battle softly on , Upon the left hand of the even field .
If thou read this , O Caesar , thou mayst live .
Methinks you are too much of late i ' th ' frown .
Parting is such sweet sorrow That I shall say good night till it be morrow .
The princes both make high account of you , I know they do , and I have well deserved it .
There's rosemary , that's for remembrance .
He has a little galled me , I confess .
I'll bring my wood home faster .

I should be wise , for honesty's a fool And loses that it works for .
All this" ?
If it be found so , some will dear abide it .
A hit , a very palpable hit .
Do , good William .
Tut , tut , thou art all ice ; thy kindness freezes .
No more words .
He says he'll come .
Ay , it stands so that I may hardly tarry so long .
I pray you , know me when we meet again .
Who am I , sir ?
Mark me .
Not a drop before .
Pray thee , go seek him , and bring him to my tent .
No .
Or shall I say her uncle ?
Till then , think of the world .
Sword" is an oath , and oaths must have their course .
My most dear Gloucester !
Let not the heavens hear these telltale women Rail on the Lord's anointed .
I go .
And though she be but little , she is fierce .
Here the street is narrow .
Amen , say we .
I would not for the world they saw thee here .
Good night , good night !
Who's there ?
A spirit , a spirit .
Go seek the traitor Gloucester .
Bear it coldly but till midnight and let the issue show itself .
The door is open , sir .
Brother , ho !
Lord , what though ?
Say on , my loving lord .
Thus I'll visit her .
Seek thine own ease .
Had you not come upon your cue , my lord , William Lord Hastings had pronounced your part , I mean your voice for crowning of the king .
Here , here , sir !
Stand still .
Hark .
That's a fault that water will mend .
Decius , go tell them Caesar will not come .
Her husband , knave .
I thank you , sir .
Dost thou say so ?
My wit's diseased .
What was he , sad or merry ?
Your brother the Bastard is fled from Messina .
Was 't you he rescued ?
But soft !
So much for praising myself , who , I myself will bear witness , is praiseworthy .
Why is this reasoned ?
But what see I ?
By your patience , I needs must rest me .
I pray you , jest , sir , as you sit at dinner .
Remember that you call on me today .
Yes , my conscience , He did us great good .
The business she hath broached in the state Can not endure my absence .
What trade , thou knave ?
I prithee , shepherd , if that love or gold Can in this desert place buy entertainment , Bring us where we may rest ourselves and feed .
Trust not to rotten planks .
I do remember well where I should be , And there I am .
Let him come , and kindly .
Wherefore ?
With Cassio , mistress .
Tide life , tide death , I come without delay .
This falls out better than I could devise .
Mustardseed .
When did I see thee so put down ?
I will go seek the king .
How now , spirit ?
For half thy wealth , it is Antonio's .
So foolish sorrows bids your stones farewell .
But one , poor one , one poor and loving child , But one thing to rejoice and solace in , And cruel death hath catched it from my sight !
What's else to say ? , These quicksands , Lepidus , Keep off them , for you sink .
They steal hearts .
Is not this well ?
These are gracious drops .
Good gentlemen , look fresh and merrily .
Believe me , sir , they butt together well .
Is he not honest ?
I never hated thee .
For shame , bring Juliet forth .
They are .
Good my lord , enter .
I would have her learn , my fair cousin , how perfectly I love her , and that is good English .
Robin Starveling , you must play Thisbe's mother. , Tom Snout , the tinker ?
Shed thou no blood , nor cut thou less nor more But just a pound of flesh .
I say gudday , Captain Fluellen .
This for him .
Who must hang them ?
More company !
Methinks I do .
He is knight , dubbed with unhatched rapier and on carpet consideration , but he is a devil in private brawl .
Tell me , thou villain , where is my son Lucentio ?
They could not , would not do 't .
Let pride , which she calls plainness , marry her .
We have lost your son , I fear , forever .
Whither away ?
Let me see .
Hark !
Who can blot that name With any just reproach ?
My sweet mistress Weeps when she sees me work , and says such baseness Had never like executor .
Or wilt thou hunt ?
Now , Eros .
You shall have some part of your will .
It is so .
Go call him hither .
Truly , sir , the better for my foes and the worse for my friends .
I thank you , sir .
Will it not be received , When we have marked with blood those sleepy two Of his own chamber and used their very daggers , That they have done 't ?
And you by land .
No , but the barber's man hath been seen with him , and the old ornament of his cheek hath already stuffed tennis balls .
What , not one hit ?
As long as hell and Richard likes of it .
Juliet ! , Fast , I warrant her , she. , Why , lamb !
An inviting eye , and yet methinks right modest .
What's your will ?
She turned to folly , and she was a whore .
I wish it might , for now I am your fool .
His life was gentle , and the elements So mixed in him that Nature might stand up And say to all the world , "This was a man." According to his virtue let us use him , With all respect and rites of burial .
My remedy is then to pluck it out .
After so long grief , such nativity !
Me , uncle ?
Woo't weep ?
And let his knights have colder looks among you .
You may as well go about to turn the sun to ice with fanning in his face with a peacock's feather .
Here , my lord .
Where is he ?
Didst thou not fall out with a tailor for wearing his new doublet before Easter ?
Is not tomorrow , boy , the ides of March ?
Make no noise , make no noise .
Sir , in my heart there was a kind of fighting That would not let me sleep .
Oh , now , who will behold The royal captain of this ruined band
As thick as tale Can post with post , and every one did bear Thy praises in his kingdom's great defense , And poured them down before him .
In brief , Sorrow would be a rarity most beloved If all could so become it .
Now must your conscience my acquaintance seal , And you must put me in your heart for friend , Sith you have heard , and with a knowing ear , That he which hath your noble father slain Pursued my life .
Caesar's better parts Shall be crowned in Brutus !
Good Romeo , hide thyself .
But , sir , I will deliver his challenge by word of mouth , set upon Aguecheek a notable report of valor , and drive the gentleman ( as I know his youth will aptly receive it ) into a most hideous opinion of his rage , skill , fury , and impetuosity .
Are you there , wife ?
Have at thee , coward !
My mind hath been as big as one of yours , My heart as great , my reason haply more , To bandy word for word and frown for frown .
There is some ill a-brewing towards my rest , For I did dream of money bags tonight .
No more light answers .
Here comes the Prince and Claudio .
How much more elder art thou than thy looks !
Fine , i ' faith !
How then , sick ?
Twas on a summer's evening in his tent , That day he overcame the Nervii .
Heaven me such uses send , Not to pick bad from bad , but by bad mend !
O Setebos , these be brave spirits indeed !
Hath he set bounds between their love and me ?
Your power and your command is taken off And Cassio rules in Cyprus .
His royal grace , Whom God preserve better than you would wish , Can not be quiet scarce a breathing while But you must trouble him with lewd complaints .
Caius Ligarius doth bear Caesar hard , Who rated him for speaking well of Pompey .
I pray you sir , go forth And give us truth who 'tis that is arrived .
As long as heaven and nature lengthens it .
In him your comfort lives .
Oh , God defend me !
Good morrow , good Lieutenant .
Now , by heaven , My blood begins my safer guides to rule , And passion , having my best judgment collied , Assays to lead the way .
Men may sleep , and they may have their throats about them at that time , and some say knives have edges .
They say he parted well and paid his score .
What malice was between you ?
If Hamlet give the first or second hit Or quit in answer of the third exchange , Let all the battlements their ordnance fire !
Where , where ?
Let your wedding be tomorrow .
In the wars .
Go to .
I do know him by his gait .
Discuss unto me : art thou officer or art thou base , common , and popular ?
Yet here's a spot .
Whilst he stood up and spoke , He was my master , and I wore my life To spend upon his haters .
Farewell .
When we our betters see bearing our woes , We scarcely think our miseries our foes .
It is not for your health thus to commit Your weak condition to the raw , cold morning .
Can you not conceive ?
He shall not go to prison .
He is not very tall , yet for his years he's tall .
What is the matter here ?
I will not hurt him .
Thus have you heard me severed from my bliss ; That by misfortunes was my life prolonged To tell sad stories of my own mishaps .
Now , ere the sun advance his burning eye , The day to cheer and night's dank dew to dry , I must upfill this osier cage of ours With baleful weeds and precious-juiced flowers .
Out , loathed medicine !
There's something else to do .
Good , speak to th ' mariners .
I only speak right on .
My sister may receive it much more worse To have her gentleman abused , assaulted For following her affairs. , Put in his legs .
He knows not the stop .
He is a god and knows What is most right .
Let it be a quarrel between us , if you live .
How oft tonight Have my old feet stumbled at graves ! , Who's there ?
I know the hand .
I am their mother .
Wilt thou be pleased to hearken once again to the suit I made to thee ?
Even he .
Ay , my lord , this same .
Who chooseth me shall get as much as he deserves." I will assume desert. , Give me a key for this , And instantly unlock my fortunes here .
I am sure you are not Launcelot , my boy .

Go make thee ready ; Our letters are prepared .
Mistress , we have .
Nothing in his life Became him like the leaving it .
If you do fight against your country's foes , Your country's fat shall pay your pains the hire .
Then there's life in 't .
They smile at me that shortly shall be dead .

I never saw her till this time .
Follow him , friends .
What should this mean ?
Well , sir , get you in .
Go , girl .
I would my daughter were dead at my foot and the jewels in her ear !
Urchins Shall , forth at vast of night that they may work , All exercise on thee .
If so , be patient , sister .
He did , from first to last .
Shall I do that which all the Parthian darts , Though enemy , lost aim and could not ?
O conspiracy , Shamest thou to show thy dangerous brow by night When evils are most free ?

Whereat grieved , That so his sickness , age , and impotence Was falsely borne in hand , sends out arrests On Fortinbras , which he , in brief , obeys , Receives rebuke from Norway , and in fine Makes vow before his uncle never more To give th ' assay of arms against your majesty .
Incapable and shallow innocents , You can not guess who caused your father's death .
It becomes The throned monarch better than his crown .
I'll wait upon your Lordship .
I'll to my book , For yet ere supper-time must I perform Much business appertaining .
Could my good brother suffer you to do it , A man , a prince by him so benefited ?
Must I bite ?
Long live the king !
Ready .
The cowslips tall her pensioners be .
Had we fought , I doubt we should have been too young for them .
Indeed , sweet love , I was coming to your house .
For the which , as I told you , Antonio shall be bound .
My arm is sore .

Let me ask you one word in private .
Nay then , I'll run .
This business is well ended .
No , not a denier .
Oh , that we now had here But one ten thousand of those men in England That do no work today .
Here , sir !
There is no way but this , Sir Andrew .
But not , as I am , royal .
Pray , do not mock me .
There is no harm intended to your person , Nor to no Roman else .
But there where I have garnered up my heart , Where either I must live or bear no life , The fountain from the which my current runs Or else dries up , to be discarded thence !
Is it new and old too ?
And leave us , Publius , lest that the people , Rushing on us , should do your age some mischief .
Is there any way to show such friendship ?
O Pyramus , arise !
On what compulsion must I ?
Fear it , my dear sister , And keep you in the rear of your affection , Out of the shot and danger of desire .
Promise me life , and I'll confess the truth .
And look you get a prayer book in your hand And stand between two churchmen , good my lord , For on that ground I'll make a holy descant .
That shows thou art unconfirmed .
I thank you , gentle uncle .
Nay , I shall ne'er be ware of mine own wit till I break my shins against it .
How now , my pretty knave ?
The note lies in 's throat , if he say I said so .
God mark thee to his grace !
I frown upon him , yet he loves me still .
No , lady .
Are these , I pray you , wind instruments ?
O woe !
Threescore and ten I can remember well , Within the volume of which time I have seen Hours dreadful and things strange , but this sore night Hath trifled former knowings .
God give me joy to wear it , for my heart is exceeding heavy .
The Lady Beatrice hath a quarrel to you .
Why , what a monstrous fellow art thou , thus to rail on one that is neither known of thee nor knows thee !
What sights , my lord ?
Fortune forbid my outside have not charmed her !

Then tell me , what makes he upon the seas ?
Let her be round with him , And I'll be placed , so please you , in the ear Of all their conference .
Of all the days i ' the year , I came to 't that day that our last King Hamlet overcame Fortinbras .

For these fellows of infinite tongue , that can rhyme themselves into ladies ' favors , they do always reason themselves out again .
Who could be out , being before his beloved mistress ?
Those that are in extremity of either are abominable fellows and betray themselves to every modern censure worse than drunkards .
Pray , set it down and rest you .
Go bring the rabble , O'er whom I give thee power , here to this place .
How long hath she been thus ?
Dead .
Come to me , Tyrrel , soon at after-supper , When thou shalt tell the process of their death .
Sir , I can not .
Say , is your tardy master now at hand ?
My talk to thee must be how Benedick Is sick in love with Beatrice .
And will you , being a man of your breeding , be married under a bush like a beggar ?
How !
Lie thou there .
Well , we were born to die .
Saddle my horses .
Abominable villain !
It is a most sharp sauce .
Offended us you have not , but the king .

If this be so , why blame you me to love you ?
Question enrages him .

Let th' Egyptians And the Phoenicians go a-ducking .

Give me that boy and I will go with thee .
I humbly thank you .
What's your pleasure , sir ?
Who calls ?

And so of men .
What news ?
Here's the place .
Yes , it is apparel .
But one cup .
Tell us the manner of it , gentle Casca .

Assuredly the thing is to be sold .
Gentlemen , forward to the bridal dinner .
Though Cassio did some little wrong to him , As men in rage strike those that wish them best , Yet surely Cassio , I believe , received From him that fled some strange indignity Which patience could not pass .
Now sit we close about this taper here And call in question our necessities .
I by bargain should Wear it myself .
Faith , her privates we .
He did receive his letters and is coming .
I go , my lord .
My Lord Bassanio , let him have the ring .
Ha !
Kind gentlemen , let's go see poor Cassio dressed. , Come , mistress , you must tell 's another tale .
I have already .
The next Caesarion smite , Till by degrees the memory of my womb , Together with my brave Egyptians all , By the discandying of this pelleted storm Lie graveless till the flies and gnats of Nile Have buried them for prey !
Over hill , over dale , Thorough bush , thorough brier , Over park , over pale , Thorough flood , thorough fire .
He's worth no more .
For the love of God , your help !
Her hair , what color ?
My lord , in Athens .
Peace !
Now , afore God , I am so vexed that every part about me quivers .
Alas the day , it did .
Thee and thy virtues here I seize upon , Be it lawful I take up what's cast away .
All-seeing heaven , what a world is this !
Throw physic to the dogs ; I'll none of it .
For it is a figure in rhetoric that drink , being poured out of a cup into a glass , by filling the one doth empty the other .
Where they most breed and haunt , I have observed , The air is delicate .
Nor I neither , by this heavenly light .
Thou canst not .
Would I could answer This comfort with the like .
An oath of mickle might , and fury shall abate .
Well .
Well , well , well .
Charles , I thank thee for thy love to me , which thou shalt find I will most kindly requite .
To him in thine own voice , and bring me word how thou findest him .
I will here shroud till the dregs of the storm be past .
Think yourself a baby That you have ta'en these tenders for true pay , Which are not sterling .
O my son , my son !
God's peace , I would not lose so great an honor As one man more , methinks , would share from me , For the best hope I have .
I do not think 't .
Who's there ?
Come , bring me unto my chance .
There was a noise , That's verily .
Mistress , both man and master is possessed .
The British powers are marching hitherward .
You have lost no reputation at all unless you repute yourself such a loser .
Look , here comes the duke .
What is 't ?
So you may put a man in your belly .
True .
She give it Cassio ?
I have very poor and unhappy brains for drinking .
Farewell , great chief .
And so , without more circumstance at all , I hold it fit that we shake hands and part .
Stand from the body .
Oh !
Here lie I down and measure out my grave .
You shall not stir out of your house today .
My nyas ?
O heaven , O earth , bear witness to this sound And crown what I profess with kind event
Will you walk in to see their gossiping ?
Oh , I have heard him speak of that same brother , And he did render him the most unnatural That lived amongst men .
Bring the villain forth .
There is some strange thing toward , Edmund .
I love you with so much of my heart that none is left to protest .
Stephano is my name , and I bring word My mistress will before the break of day Be here at Belmont .
Ay me , what news ?
Nay , get thee gone .
And how was that ta'en up ?
Oh , so light a foot Will ne'er wear out the everlasting flint .
Since my young lady's going into France , sir , the fool hath much pined away .
My liege , your highness now may do me good .
This broken joint between you and her husband entreat her to splinter , and , my fortunes against any lay worth naming , this crack of your love shall grow stronger than it was before .
My lord , I take my leave .
Methinks I have a great desire to a bottle of hay .
Are you not a strumpet ?
Look how he laughs already !
No doubt the murd'rous knife was dull and blunt Till it was whetted on thy stone-hard heart , To revel in the entrails of my lambs .
I prithee , tell me who is it quickly , and speak apace .
The Prince and Monsieur Love !
And second father This lady makes him to me .
Tis but a man gone .
Tis so , but Edward lives .
Come , I'll dispose of thee Among a sisterhood of holy nuns .
The Prince will doom thee death If thou art taken .
Le Roy ?
My father Is hard at study .
A hundred then .
Why are you grown so rude ?
You have astonished him .
Is thy master coming ?
You saw they speak us fair , give us gold .
Run to the Capulets .
And therefore is he idle ?
The princess is the better Englishwoman. , I ' faith , Kate , my wooing is fit for thy understanding .
Thy lover , Artemidorus" Here will I stand till Caesar pass along , And as a suitor will I give him this .
Hast any philosophy in thee , shepherd ?
Which way hast thou been ?
To lend me arms and aid when I required them , The which you both denied .
Neglected , rather , And then when poisoned hours had bound me up From mine own knowledge .
No more of that .
Let me be ta'en .
Dead art thou !
A grandam's name is little less in love Than is the doting title of a mother .
So was I when your Highness banished him .
Good morrow to this fair assembly .
What it is , my Caius , I shall unfold to thee as we are going To whom it must be done .
The best ?
Tybalt's death Was woe enough , if it had ended there .
Now we speak upon our cue , and our voice is imperial .
Hear me , Queen : The strong necessity of time commands Our services awhile , but my full heart Remains in use with you .
Then thou art damned .
Witless else her son .
Your brother is but young and tender , and , for your love I would be loath to foil him , as I must for my own honor if he come in .
The table's full .
Some to Decius ' house and some to Casca's .
Made it for me , sir ?
Indeed , I am no mourner for that news , Because they have been still my adversaries .
Your lord does know my mind .
What harmony is this ?
Thou didst promise To bate me a full year .
That's a perilous shot out of an elder gun , that a poor and private displeasure can do against a monarch .
Pompey is strong at sea , And it appears he is beloved of those That only have feared Caesar .
It faded on the crowing of the cock .
Sweet marjoram .
A truant disposition , good my lord .
I think we do know the sweet Roman hand .
Here he comes , and the Scots captain , Captain Jamy , with him .
You pay him then .
Well , well , away .
What , ho !
She is not well .
What , not a word ?
I will withdraw To furnish me with some swift means of death For the fair devil .
Is 't lost ?
O , she that might have intercepted thee , By strangling thee in her accursed womb , From all the slaughters , wretch , that thou hast done .
He hath left them you And to your heirs forever , common pleasures , To walk abroad and recreate yourselves .
But what , is Catesby gone ?
And so fare thee well .
I do entreat you , not a man depart , Save I alone , till Antony have spoke .
Most shallow man .
Good Enobarbus !
Let me see the caper .
Are you answered ?
I see , sir , you are liberal in offers .
I do lack some part Of that quick spirit that is in Antony .
Nerissa teaches me what to believe .
What fool is this ?
What hast thou been ?
O God's lady dear , Are you so hot ?
Tyranny is dead !
This sight of death is as a bell , That warns my old age to a sepulcher .
Follow me and receive 't .
Oh , let their bodies follow , my dear liege , With blood and sword and fire to win your right , In aid whereof we of the spiritualty Will raise your Highness such a mighty sum As never did the clergy at one time Bring in to any of your ancestors .
But if that I am I , then well I know Your weeping sister is no wife of mine , Nor to her bed no homage do I owe .
Great Dunsinane he strongly fortifies .
Therefore be o ' good cheer , for truly I think you are damned .
I would it might prove the end of his losses .
Natures of such deep trust we shall much need .
I mean , in a sort .
Madam , he's well .
Look , he stirs .
No , you shall paint when you are old .
And to that place the sharp Athenian law Can not pursue us .
Go to , then !
Sir , you say well , and well you do conceive .
But , as I said , On Lammas Eve at night shall she be fourteen .
And fair words to them .
Who's there ?
Cassio , my lord , hath killed a young Venetian Called Roderigo .
They do me wrong , and I will not endure it !
I can tell you it will serve you to mend your shoes .
I was provoked by her sland'rous tongue , That laid their guilt upon my guiltless shoulders .
Pox on 't !
He's in yellow stockings .
Would you were not sick !
For , by this heaven , now at our sorrows pale , Say what thou canst , I'll go along with thee .
This can not be , By no assay of reason .
How came these things to pass ?
Tis well I am found by you .
That chain will I bestow , Be it for nothing but to spite my wife , Upon mine hostess there .
It can not be .
Whither goest thou ?
But thou must needs be sure My spirits and my place have in their power To make this bitter to thee .
Where do I dwell ?
What , worse and worse ? , With leave , Bassanio , I am half yourself , And I must freely have the half of anything That this same paper brings you .
O Cassius , Far from this country Pindarus shall run , Where never Roman shall take note of him .
For my part , I have walked about the streets , Submitting me unto the perilous night , And , thus unbraced , Casca , as you see , Have bared my bosom to the thunder-stone .
Truly , an obedient lady .
A wretched soul , bruised with adversity We bid be quiet when we hear it cry , But were we burdened with like weight of pain , As much or more we should ourselves complain .
Be not afeard .
For I am sure mine nails Are stronger than mine eyes .
Death is my son-in-law .
You'll let us in , I hope ?
I scorn you not .
Thou changed and self-covered thing , for shame !
If this be so , why blame you me to love you ?
No , sooth , sir .
Here comes Baptista .
Hence , Mardian , And bring me how he takes my death .
Twere good you do so much for charity .
She desires to speak with you in her closet ere you go to bed .
What bastard doth not ?
Pardon , master .
Romeo , come forth .
A good soft pillow for that good white head Were better than a churlish turf of France .
I promise you your kindred hath made my eyes water ere now .
You were kneeled to and importuned otherwise By all of us , and the fair soul herself Weighed between loathness and obedience , at Which end o ' th ' beam should bow .
And thought they Margaret was Hero ?
Know'st thou the youth that spoke to me erewhile ?
Thou'ld'st have , great Glamis , That which cries , "Thus thou must do , " if thou have it , And that which rather thou dost fear to do , Than wishest should be undone .
Leave it to his discretion , and let us listen to the moon .
He had none .
Armed , say you ?
Tarry a little .
Not till you have slept .
Madam , you have done me wrong , Notorious wrong .
Approach .
My breath and blood !
Tis not to me she speaks .
I neither know it nor can learn of him .
My royal cousin , teach you our princess English ?
No doubt , my lord .
Though all the world could see , None could be so abused in sight as he .
If that will not suffice , I will be bound to pay it ten times o'er , On forfeit of my hands , my head , my heart .
Switch and spurs , switch and spurs , or I'll cry a match .
Is not this man jealous ?
He shall enlarge him .
My sickness grows upon me .
Oh , lay me by my mistress ' side .
Bade him anon return and here speak with me , The which he promised .
Hoppedance cries in Tom's belly for two white herring .
Most noble Empress , you have heard of me ?
Thou shouldst rather ask if it were possible any villainy should be so rich .
And what should I do in Illyria ?
Bid him therefore consider of his ransom , which must proportion the losses we have borne , the subjects we have lost , the disgrace we have digested , which , in weight to reanswer , his pettiness would bow under .
O sirs , consider : they that set you on To do this deed will hate you for the deed .
Persuade me rather to be slave and sumpter To this detested groom .
What need you five and twenty , ten , or five To follow in a house where twice so many Have a command to tend you ?
O earth !
If thou account'st it shame , lay it on me , And therefore frolic !
Tis certain he hath passed the river Somme .
Lend me thy cloak , Sir Thomas .
But I know none , and therefore am no beast .
Crown him that , And then I grant we put a sting in him That at his will he may do danger with .
My mother .
Give mine the benefit of seigniory , And let my griefs frown on the upper hand .
Why , know'st thou any harm's intended towards him ?
Where's my son Edmund ?
I would therefore my sister had no name , sir .
I pray thee , bear my former answer back .
This kindness will I show .
He that will think to live till he be old , Give me some help !
What mercy can you render him , Antonio ?
Boy !
Your worth is very dear in my regard .
Has he never before sounded you in this business ?
And , Kate , when France is mine and I am yours , then yours is France and you are mine .
Good , i ' faith .
I have a ship Laden with gold .
Ay , so I thought .
I'll assure you , he uttered as prave words at the pridge as you shall see in a summer's day .
Bear with my weakness .
Have you importuned him by any means ?
You envy my advancement , and my friends ' .
A plague o ' both your houses !
My lord , I did intend it .
If they deny to come , Swinge me them soundly forth unto their husbands .
Oh , the cry did knock Against my very heart !
Plague on 't , an I thought he had been valiant and so cunning in fence , I'd have seen him damned ere I'd have challenged him .
Why , what a king is this !
What , is the jay more precious than the lark Because his feathers are more beautiful ?
Well , you are to call at all the alehouses and bid those that are drunk get them to bed .
His speech was like a tangled chain .
Nay , then , thou mock'st me .
It shall be done , my lord .
The heart is sorely charged .
Yes , that the king is dead .
And when he saw my best alarumed spirits , Bold in the quarrel's right , roused to the encounter , Or whether ghasted by the noise I made , Full suddenly he fled .
So quick bright things come to confusion .
Her name is Margery , indeed .
Didst thou behold Octavia ?
Then be thou jocund .
Good , good , the justice of it pleases !
O , let it not be so .
Consent to swear .
The other did not so .
Stand to 't .
You are a fool. , You , niece , provide yourself .
Hark , hark !
What call you the carriages ?
I'll go alone .
What , Brutus ?
It was my duty , sir .
Come between us , good Benvolio .
The world's a huge thing .
Strike , I say !
If 'twere no other , 'T is but so , I warrant .
Sir , here's the door .
Oh , my dear Cassio !
The Lord Mayor knocks .
Madam , I am not well .
These tidings will well comfort Cassius .
Cassius , go you into the other street And part the numbers .
But he comes armed in his fortune and prevents the slander of his wife .
Is she so hot a shrew as she's reported ?
But his flawed heart , Alack , too weak the conflict to support , 'Twixt two extremes of passion , joy and grief , Burst smilingly .
The Prince and Claudio promised by this hour To visit me. , You know your office , brother .
Fear not my government .
Hold , hold , my heart , And you , my sinews , grow not instant old , But bear me stiffly up .
Fly , therefore , noble Cassius , fly far off .
I charge you by the law , Whereof you are a well-deserving pillar , Proceed to judgment .
This hand of yours requires A sequester from liberty , fasting , and prayer ,
I pray you , give me leave .
Be patient .
Farewell .
Only foul words , and thereupon I will kiss thee .
I will do 't .
A gentleman .
How does lieutenant Cassio ?
I , sir , am Dromio .
Fie on her !
Oh , that the slave had forty thousand lives !
What may she not ?
And for their sake , In your fair minds let this acceptance take .
Only give me leave , Unworthy as I am , to follow you .
Young men's love then lies Not truly in their hearts , but in their eyes .
He is a sailmaker in Bergamo .
Tonight I take my leave .
And I in all unwillingness will go .
Here's that , I warrant you , will pay them all .
Myself have to mine own turned enemy .
Tis he .
Nor tears nor prayers shall purchase out abuses , Therefore use none .
I am to pray you not to strain my speech To grosser issues nor to larger reach Than to suspicion .
Wouldst thou not be glad to have the niggardly rascally sheep-biter come by some notable shame ?
If you will live , lament .
Faith , niece , you tax Signor Benedick too much , but he'll be meet with you , I doubt it not .
Poor bird !
Who does do you wrong ?
Wonder not till further warrant .
Would I were assured Of my condition .
How now , Horatio ?
And earthly power doth then show likest God's When mercy seasons justice .
I thank thee .
Sir Toby Belch !
They know By th' height , the lowness , or the mean , if dearth Or foison follow .
I am sent before to make a fire , and they are coming after to warm them .
Or I'll deliver thy indignation to him by word of mouth .
My banquet is to close our stomachs up , After our great good cheer .
That's a degree to love .
Think not , thou noble Roman , That ever Brutus will go bound to Rome .
There lay he , stretched along like a wounded knight .
God 'ild you for your last company .
No .
I'll see thee hanged on Sunday first .
A madness most discreet , A choking gall , and a preserving sweet .
When time shall serve , let but the herald cry , And I'll appear again .
On , on , on , on , on !
Stand close and list him .
Most mischievous foul sin in chiding sin , For thou thyself hast been a libertine , As sensual as the brutish sting itself , And all th ' embossed sores and headed evils That thou with license of free foot hast caught Wouldst thou disgorge into the general world .
She was of Carthage , not of Tunis .
My villainy ?
Thou troublest me ; I am not in the vein .
Down with him , thief !
When that the poor have cried , Caesar hath wept .
Believe me , sir , had I such venture forth , The better part of my affections would Be with my hopes abroad .
Have more than thou showest , Speak less than thou knowest , Lend less than thou owest , Ride more than thou goest , Learn more than thou trowest , Set less than thou throwest , Leave thy drink and thy whore And keep in-a-door , And thou shalt have more Than two tens to a score .
Ay , and a kind one too .
Monday , my lord .
It was some fiend .
Go , Sir Andrew .
Fear nothing .
What do you here ?
Spit , fire !
Tis the curse of service .
Away with us to Athens .
But if he had not been in drink , he would have tickled you othergates than he did .
Would ?
No , Caesar , we will answer on their charge .
Go , take it up unto thy master's use .
The ingratitude of this Seleucus does Even make me wild .
This mortal house I'll ruin , Do Caesar what he can .
I give it you .
Come , Casca , you and I will yet ere day See Brutus at his house .
And so had I , but yet , for fashion sake , I thank you too for your society .
Call Burgundy. , Cornwall and Albany , With my two daughters ' dowers digest this third .
His backward voice is to utter foul speeches and to detract .
Mad for thy love ?
Indeed he is not fit .
The murmuring surge That on th ' unnumbered idle pebbles chafes Can not be heard so high .
We'll to dinner , thither .
If he ask for me , I am ill and gone to bed .
What revels are in hand ?
Yes , he is dead .
If you thrive well , bring them to Baynard's Castle , Where you shall find me well accompanied With reverend fathers and well-learned bishops .
What , will you walk with me about the town And then go to my inn and dine with me ?
We would so , and then go a-batfowling .
Oh , he's returned , and as pleasant as ever he was .
Thou hadst , and more , Miranda .
She is cunning past man's thought .
Let him fly far .
Let us not leave him out .
The selfsame name , but one of better nature .
Thou most lying slave , Whom stripes may move , not kindness !
Tooth that poisons if it bite , Mastiff , greyhound , mongrel grim ,
Here's a maze trod indeed Through forthrights and meanders .
Pray you , look not sad , Nor make replies of loathness .
Your case is better .
Lady , will you walk a bout with your friend ?
Me believe it ?
They would be better if well followed .
Madam , I had rather , I know your lady does not love her husband .
Why , sir , you know no house nor no such maid , Nor no such men as you have reckoned up , As Stephen Sly and old John Naps of Greece , And Peter Turph and Henry Pimpernell , And twenty more such names and men as these , Which never were , nor no man ever saw .
A good swift simile , but something currish .
Pish !
Have patience , I beseech .
Soft !
How does my wife ?
Not when I saw 't .
There to meet with Macbeth .
Marry , for my part , I think the duke hath lost never a man , but one that is like to be executed for robbing a church , one Bardolph , if your Majesty know the man .
Mean you to enjoy him then ?
Casca , by your voice .
Your lordship speaks most infallibly of him .
So say I. Methinks you are sadder .
I'll be before thee .
Here were the servants of your adversary , And yours , close fighting ere I did approach .
A ring he hath of mine worth forty ducats , And for the same he promised me a chain .
Nor I .
Dearly my delicate Ariel .
And so am I for Rosalind .
Adieu .
That which is now a horse , even with a thought The rack dislimns and makes it indistinct As water is in water .
Say , if th ' hadst rather hear it from our mouths , Or from our masters ' .
I do not bid the thunder-bearer shoot , Nor tell tales of thee to high-judging Jove .
Now welcome , Kate , and bear me witness all That here I kiss her as my sovereign queen .
Where ?
Claribel .
Now from head to foot I am marble-constant .
Let me but move one question to your daughter , And by that fatherly and kindly power That you have in her , bid her answer truly .
Stay yet .
No , I protest , I know not the contents .
Let it come down .
Fie !
Who can come in and say that I mean her , When such a one as she such is her neighbor ?
Where's the Queen ?
See , it stalks away .
Before the days of change , still is it so .
It must be shortly known to him from England What is the issue of the business there .
There's five to one .
Come , I'll go in with you .
I prithee , foolish Greek , depart from me .
And thereof came it that the man was mad .
Ay , indeed !
Lepidus flatters both , Of both is flattered , but he neither loves , Nor either cares for him .
I could not forget you , for I never saw you before in all my life .
I must leave you .
Mark how the tyrant writes .
Let us , Lepidus , not lack your company .
Spoke like an officer !
What rein can hold licentious wickedness When down the hill he holds his fierce career ?
Your servants ever Have theirs , themselves , and what is theirs in compt , To make their audit at your highness ' pleasure , Still to return your own .
Faith , there has been much to do on both sides , and the nation holds it no sin to tar them to controversy .
I prithee now , ungird thy strangeness and tell me what I shall vent to my lady .
I think thou dost .
He is a very proper man .
Knock , knock !
My lord , his throat is cut .
Courteous lord , one word .
The minute of their plot Is almost come. , Well done .
I'll have my bond , and therefore speak no more .
What gentleman ?
The beds i' th' East are soft , and thanks to you , That called me timelier than my purpose hither , For I have gained by 't .
My name is Thidias .
Well .
Come on , to 't .
Will you play upon this pipe ?
Fear me not .
If any , speak , for him have I offended .
How is 't ?
Get you to your lord .
But your news is not true .
I did send To you for gold to pay my legions , Which you denied me .
He's dead .
And when I shall die , Take him and cut him out in little stars , And he will make the face of heaven so fine That all the world will be in love with night And pay no worship to the garish sun .
I will leave you now to your gossip-like humor .
There , take it , Prince .
I tell you 'tis not very well .
Hold , take my sword .
I do not bid thee call .
Be Kent unmannerly When Lear is mad .
Now , Cinna. , Now , Metellus. , What , Trebonius , I have an hour's talk in store for you .
And on that vice in him will my revenge find notable cause to work .
Hark !
My lord and brother , God save you .
God ye good morrow , gentlemen .
Indeed , they are disproportioned .
Let her hang me .
Would I were able to load him with his desert !
You are dull , Casca , and those sparks of life That should be in a Roman you do want , Or else you use not .
Fetch that gallant hither .
God help the noble Claudio !
Fare thee well .
There is more in it. , Cousin Ganymede .
Farewell .
Why , is it not news to hear of Petruchio's coming ?
O Ratcliffe , I have dreamed a fearful dream !
Out of their saddles into the dirt , and thereby hangs a tale .
Thy business ?
By this hand , I am .
No , my lord .
Farewell the plumed troops and the big wars That makes ambition virtue !
Will you yield and this avoid Or , guilty in defense , be thus destroyed ?
I prithee , vent thy folly somewhere else .
What manner o' thing is your crocodile ?
Without , my lord ; guarded , to know your pleasure .
Good now , some excellent fortune !
He made you for a highway to my bed , But I , a maid , die maiden-widowed .
So thou , that hast no unkind mate to grieve thee , With urging helpless patience would relieve me ; But , if thou live to see like right bereft , This fool-begged patience in thee will be left .
Search every acre in the high-grown field , And bring him to our eye .
I pray you , tell my lord and father , madam , I will not marry yet .
Here do I choose , and thrive I as I may !
To take the widow Exasperates , makes mad her sister Goneril , And hardly shall I carry out my side , Her husband being alive .
We'll see 'em starve first .
He did in some sort , indeed , handle women , but then he was rheumatic , and talked of the Whore of Babylon .
This is the very false gallop of verses .
Hold , for your lives !
I to the world am like a drop of water That in the ocean seeks another drop , Who , falling there to find his fellow forth , Unseen , inquisitive , confounds himself .
Happy indeed , as we have spent the day .
Octavius , then take him to follow thee , That did the latest service to my master .
I had a wound here that was like a "T , " But now 'tis made an "H." They do retire .
We follow thee. , Juliet , the county stays .
The sleeping and the dead Are but as pictures .
Oh , that a man might know The end of this day's business ere it come !
Do it .
I will go before , sir. , Mistress , look out at window , for all this .
We'll hear the will .
Thou naughty knave , what trade ?
Catesby , o'erlook the walls .
This moral ties me over to time and a hot summer .
Give me your hand .
He is a dreamer .
Thou dost talk nothing to me .
Who shall begin ?
I do never use it .
Now , by my mother's son , and that's myself , It shall be moon , or star , or what I list , Or e'er I journey to your father's house .
Wilt thou , O God , fly from such gentle lambs And throw them in the entrails of the wolf ?
Confusion now hath made his masterpiece .
More wonderful , when angels are so angry .
Far off methinks I hear the beaten drum .
Tis no matter. , Go to the fellow , good Alexas .
His neigh is like the bidding of a monarch , and his countenance enforces homage .
If this uncouth forest yield anything savage , I will either be food for it or bring it for food to thee .
Thou call'st on him that hates thee .
And thither will I straight to visit him .
I may not , madam .
She did indeed .
Some blessed power deliver us from hence !
Who does beguile you ?
Meseemeth good that with some little train Forthwith from Ludlow the young prince be fet Hither to London , to be crowned our king .
Black night o'ershade thy day , and death thy life .
Sir , this is the matter , I beseech you , remember , Nay , good my lord , for mine ease , in good faith .
The gates of mercy shall be all shut up , And the fleshed soldier , rough and hard of heart , In liberty of bloody hand , shall range With conscience wide as hell , mowing like grass Your fresh fair virgins and your flow'ring infants .
You do advance your cunning more and more .
What might you think ?
Thou shalt Go back , I warrant thee !
For the heavens , he shows me where the bachelors sit , and there live we as merry as the day is long .
Where I have learned me to repent the sin Of disobedient opposition To you and your behests , and am enjoined By holy Lawrence to fall prostrate here To beg your pardon .
Henceforward do your messages yourself .
Do so .
Hop in his walks and gambol in his eyes .
We do not know .
A good lenten answer .
Belike for want of rain , which I could well Beteem them from the tempest of my eyes .
Adieu , good Queen .
I do , This touches me in reputation .
Error i ' the bill , sir , error i ' the bill !
Pray , what do you think is his name ?
Hath homely age th ' alluring beauty took From my poor cheek ?
Or I , I promise thee .
Why , all these should be in the lanthorn , for all these are in the moon. , But silence !
I am in my condition A prince , Miranda , I do think , a king ; I would , not so ! , and would no more endure This wooden slavery than to suffer The flesh-fly blow my mouth .
Mistress , what cheer ?
You , you , sirrah , where's my daughter ?
My husband lost his life to get the crown , And often up and down my sons were tossed For me to joy , and weep , their gain and loss .
Signor Benedick !
Why , she is within .
Night hangs upon mine eyes .
Stay , though thou kill me , sweet Demetrius .
Yet here , Laertes ?
Twas where you wooed the gentlewoman so well .
Away !
Arise , you shall not kneel .
I pray you , good Bassanio , let me know it .
What life is in that to be the death of this marriage ?
I have forsworn his bed and company .
Go , coward as thou art .
So will ye , I am sure , that you love me .
He started one poor heart of mine in thee .
Ay , mistress , and Petruchio is the master , That teacheth tricks eleven and twenty long To tame a shrew and charm her chattering tongue .
I must perforce .
Here is a place reserved , sir .
No more with me .
Alas , alas !
This deed will be well welcome to Lorenzo .
Let me entreat you .
Dead ?
He hath no friends but who are friends for fear .
It were good that Benedick knew of it by some other , if she will not discover it .
Sir , she is mortal .
Haply in private .
O calm dishonourable , vile submission !
If I quench thee , thou flaming minister , I can again thy former light restore Should I repent me .
I am strong-framed .
Who does i' th' wars more than his captain can Becomes his captain's captain ; and ambition , The soldier's virtue , rather makes choice of loss Than gain which darkens him .
To tell thee thou shalt see me at Philippi .
It is hypocrisy against the devil .
Let's to bed , knight .
Take it , brave York .
A spirit ?
Sit then and talk with her .
The testament !
This same is she , and I do give you her .
If swift thought break it not , a swifter mean Shall outstrike thought , but thought will do 't , I feel .
For this relief much thanks .
He supped at my house , but I therefore shake not .
Most like .
More of this matter can not I report .
Most mighty duke , vouchsafe me speak a word .
He , of all the men that ever my foolish eyes looked upon , was the best deserving a fair lady .
Here comes another of the tribe .
Happily met , my lady and my wife .
Alas , poor hurt fowl , now will he creep into sedges .
It is a kind of history .
Fut , I should have been that I am , had the maidenliest star in the firmament twinkled on my bastardizing .
Why ?
Could I repair what she will wear in me As I can change these poor accoutrements , 'Twere well for Kate and better for myself .
She was here even now .
Off , pluck off !
Is not this true ?
Pray thee , corporal , stay .
And wast thou fain , poor father , To hovel thee with swine and rogues forlorn In short and musty straw ?
There is not chastity enough in language , Without offense , to utter them. , Thus , pretty lady , I am sorry for thy much misgovernment .
The little strength that I have , I would it were with you .
O , lady , lady , shame would have it hid .
The crowner hath sat on her and finds it Christian burial .
My men should call me "lord." I am your goodman .
This contents .
The rate , Well , Shylock , shall we be beholding to you ?
Infect her beauty , You fen-sucked fogs drawn by the powerful sun , To fall and blister !
Come with my lady hither .
I will not sleep , my lord , till I have delivered your letter .
Hail !
How does my old acquaintance of this isle ? , Honey , you shall be well desired in Cyprus , I have found great love amongst them .
And I remember the wooing of a peascod instead of her , from whom I took two cods and , giving her them again , said with weeping tears , "Wear these for my sake." We that are true lovers run into strange capers .
What news ?
Bemonster not thy feature .
Yet thou didst kill my children .
There is no world without Verona walls But purgatory , torture , hell itself .
I am glad to see your Honor .
I care not for my spirits , if my legs were not weary .
Niggard of question , but of our demands Most free in his reply .
O serpent heart hid with a flowering face !
But are you sure That Benedick loves Beatrice so entirely ?
Caesar , I shall .
Now take them up , " quoth he , "if any list." Trembled and shook , for why he stamped and swore As if the vicar meant to cozen him .
Most mighty Caesar , let me know some cause , Lest I be laughed at when I tell them so .
That you do love me , I am nothing jealous .
You have loved him well .
Which be the malefactors ?
I'll warrant him for drowning though the ship were no stronger than a nutshell and as leaky as an unstanched wench .
As a friend or an enemy ?
Sister , where thou ?
But all this did I know before .
This green plot shall be our stage , this hawthorn-brake our tiring-house , and we will do it in action as we will do it before the duke .
To Brutus ' , to Cassius ' , burn all .
I'll in to counsel them .
The last was I that felt thy tyranny .
The court awards it , and the law doth give it .
Ay , millstones , as he lessoned us to weep .
He hath done good service , lady , in these wars .
My quaint Ariel , Hark in thine ear .
Come by and by to my chamber .
Why should not we Be there in person ?
Ay , if I be alive and your mind hold and your dinner worth the eating .
The will , the will !
Kill !
Marry , sir , in her buttocks .
And now I have the boy , I will undo This hateful imperfection of her eyes .
What manner of man ?
And so it is , truly , and very notably discharged .
All ?
He tells me , my dear Gertrude , he hath found The head and source of all your son's distemper .
Cunning .
Again !
Farewell .
The day is yours .
I pray you , tell it .
He's speaking now , Or murmuring "Where's my serpent of old Nile ? " For so he calls me .
Help , Charmian , help , Iras , help !
I wear it for a memorable honor , For I am Welsh , you know , good countryman .
I'll tell you who time ambles withal , who time trots withal , who time gallops withal , and who he stands still withal .
Her blood is settled , and her joints are stiff .
Harp on it still shall I till heart-strings break .
Revolving this will teach thee how to curse .
You have my consent .
I should not then ask Casca what had chanced .
Thy lands and all things that thou dost call thine Worth seizure , do we seize into our hands Till thou canst quit thee by thy brother's mouth Of what we think against thee .
Thanks , dear my lord .
You are too much mistaken in this king .
Who is conductor of his people ?
My dagger , little cousin ?
I am glad to see you .
But didst thou hear without wondering how thy name should be hanged and carved upon these trees ?
Thus I mend it : Time himself is bald and therefore , to the world's end , will have bald followers .
O Iago !
We can not be here and there too .
O , do not do your cousin such a wrong !
Souls and bodies hath he divorced three , and his incensement at this moment is so implacable that satisfaction can be none but by pangs of death and sepulchre .
But who comes here ?
I will hence tonight .
Fare you well .
Down with the topmast !
This is the latest parle we will admit .
So I do , madonna .
The old priest at Saint Luke's Church is at your command at all hours .
Tell me , Othello .
My lord , the enemy is past the marsh .
Take you assurance of her cum privilegio ad imprimendum solum .
Hail .
Antonio and old Shylock , both stand forth .
I can not live to hear the news from England .
Let's follow the old earl , and get the Bedlam To lead him where he would .
Shall Caesar send a lie ?
Here are enemies .
I mean that my heart unto yours is knit So that but one heart we can make of it .
Do you mark that ?
Sit thee down , Clitus .
I'll about And drive away the vulgar from the streets .
Lord , what fools these mortals be !
It is a tale Told by an idiot , full of sound and fury , Signifying nothing .
Yet leave our cousin Katherine here with us .
Shall we go see the relics of this town ?
What he hath uttered I have writ my sister .
Why , how now ?
Believe not so .
What paper were you reading ?
Let me see .
I'll have some proof .
What a life is this That your poor friends must woo your company ?
This disease is beyond my practice .
Let your epilogue alone .
Good cheer , Antonio !
And so had mine .
You'll heat my blood .
Tell me , thou unknown power , He knows thy thought .
Whither will you that I go To answer this your charge ?
What a pretty thing man is when he goes in his doublet and hose and leaves off his wit !
Brief , I recovered him , bound up his wound , And after some small space , being strong at heart ,
Full oft 'tis seen , Our means secure us and our mere defects Prove our commodities .
See it done And feast the army .
You are a fishmonger .
Ere I learn love , I'll practice to obey .
Those that with haste will make a mighty fire Begin it with weak straws .
Oh , I have suffered With those that I saw suffer .
Hence with your little ones .
Your cousin , my lady , takes great exceptions to your ill hours .
Nothing ?
His answer was , the people were not used To be spoke to but by the recorder .
Things must be as they may .
You can do better yet , but this is meetly .
I have done no more to Caesar than you shall do to Brutus .
Faith , sir , so-so .
List a brief tale , And when 'tis told , oh , that my heart would burst !
Bear'st thou her face in mind ?
And jealous Oberon would have the child Knight of his train , to trace the forests wild .
Hie you to horse .
If not , he's plain .
How but well , sir ?
If thy revengeful heart can not forgive , Lo , here I lend thee this sharp-pointed sword , Which if thou please to hide in this true breast And let the soul forth that adoreth thee , I lay it naked to the deadly stroke And humbly beg the death upon my knee .
The King of Naples , being an enemy To me inveterate , hearkens my brother's suit , Which was that he , in lieu o ' th ' premises Of homage and I know not how much tribute , Should presently extirpate me and mine Out of the dukedom , and confer fair Milan With all the honors on my brother .
She was the wife of Caius Marcellus .
This will so fright them both that they will kill one another by the look , like cockatrices .
Go , hang yourselves all !
It did bass my trespass .
Fiery" ?
What are you ?
My lord , the queen would speak with you , and presently .
Thou art a villain !
But by immortal providence , she's mine .
Where's your father ?
Your dinner , and the generous islanders By you invited , do attend your presence .
I am now from home , and out of that provision Which shall be needful for your entertainment .
Till then , my noble friend , chew upon this : Brutus had rather be a villager Than to repute himself a son of Rome Under these hard conditions as this time Is like to lay upon us .
The whole butt , man .
How malicious is my fortune , that I must repent to be just !
How lost you company ?
There's magic in the web of it .
But fear not yet To take upon you what is yours .
I pray thee , peace .
She is low-voiced .
When I spoke that , I was ill-tempered too .
Give me the daggers .
The citizens are up , and Tybalt slain .
Is it come to this ?
The gentleness of all the gods go with thee !
The Queen , my lord , the Queen .
What should I do I do not ?
What can it not ?
And pluck the wings from painted butterflies To fan the moonbeams from his sleeping eyes .
I think the sun where he was born Drew all such humors from him .
The king and queen and all are coming down .
Pitiful sight !
Ariel , thy charge Exactly is performed .
Therefore , since brevity is the soul of wit And tediousness the limbs and outward flourishes , I will be brief : your noble son is mad .
Ha , ha , heard in Genoa .
O dear father , It is thy business that I go about .
To England will I steal , and there I'll steal .
Spake you of Caesar ?
He'll make your Paris Louvre shake for it , Were it the mistress court of mighty Europe .
If I had a thunderbolt in mine eye , I can tell who should down .
At the duke's oak we meet .
By such despair I should accuse myself .
Whisper her ear and tell her I and Ursula Walk in the orchard , and our whole discourse Is all of her .
Most royal majesty , I crave no more than hath your highness offered .
Indeed , indeed , sirs , but this troubles me .
Good my lord , what is your cause of distemper ?
Where is thy power , then , to beat him back ?
Simple , plain Clarence , I do love thee so That I will shortly send thy soul to heaven , If heaven will take the present at our hands .
We do not mean the coursing snatchers only , But fear the main intendment of the Scot , Who hath been still a giddy neighbor to us .
And , honest company , I thank you all , That have beheld me give away myself To this most patient , sweet and virtuous wife .
My salad days , When I was green in judgment , cold in blood , To say as I said then .
What is he for a fool that betroths himself to unquietness ?
Sir , in fine , Seeing how loathly opposite I stood To his unnatural purpose , in fell motion , With his prepared sword he charges home My unprovided body , latched mine arm .
We'll to church tomorrow .
He hath not touched you yet .
Doing is activity , and he will still be doing .
Heard you of nothing strange about the streets ?
But I perceive in you so excellent a touch of modesty that you will not extort from me what I am willing to keep in .
I can not be a man with wishing , therefore I will die a woman with grieving .
Why did you so ?
This lion is a very fox , for his valor .
She speaks .
Marry , sir , because silver hath a sweet sound .
I am no less in blood than thou art , Edmund .
The deep of night is crept upon our talk , And nature must obey necessity , Which we will niggard with a little rest .
Cassio knows you not .
We are men , my liege .
O sir , content you .
But manhood is melted into curtsies , valor into compliment , and men are only turned into tongue , and trim ones too .
What means your lordship ?
The "fiery" duke ?
Marry , I saw your niece do more favors to the Count's servingman than ever she bestowed upon me .
If we do lose this battle , then is this The very last time we shall speak together .
Poisoned , then .
He , that Caliban Whom now I keep in service .
Wert thou as young as I , Juliet thy love , An hour but married , Tybalt murdered , Doting like me , and like me banished , Then mightst thou speak , then mightst thou tear thy hair And fall upon the ground , as I do now , Taking the measure of an unmade grave .
Thou hast a lady far more beautiful Than any woman in this waning age .
I see , sir , you are eaten up with passion .
Hence !
As sweet as balm , as soft as air , as gentle , O Antony ! , Nay , I will take thee too .
Yond island carrions , desperate of their bones , Ill-favoredly become the morning field .
Thou know'st 'tis common .
That will I , should I die the hour after .
O sinful thought !
We must incline to the king .
He hath honored me of late , and I have bought Golden opinions from all sorts of people , Which would be worn now in their newest gloss , Not cast aside so soon .
I would I had thy inches .
We are such stuff As dreams are made on , and our little life Is rounded with a sleep .
Nay , it is possible enough to judgment .
How now , fellow ?
Away !
To the selfsame tune and words .
Save you , friend Cassio !
Get thee to a nunnery , go .
It is a pretty youth , not very pretty , But sure he's proud , and yet his pride becomes him .
I do beseech you , take it not amiss ; I can not , nor I will not , yield to you .
O , let me kiss that hand !
Indeed , the French may lay twenty French crowns to one they will beat us , for they bear them on their shoulders .
I sent for thee upon a sad occasion .
What wouldst thou , fellow ?
Mistress , dispatch you with your safest haste , And get you from our court .
For God's sake , send some other messenger .
Wo , ha , ho !
The boy was the very staff of my age , my very prop .
Up to some scaffold , there to lose their heads .
All but mariners Plunged in the foaming brine and quit the vessel , Then all afire with me .
This is a slight , unmeritable man , Meet to be sent on errands .
I know not , madam .
We shall know by this fellow .
Have you a soul or sense ?
I will not stay tonight for all the town .
Come , vial .
The day , my friends , and all things stay for me .
He says , my lord , your daughter is not well .
I can , Petruchio , help thee to a wife With wealth enough , and young and beauteous , Brought up as best becomes a gentlewoman .
Yet Count Claudio may hear , for what I would speak of concerns him .
To answer by the method , in the first of his heart .
For himself to mar , " quoth he ?
And let our hearts , as subtle masters do , Stir up their servants to an act of rage And after seem to chide 'em .
It is needful that you frame the season for your own harvest .
Well , I can not tell .
Tis no matter how it be in tune , so it make noise enough .
You have made me offer Of Sicily , Sardinia .
Methinks I hear Antony call .
I will tell you why .
Shall we rouse the night owl in a catch that will draw three souls out of one weaver ?
But you , O you , So perfect and so peerless , are created Of every creature's best .
When I wore it at your daughter's marriage ?
You can not revel into dukedoms there .
To business that we love we rise betimes And go to 't with delight .
My charms crack not , my spirits obey , and time Goes upright with his carriage .
Tell me at whose suit .
Go then , find me a meet hour to draw Don Pedro and the Count Claudio alone .
I made no such report .
Indeed ?
Turn , hellhound , turn !
In his tail .
Hath Leonato any son , my lord ?
What is 't thou say'st ?
He had , my lord , and when he ran in here , These people saw the chain about his neck .
Ay , madam .
News , old news , and such news as you never heard of !
Age can not wither her , nor custom stale Her infinite variety .
I have so often blushed to acknowledge him that now I am brazed to it .
Find out moonshine , find out moonshine !
Would you buy her , that you enquire after her ?
The word is too good to paint out her wickedness .
And , as the jest did glance away from me , 'T is ten to one it maimed you two outright .
Swell , bosom , with thy fraught , For 'tis of aspics ' tongues !
A maiden never bold , Of spirit so still and quiet that her motion Blushed at herself .
The king hath strictly charged the contrary .
My name is Proculeius .
I think it is not meet Mark Antony , so well beloved of Caesar , Should outlive Caesar .
In sooth , I know not why I am so sad .
Tis pitiful , but yet Iago knows That she with Cassio hath the act of shame A thousand times committed .
What have you , my good friends , deserved at the hands of fortune that she sends you to prison hither ?
You may do your will , But he's a tried and valiant soldier .
Murder !
I love her ten times more than e'er I did .
Who can be wise , amazed , temp'rate , and furious , Loyal and neutral , in a moment ?
Welcome , my lord .
Tis far off , And rather like a dream than an assurance That my remembrance warrants .
All my pretty ones ?
She speaks poniards , and every word stabs .
Not so , sir , I do care for something .
If you do love Rosalind so near the heart as your gesture cries it out , when your brother marries Aliena shall you marry her .
Are they all ready ?
We came hither to fight with you .
Fool , of thyself speak well .
Where will the old duke live ?
Oh my fair warrior !
Alas , Malvolio , this is not my writing , Though , I confess , much like the character .
Good .
I never heard So musical a discord , such sweet thunder .
Come on .
Cry but "Ay me ! " Pronounce but "love" and "dove." Speak to my gossip Venus one fair word , One nickname for her purblind son and heir , Young Abraham Cupid , he that shot so true When King Cophetua loved the beggar maid. , He heareth not , he stirreth not , he moveth not .
Virtue ?
Fare you well .
By the world , I think my wife be honest and think she is not .
Out , you green sickness , carrion !
His words were , "Farewell , mistress." Nothing else .
In Kent , my liege , the Guilfords are in arms , And every hour more competitors Flock to the rebels , and their power grows strong .
Why no , no more than reason .
So that by my foes , sir I profit in the knowledge of myself , and by my friends , I am abused .
He is as full of valor as of kindness , Princely in both .
Both , both , my girl .
Dispatch , I say , and find the forester .
Still be 't yours .
Ay , sir , the sergeant of the band ; he that brings any man to answer it that breaks his band ; one that thinks a man always going to bed and says "God give you good rest." Well , sir , there rest in your foolery .
If thou dost love fair Hero , cherish it , And I will break with her and with her father , And thou shalt have her .
For if such actions may have passage free , Bond-slaves and pagans shall our statesmen be .
There be some such , no question .
Relent , sweet Hermia , And , Lysander , yield Thy crazed title to my certain right .
Both he loves .
And so do I too , lieutenant .
When it is paid according to the tenor .
That with this little arm and this good sword I have made my way through more impediments Than twenty times your stop .
Will you sup there ?
When we shall meet at compt This look of thine will hurl my soul from heaven And fiends will snatch at it .
There is tears for his love , joy for his fortune , honor for his valor , and death for his ambition .
Such have but a shadow's bliss .
Marry , that he had received a thousand ducats of Don John for accusing the Lady Hero wrongfully .
I'll never see 't !
I am a gentleman .
As 'tis said , the bastard son of Gloucester .
And for that I promised you , I'll be as good as my word .
Thy drugs are quick .
No , my lord .
If thou canst love a fellow of this temper , Kate , whose face is not worth sunburning , that never looks in his glass for love of anything he sees there , let thine eye be thy cook .
Madam ?
Swart like my shoe , but her face nothing like so clean kept .
He did bewray his practice , and received This hurt you see striving to apprehend him .
In faith , he's penitent , And yet his trespass , in our common reason ( Save that , they say , the wars must make example Out of her best ) is not , almost , a fault T ' incur a private check .
For naught so vile that on the earth doth live But to the earth some special good doth give .
how , I pray ?
Now all the youth of England are on fire , And silken dalliance in the wardrobe lies .
What o ' that ?
And may , through all the world !
Did he receive you well ?
How say you , Signior Gremio ?
I shall offend , either to detain or give it .
And so do I .
What mean you , madam ?
O , wilt thou darkling leave me ?
But Antonio is certainly undone .
His fault is much , and the good king his master Will check him for 't .
I desire no more delight Than to be under sail and gone tonight .
I see him rouse himself To praise my noble act .
And shall , sir .
I bear no hatred , blessed man , for , lo , My intercession likewise steads my foe .
I have noted it well .
A lady , sir , though it was said she much resembled me , was yet of many accounted beautiful .
Hear me , good brother , Under your pardon .
Have I caught thee ?
All men call thee fickle .
For they were parted With foul and violent tempest .
I am sorry to find you thus .
Saw you him today ?
Good night , lieutenant , I must to the watch .
I prithee , turn aside and weep for her .
Content , in faith .
I would scarce trust myself , though I had sworn the contrary , if Hero would be my wife .
Prithee , friend , Pour out the pack of matter to mine ear , The good and bad together .
The man i ' th ' moon !
Tis a wonder , by your leave , she will be tamed so .
Hang him , foul collier !
Ay .
She false with Cassio !
An oath , an oath , I have an oath in heaven .
He hath rid his prologue like a rough colt .
Why , now , as fast as she can marry us .
And yours of Helena to me bequeath , Whom I do love and will do till my death .
Oh , my fortunes have Corrupted honest men !
Some good I mean to do Despite of mine own nature .
Ay , what of that ?
I beseech you , do me this courteous office , as to know of the knight what my offense to him is .
Why , so didst thou .
Farewell .
Where lodges he ?
I love you the better ; the hearers may cry "Amen." God match me with a good dancer !
Why , i ' faith , methinks she's too low for a high praise , too brown for a fair praise , and too little for a great praise .
How poor are they that have not patience !
Soon may I hear and see him .
O most unhappy day !
To the mines ?
Patience unmoved !
What country , friends , is this ?
They that reap must sheaf and bind , Then to cart with Rosalind .
I would not be cured , youth .
I'll go arm myself .
Ay , madam , twenty several messengers .
The capon burns ; the pig falls from the spit ; The clock hath strucken twelve upon the bell ; My mistress made it one upon my cheek .
I'll make division of my present with you .
Then let the trumpets sound The tucket sonance and the note to mount , For our approach shall so much dare the field That England shall couch down in fear and yield .
Better it were they all came by his father , Or by the father there were none at all , For emulation who shall now be nearest Will touch us all too near if God prevent not .
Is thy news good , or bad ?
Oh , be sick , great greatness , And bid thy ceremony give thee cure !
Ay , so we will .
Come hither , neighbor Seacole .
He tells me flatly there is no mercy for me in heaven because I am a Jew's daughter , and he says you are no good member of the commonwealth , for in converting Jews to Christians you raise the price of pork .
Is it a custom ?
I will die bravely , like a smug bridegroom .
Who would not have his wife so ?
Softly and swiftly , sir , for the priest is ready .
Come , let me wipe thy face .
Son , I'll be your half Bianca comes .
Yet she must die , else she'll betray more men .
Mercy , mercy !
If not , when you have stomachs .
I can not but remember such things were That were most precious to me .
He no more shall see my face .
But yet It is our trick .
I will fall prostrate at his feet And never rise until my tears and prayers Have won his grace to come in person hither And take perforce my husband from the Abbess .
But no metal can , No , not the hangman's axe , bear half the keenness Of thy sharp envy .
Grace grow where those drops fall !
Then pleaded I for you .
The Moor hath killed my mistress !
Intend a kind of zeal both to the Prince and Claudio , as in love of your brother's honor , who hath made this match , and his friend's reputation , who is thus like to be cozened with the semblance of a maid , that you have discovered thus .
Without contradiction I have heard that .
I charge thee do so , as thou art my child .
It is too rough , Too rude , too boisterous , and it pricks like thorn .
Tis a subject for a sovereign to reason on , and for a sovereign's sovereign to ride on , and for the world , familiar to us and unknown , to lay apart their particular functions and wonder at him .
We did , my lord , weeping and commenting Upon the sobbing deer .
Let him not come near me .
No .
Yes , faith , and all his lords , the Duke of Milan And his brave son being twain .
Here's one comes in his shirt , with light and weapons .
You all did see that on the Lupercal I thrice presented him a kingly crown , Which he did thrice refuse .
Now die , die , die , die , die .
But what talk we of fathers when there is such a man as Orlando ?
By sea , what else ?
There is but one mind in all these men , and it is bent against Caesar .
Prepare you , generals .
My lord and master loves you .
The all-seeing sun Ne'er saw her match since first the world begun .
Take a trumpet , herald .
I am he .
There thou shouldst be ; By this great clatter , one of the greatest note Seems bruited .
But is this law ?
Why , man ?
What , wilt thou wash him from his grave with tears ?
That he hath used thee .
Belike this is a man of that quirk .
You slave , you cur !
What says your Highness to my just request ?
Take that , and that .
All's well .
Very like a whale .
I am aweary of this moon .
Be a child o' th' time .
The noblest deer hath them as huge as the rascal .
Even so. , Cover their faces .
I'll ride your horse as well as I ride you .
Ay , good my lord .
Death , that hath sucked the honey of thy breath , Hath had no power yet upon thy beauty .
I love thee well in that thou lik'st it not .
Nothing extenuate , Nor set down aught in malice .
Our fortune on the sea is out of breath And sinks most lamentably .
Thou art a soul in bliss , but I am bound Upon a wheel of fire , that mine own tears Do scald like molten lead .
And on the answer , he pays you as surely as your feet hit the ground they step on .
The motions of his spirit are dull as night , And his affections dark as Erebus .
Nay , good , be patient .
By day and night he wrongs me .
Hence , saucy eunuch !
Yes , other men have ill luck too .
I have a mind to strike thee ere thou speak'st .
Come from thy ward , For I can here disarm thee with this stick And make thy weapon drop .
Bear with him , Brutus .
Oh , me , lieutenant !

Will you dispatch us here under this tree , or shall we go with you to your chapel ?
I defy lechery .
He has heard that word of some great man and now applies it to a fool .
O , what a fall was there , my countrymen !
Thou speak'st wiser than thou art ware of .
Why should Titania cross her Oberon ?
But lest myself be guilty to self wrong , I'll stop mine ears against the mermaid's song .
Live a little , comfort a little , cheer thyself a little .
I marvel our mild husband Not met us on the way .
And fair she is , if that mine eyes be true .
How tartly that gentleman looks !
They were suborned .
Fairly spoke .
I shall not look upon his like again .
Who can not want the thought how monstrous It was for Malcolm and for Donalbain To kill their gracious father ?
Come , come !
Away , old man .
Hear me a word , For I shall never speak to thee again .
No , I will go seek Some ditch wherein to die .
May not one speak ?
And let us do it with no show of fear , No , with no more than if we heard that England Were busied with a Whitsun morris-dance .
Then to have seen much and to have nothing is to have rich eyes and poor hands .
I would be friends with you and have your love , Forget the shames that you have stained me with , Supply your present wants and take no doit Of usance for my moneys , and you'll not hear me !
Witness , you ever-burning lights above , You elements that clip us round about , Witness that here Iago doth give up The execution of his wit , hands , heart , To wronged Othello's service .
Is it two days ago since I tripped up thy heels and beat thee before the king ?
We will , my noble lord .
Here is the money .
I had a son , Now outlawed from my blood .
What might import my sister's letter to him ?
Be subject To no sight but thine and mine , invisible To every eyeball else .
She doth stray about By holy crosses , where she kneels and prays For happy wedlock hours .
I saw Bassanio and Antonio part .
Come , go in .
Caesar hath sent , Too slow a messenger .
He is well paid that is well satisfied .
What years , i ' faith ?
Then burst his mighty heart , And , in his mantle muffling up his face , Even at the base of Pompey's statue , Which all the while ran blood , great Caesar fell .
Well , Catesby , ere a fortnight make me older I'll send some packing that yet think not on 't .
Signior ?
I have as much of my father in me as you , albeit , I confess , your coming before me is nearer to his reverence .
I would not spare my brother in this case If he should scorn me so apparently .
Have the pioneers given o'er ?
My grandam told me he was murdered there .
You call me misbeliever , cutthroat dog , And spet upon my Jewish gaberdine , And all for use of that which is mine own .
If not , your pardon and my return shall be the end of my business .
How came she by that light ?
Lord , Lord , she will be a joyful woman .
Not mad , but bound more than a madman is , Shut up in prison , kept without my food , Whipped and tormented and , Good e'en , good fellow .
Here , catch this casket .
Call Philostrate .
Known unto these , and to myself disguised !
Only in the world I fill up a place which may be better supplied when I have made it empty .
A segregation of the Turkish fleet .
If it might please you to enforce no further The griefs between ye , to forget them quite Were to remember that the present need Speaks to atone you .
But come what sorrow can , It can not countervail the exchange of joy That one short minute gives me in her sight .
Nay , you must name his name , and half his face must be seen through the lion's neck .
Nay , rather persuade him to hold his hands .
My father , poorly led ?
Why , then , some be of laughing , as , ah , ha , he !
And is it not well served into a sweet goose ?
A marvelous witty fellow , I assure you , but I will go about with him. , Come you hither , sirrah , a word in your ear .
O most false love !
Alas , I sent you money to redeem you By Dromio here , who came in haste for it .
And when please you to say so ?
Hark , canst thou hear me ?
Come , come , away .
Get thee gone .
Why call you me "love" ?
Let music sound while he doth make his choice .
Consider how it stands upon my credit .
So swift a pace hath thought that even now You may imagine him upon Blackheath , Where that his lords desire him to have borne His bruised helmet and his bended sword Before him through the city .
What is his name ?
Go fetch them hither .
Another general shout !
As I do live , my honored lord , 'tis true .
I once did lend my body for his wealth , Which but for him that had your husband's ring Had quite miscarried .
Thy spirit walks abroad and turns our swords In our own proper entrails .
Most kind messenger , Say to great Caesar this in deputation : I kiss his conqu'ring hand .
O Lord , I must laugh .
If th ' other two be brained like us , the state totters .
Let's see .
Therefore , I beseech your Highness pardon me .
Whose noise is this that ones on murder ?
A baubling vessel was he captain of , For shallow draught and bulk unprizable , With which such scathful grapple did he make With the most noble bottom of our fleet , That very envy and the tongue of loss Cried fame and honor on him. , What's the matter ?
Could you not take some occasion without giving ?
Come , gentlemen , Let us consult upon tomorrow's business Into my tent .
Sir , you are very welcome to our house .
Aroint thee , witch ! " the rump-fed runnion cries .
Yet keep the French the field .
A very handsome man .
O Lord , Lord , it is a hard matter for friends to meet , but mountains may be removed with earthquakes and so encounter .
I think it doth .
Come , thou mortal wretch , With thy sharp teeth this knot intrinsicate Of life at once untie .
If I owe you anything , I will pay you in cudgels .
A thousand times the worse to want thy light .
Marcus Octavius , Marcus Justeius , Publicola , and Caelius , are for sea ; But we keep whole by land .
You will have Gremio to keep you fair .
It is a massy wheel Fixed on the summit of the highest mount , To whose huge spokes ten thousand lesser things Are mortised and adjoined , which , when it falls , Each small annexment , petty consequence , Attends the boisterous ruin .
As far , my lord , as will fill up the time 'Twixt this and supper .
And to that end we wished your Lordship here T ' avoid the censures of the carping world .
Why , what's the matter ?
Adieu .
By th ' law of arms thou wast not bound to answer An unknown opposite .
I can no more .
Ay , that he was .
Tis sport to maul a runner .
What , we have many goodly days to see !
Then never man was man true .
For both , my lord .
O God , Horatio , what a wounded name , Things standing thus unknown , shall live behind me !
A good persuasion .
I am heartily glad I came hither to you .
Master , master , look about you .
Come , go with me .
Oh , by no means .
You have spoken truer than you purposed .
We are sent To give thee from our royal master thanks , Only to herald thee into his sight , Not pay thee .
Captain Macmorris , I beseech you now , will you voutsafe me , look you , a few disputations with you as partly touching or concerning the disciplines of the war , the Roman wars ?
I can hardly forbear hurling things at him .
If haply you my father do suspect An instrument of this your calling back , Lay not your blame on me .
A good man's fortune may grow out at heels .
How long within this wood intend you stay ?
Where is she ?
What lawful quest have given their verdict up Unto the frowning judge ?
Tis a pageant , To keep us in false gaze .

And I , my royal sovereign .
My father's love is enough to honor him .
I will talk further with you .
I would your grace would constrain me to tell .
How say you by this change ?
Shall I strike at it with my partisan ?
Is your Englishman so expert in his drinking ?
For doting , not for loving , pupil mine .
What would my lord ?
My precious Queen , forbear , And give true evidence to his love which stands An honorable trial .
The messengers !
I say , this house is as dark as ignorance , though ignorance were as dark as hell .
Think of me as you please .
Come , I will have thee , but , by this light , I take thee for pity .
Husband ?
Let every soldier hew him down a bough And bear 't before him .
I prithee , call him back .
Will you deny me now ?
My dearest coz , I pray you school yourself .
I know no ways to mince it in love , but directly to say , "I love you." Then if you urge me farther than to say , "Do you , in faith ? " I wear out my suit .
Thy half o ' th ' kingdom hast thou not forgot , Wherein I thee endowed .
Thank you .
And supportable To make the dear loss have I means much weaker Than you may call to comfort you , for I Have lost my daughter .
Well , go to , I will .
Four legs and two voices , a most delicate monster .
Even here Do we shake hands .
But soft , but soft a while .
Marry , it is your brother's right hand .
Arise , dissembler .
No words .
For , look you , how cheerfully my mother looks , and my father died within these two hours .
Be patient till the last .
She's dead , my Queen .
One doth not know How much an ill word may empoison liking .
He is no less than a stuffed man .
Why , this is evident to any formal capacity .
Howe'er thou art a fiend , A woman's shape doth shield thee .
It shines everywhere .
But I have cause to pry into this pedant .
Fulvia thy wife is dead .
I will weary you then no longer with idle talking .
Indeed ?
Home , you idle creatures get you home !
Well then , confess and live .
I prithee let me have it .
Is this true ?
But yet do I believe The origin and commencement of his grief Sprung from neglected love. , How now , Ophelia ?
Before my God , I might not this believe Without the sensible and true avouch Of mine own eyes .
But did'st thou see them dead ?
I am an ass ; else it could never be But I should know her as well as she knows me .
Nay , I know not .
Get thee to bed , Francisco .
What shall I say ?
I will go with thee .
Can anything be made of this ?
Avoid , and leave him .
And for Cassio , let me be his undertaker .
Yet I insisted ; yet you answered not , But with an angry wafture of your hand Gave sign for me to leave you .
And the tears of it are wet .
I come to thee for charitable license , That we may wander o'er this bloody field To book our dead and then to bury them ; To sort our nobles from our common men , For many of our princes , woe the while ! , Lie drowned and soaked in mercenary blood .
Plantagenet .
I know I can do it .
No .
Thou art armed , Gloucester .
It pleases your Worship to say so , but we are the poor duke's officers .
Mark me .
All take hands .
Yes , Cassius .
Were not my doors locked up and I shut out ?
Oh , if it prove , Tempests are kind and salt waves fresh in love !
I must Once in a month recount what thou hast been , Which thou forget'st .
God's benison go with you and with those That would make good of bad and friends of foes .
By so much the more shall I tomorrow be at the height of heart-heaviness , by how much I shall think my brother happy in having what he wishes for .
Go to , you are too shrewd .
Said he not so ?
I am sure he had more hair of his tail than I have of my face when I last saw him .
I do not think so .
Do not believe That , from the sense of all civility , I thus would play and trifle with your reverence .
When I do name him , let it be thy part To praise him more than ever man did merit .
There let him sink , and be the seas on him !
Things growing are not ripe until their season .
I will be bitter with him and passing short .
Oh , rarely base !
sits. , I did never think that lady would have loved any man .
To move is to stir , and to be valiant is to stand .
Were you well served , you would be taught your duty .
It is so .
Thou liest , malignant thing !
This doth betoken The corse they follow did with desperate hand Fordo its own life .
For this present , I would not , so with love I might entreat you , Be any further moved .
It will be rain tonight .
Chop off his head .
Why should calamity be full of words ?
Lo , here I lie , Never to rise again .
I never did like molestation view On the enchafed flood .
A tomb Must cover thy sweet eyes .
Dost thou live by thy tabour ?
O , gentlemen , see , see dead Henry's wounds Open their congealed mouths and bleed afresh ! , Blush , blush , thou lump of foul deformity , For 'tis thy presence that exhales this blood From cold and empty veins where no blood dwells .
Here is the man .
He is my prisoner .
Even for the blood That then I lost for thee , now grant me justice .
I wonder none of you have thought of him .
I know , " quoth he , "no house , no wife , no mistress." So that my errand , due unto my tongue , I thank him , I bare home upon my shoulders , For , in conclusion , he did beat me there .
If God will be avenged for this deed , O , know you yet He doth it publicly !
Suppose th ' Ambassador from the French comes back , Tells Harry that the king doth offer him
Tarry , Jew .
Thy life hath had some smatch of honor in it .
Take heed , Signior Baptista , lest you be cony-catched in this business .
Fare you well , sir .
Look , look .
As good a gentleman as the emperor .
Oh , sweet England !
Antonio , O my dear Antonio !
By the apostle Paul , shadows tonight Have struck more terror to the soul of Richard Than can the substance of ten thousand soldiers Armed in proof and led by shallow Richmond .
Let's hear him , for the things he speaks may concern Caesar .
But now , my lord .
Marry , I remember it well .
Here comes his body , mourned by Mark Antony , who , though he had no hand in his death , shall receive the benefit of his dying , a place in the commonwealth , as which of you shall not ?
Barnardo has my place .
I think it lacks of twelve .
O Sisters three , Come , come to me With hands as pale as milk .
Bid Gloucester think of this , and he will weep .
I tell you true .
Take away the fool , gentlemen .
Thou old unhappy traitor , Briefly thyself remember .
And did you leave him in this contemplation ?
I prithee , boy , run to the senate house .
Roderigo killed ?
Come , go .
Marry , this is miching
Raise up the Montagues .
Well , I am not fair , and therefore I pray the gods make me honest .
World , world , O world !
My pretty cousins , you mistake me both .
Shall we shog ?
They have said their prayers , and they stay for death .
I do desire no more .
I go .
I would be sorry , sir , but the fool should be as oft with your master as with my mistress : I think I saw your wisdom there .
And Cassius too .
And that same vengeance doth He hurl on thee For false forswearing and for murder too .
Come , shall we fall to work ?
It sounds no more , and sure , it waits upon Some god o ' th ' island .
Good sir , draw near to me .
Are they married , think you ?
Let me comply with you in this garb , lest my extent to the players , which , I tell you , must show fairly outwards , should more appear like entertainment than yours .
Run to your houses , fall upon your knees , Pray to the gods to intermit the plague That needs must light on this ingratitude .
See , who comes here ?
I say a devil .
I wonder if the lion be to speak .
Why , how now , Count , wherefore are you sad ?
Come , Balthasar , we'll hear that song again .
Twas full two years ere I could get a tooth .
Canidius , Our nineteen legions thou shalt hold by land , And our twelve thousand horse .
If thou didst ever thy dear father love , O God !
Why , he is the Prince's jester , a very dull fool , only his gift is in devising impossible slanders .
Yes , sir , but anger hath a privilege .
I have no food for thee .
Yet in faith , if you did , it would not much approve me .
Ha ?
To her , my lord , Was I betrothed ere I saw Hermia .
Tis time to part .
O villain !
Some must go off .
Then let them use us well , else let them know , The ills we do , their ills instruct us so .
Yet I hate not Orlando .
Pardon , dear father .
Who , queasy with his insolence already , Will their good thoughts call from him .
Oh , fie , fie , fie !
No "master , " sir , but a poor man's son .
Nay , I prithee , put on this gown and this beard .
I'll ride home tomorrow , Sir Toby .
There will we dine .
Good morrow , Kate , for that's your name , I hear .
Bad is the world , and all will come to naught When such ill dealing must be seen in thought .
But how hath she received his love ?
No , sir .
Shame , and eternal shame , nothing but shame !
Thou look'st cheerly , and I'll be with thee quickly .
Out of doubt he is transported .
Fortune is merry , And in this mood will give us anything .
Katherine his daughter and with her , to dowry , Some petty and unprofitable dukedoms .
The worst fault you have is to be in love .
And then the moon , like to a silver bow New bent in heaven , shall behold the night Of our solemnities .
My Lord Constable , the armor that I saw in your tent tonight , are those stars or suns upon it ?
But new struck nine .
This blows my heart .
Ay , past all surgery .
Be comforted , good madam .
Signior Baptista , will you be so strange ?
Go , my dread lord , to your great-grandsire's tomb , From whom you claim .
But speak you on .
Say that they slack their duties
Each new morn New widows howl , new orphans cry , new sorrows Strike heaven on the face , that it resounds As if it felt with Scotland and yelled out Like syllable of dolor .
How fares your majesty ?
Your Honor's players , hearing your amendment , Are come to play a pleasant comedy , For so your doctors hold it very meet , Seeing too much sadness hath congealed your blood , And melancholy is the nurse of frenzy .
Say , my spirit , How fares the king and 's followers ?
Ay , sir , they be ready .
Let me endure your wrath , if 't be not so .
Prithee , be content .
I am ready now .
Meantime , but think how I may do thee good , And be inheritor of thy desire .
And then the justice , In fair round belly with good capon lined , With eyes severe and beard of formal cut , Full of wise saws and modern instances ; And so he plays his part .
This wind you talk of , blows us from ourselves .
O Dardanius !
It is not yet near day .
I said so , dear Katherine ; and I must not blush to affirm it .
I am not furnished with the present money .
If I do so , it will be of more price Being spoke behind your back than to your face .
I can not say "whore , " It does abhor me now I speak the word .
I prithee , put them off .
Whither is he going ?
Why should he not ?
And am I then revenged
I serve you , madam .
To th' monument !
We'll have thee , as our rarer monsters are , Painted on a pole , and underwrit , "Here may you see the tyrant." I will not yield , To kiss the ground before young Malcolm's feet , And to be baited with the rabble's curse .
The hearts of old gave hands , But our new heraldry is hands , not hearts .
And brief , good mother , for I am in haste .
I say she never did invent this letter .
Now , Catesby , what says his grace ?
Sweetest nut hath sourest rind ; Such a nut is Rosalind .
They're busy within .
Look where it comes again !
This accident is not unlike my dream , Belief of it oppresses me already .
I pray you , one of you question yond man , if he for gold will give us any food .
Our worser thoughts heavens mend .
Scurvy knave !
But it is no matter .
What , shall this speech be spoke for our excuse ?
Why , she hath a face of her own .
I do remember me , Henry the Sixth Did prophesy that Richmond should be king , When Richmond was a little peevish boy .
And did not she herself revile me there ?
Nothing .
Our instruments to melancholy bells , Our wedding cheer to a sad burial feast .
Hie , make haste , Make haste .
We'll go to supper i ' th ' morning .
You are as well provided of both as any prince in the world .
When are you married , madam ?
Come , let's do so .
To thee a woman's services are due .
Where is he ?
A monster , a very monster in apparel , and not like a Christian footboy or a gentleman's lackey .
Octavia is of a holy , cold , and still conversation .
Yet this is your harmless fairy , monster .
Why , to keep one's eyes of either side 's nose , that what a man can not smell out , he may spy into .
Why , what canst thou tell , my boy ?
I call thee by the most modest terms , for I am one of those gentle ones that will use the devil himself with courtesy .
I must employ you in some business Against our nuptial and confer with you Of something nearly that concerns yourselves .
Shall I deny you ?
There lock yourself and send him word you are dead .
May it be done ?
He brings you figs .
I will , my lord .
On .
Bind fast his corky arms .
Before the time I did Lysander see Seemed Athens as a paradise to me .
Well , well , put up your sword .
Yet I have known those which have walked in their sleep who have died holily in their beds .
Now I perceive they have conjoined all three To fashion this false sport , in spite of me. , Injurious Hermia !
What dost thou with thy best apparel on ?
You should ask me what time o ' day .
I have done no harm .
Adieu , good neighbor .
O me !
Ay , and I'll give them him without a fee .
This did I fear , but thought he had no weapon , For he was great of heart .
It begins "Hold thy peace." I shall never begin if I hold my peace .
I pray you , fail me not .
Repent but you that you shall lose your friend , And he repents not that he pays your debt .
You sunburnt sicklemen of August weary , Come hither from the furrow and be merry .
Tis bootless to exclaim .
The elements be kind to thee and make Thy spirits all of comfort !
How now ?
Woo't fight ?
I thank it , poor fool , it keeps on the windy side of care .
Faith , he is posted hence on serious matter .
What shall I call thee when thou art a man ?
Wherefore to Dover ?
I am the man .
Why , the honest men .
Who is it that complains unto the king That I , forsooth , am stern and love them not ?
He knows that you embrace not Antony As you did love , but as you feared him .
Why , I am glad on 't .
Oh , such another sleep , that I might see But such another man !
I have years on my back forty- eight .
Give me thy hand .
Therefore , put money in thy purse .
Is 't like that lead contains her ?
One of them rates All that is won and lost .
Wherefore ?
I'll not deny him anything I have , No , not my body , nor my husband's bed .
Beshrew him for 't !
How does Hamlet ?
If Sir Toby would leave drinking , thou wert as witty a piece of Eve's flesh as any in Illyria .
My lord ?
Shall I go fetch your nightgown ?
But if you have a stomach , to 't , i ' God's name : You shall have me assisting you in all .
So do the kings of France unto this day , Howbeit they would hold up this Salic law To bar your Highness claiming from the female And rather choose to hide them in a net Than amply to imbar their crooked titles Usurped from you and your progenitors .
Tis no such matter .
My soul doth tell me Hero is belied , And that shall Claudio know ; so shall the Prince And all of them that thus dishonor her .
How will you live ?
Do not rise yet .
Godden to your Worship , good Captain James .
Twill be a good way , and tomorrow the wrestling is .
How now , who calls ?
Mine speak of seventy senators that died By their proscriptions , Cicero being one .
There comes an old man and his three sons , I could match this beginning with an old tale .
It is but trash .
Ay , to me .
Sovereign of Egypt , hail !
Did she see thee the while , old boy ?
Had my lips that power , Thus would I wear them out .
And turns the sun to shade .
What sayest thou , Biondello ?
Trouble him no more Till further settling .
Return with her ?
Stop it , Marcellus .
I'll lay fourteen of my teeth , and yet , to my teen be it spoken , I have but four , she is not fourteen .
Why , the night gone by .
His countenance likes me not .
She'll close and be herself whilst our poor malice Remains in danger of her former tooth .
Use Desdemona well .
We looked not for Mark Antony here .
Nay , let me alone for swearing .
That nature , which contemns its origin Can not be bordered certain in itself .
What infinite heart's ease Must kings neglect that private men enjoy ?
Why , sir , her name's a word , and to dally with that word might make my sister wanton .
I am aweary .
I will not disclose 'em .
I am not bid for love .
An if your wife be not a madwoman , And know how well I have deserved the ring , She would not hold out enemy forever For giving it to me .
You are welcome , sir .
Lechery !
There's another .
For there was never yet fair woman but she made mouths in a glass .
How can these things in me seem scorn to you , Bearing the badge of faith to prove them true ?
Then weigh what loss your honor may sustain If with too credent ear you list his songs , Or lose your heart , or your chaste treasure open To his unmastered importunity .
Go fetch fire .
You shall have none ill , sir , for I'll try if they can lick their fingers .
I will construe to them whence you come .
By my troth , thou hast an open hand .
He holds me well .
No epilogue , I pray you , for your play needs no excuse .
I'll sell all my land .
In thy foul throat thou liest .
Mark Antony , shall we give sign of battle ?
Nor I know not Where I did lodge last night .
You know , he brought me out o ' favor with my lady about a bear-baiting here .
If a Jew wrong a Christian , what is his humility ?
Thyself a queen , for me that was a queen , Outlive thy glory , like my wretched self .
A most miraculous work in this good king , Which often since my here-remain in England I have seen him do .
A good old commander and a most kind gentleman .
And , as you said ( and wisely was it said ) 'T is meet that some more audience than a mother , Since nature makes them partial , should o'erhear The speech , of vantage .
Truly , she makes a very good report o' th' worm .
Before God , and in my mind , very wise .
O earth , which this blood drink'st revenge his death !
Unarm , Eros .
The business of this man looks out of him .
And so falls it out With Rivers , Vaughan , Grey ; and so 'twill do With some men else that think themselves as safe As thou and I , who , as thou know'st , are dear To princely Richard and to Buckingham .
Go to your rest .
Take him up gently , and to bed with him , And each one to his office when he wakes .
We can not all be masters , nor all masters Can not be truly followed .
How do you , Cassio ? , Oh , a chair , a chair !
Foul weather ?
What , my lord ?
I cry you mercy .
Then every soldier kill his prisoners .
An Englishman ?
Most gracious majesty !
Then 'tis he : the rest That are within the note of expectation Already are i ' th ' court .
Behold : it is the privilege of mine honors , My oath , and my profession .
With lawyers in the vacation , for they sleep between term and term , and then they perceive not how time moves .
Hark thee , Clitus .
Letters , my lord , from Hamlet .
My lord , I have considered in my mind The late request that you did sound me in .
Here , sir !
Well , time is the old justice that examines all such offenders , and let time try .
I charge thee , tempt me not .
Thy truth then be thy dower .
Thou dost belie her , and thou art a devil .
As I stood here below , methought his eyes Were two full moons .
The sun not yet thy sighs from heaven clears , Thy old groans ring yet in my ancient ears .
Those that do die of it do seldom or never recover .
Then know that from my soul I love thy daughter .
I am not made of stones , But penetrable to your kind entreaties , Albeit against my conscience and my soul .
Go sleep , and hear us .
Are these things spoken , or do I but dream ?
What soldiers , patch ?
And yet , by the very fangs of malice I swear , I am not that I play .
But let your fair eyes and gentle wishes go with me to my trial , wherein , if I be foiled , there is but one shamed that was never gracious ; if killed , but one dead that was willing to be so .
Tis a match .
Rome , thou hast lost the breed of noble bloods !
In my school days , when I had lost one shaft , I shot his fellow of the selfsame flight The selfsame way with more advised watch To find the other forth , and by adventuring both , I oft found both .
You have no stomach , Signior .
Therefore this project
She rendered life , Thy name so buried in her .
Take up the sword again , or take up me .
He has no children .
I hear their drum .
doth sway my life." Nay , but first , let me see , let me see , let me see .
I'll send to one in Mantua , Where that same banished runagate doth live , Shall give him such an unaccustomed dram That he shall soon keep Tybalt company .
I'll leave you , lady .
And be all traitors that do so ?
You shall have the mustard Or else you get no beef of Grumio .
I'll not answer that But say it is my humour .
I hope my noble lord esteems me honest .
Only he hath not yet subscribed this : Where your Majesty demands that the king of France , having any occasion to write for matter of grant , shall name your Highness in this form and with this addition , in French : Nor this I have not , brother , so denied But your request shall make me let it pass .
Speak what we feel , not what we ought to say .
Le chien est retourne a son propre vomissement , et la truie lavee au bourbier." Thou mak'st use of anything .
No , my good lord .
I say it is the moon .
Let me not hinder , Cassius , your desires .
There is not enough leek to swear by .
I would give all my fame for a pot of ale , and safety .
My lord !
You , Nick Bottom , are set down for Pyramus .
I will , my lord .
My daughter !
And not a jot of "Tranio" in your mouth .
God's arm strike with us !
I have no more sons of the royal blood For thee to slaughter .
My lord , we will not .
Thou never shalt hear herald anymore .
Howl , howl , howl , howl !
Borachio .
Did you see Master Lorenzo ?
Marry , do I , sir , and I came to acquaint you with a matter .
You could , for a need , study a speech of some dozen or sixteen lines which I would set down and insert in 't , could you not ?
He has no more directions in the true disciplines of the wars , look you , of the Roman disciplines , than is a puppy dog .
Unhappy fortune !
It is something of my negligence , nothing of my purpose .
Both ?
Will you not tell me who told you so ?
I will have my bond .
Yet once again proclaim it publicly , If any friend will pay the sum for him , He shall not die ; so much we tender him .
I cry your worships ' mercy , heartily. , I beseech your worship's name .
We will speak further .
No , and swears she never will .
Follow , follow !
Since thou dost give me pains , Let me remember thee what thou hast promised , Which is not yet performed me .
This is more strange Than such a murder is .
My visor is Philemon's roof ; within the house is Jove .
Oh , now you weep , and , I perceive , you feel The dint of pity .
I speak not like a dotard nor a fool , As under privilege of age to brag What I have done being young , or what would do Were I not old .
Give me some little breath , some pause , dear lord , Before I positively speak in this .
It is good to grow .
Your friends at Pomfret , they do need the priest ; Your Honor hath no shriving work in hand .
Where's Dolabella , To second Proculeius ?
My master , and my lord !
Oh , 'tis treason !
I follow him to serve my turn upon him .
The handkerchief !
I am dying , Egypt , dying .
And so did I .
I thank you .
Your features , Lord warrant us !
He himself Calls her a nonpareil .
Hold , there's half my coffer .
And what's to come of my despised time Is naught but bitterness .
Are they returned ?
My dearest cousin and my dearer lord ?
I speak to thee plain soldier .
Then would to Heaven that I had never seen 't !
How durst you , villains , bring it from the dresser And serve it thus to me that love it not ?
Judgment ?
Yes .
Think'st thou I jest ?
Thou art a cobbler , art thou ?
No , I warrant your Grace you shall not entreat him to a second , that have so mightily persuaded him from a first .
She has spoke what she should not , I am sure of that .
Where are they ?
Nay , but I bar tonight .
The wildest hath not such a heart as you .
Oh , it offends me to the soul to hear a robustious periwig-pated fellow tear a passion to tatters , to very rags , to split the ears of the groundlings , who for the most part are capable of nothing but inexplicable dumb-shows and noise .
Take the fool away .
He is indeed a horse , and all other jades you may call beasts .
Madam , I am here .
Conception is a blessing , but , as your daughter may conceive , Friend , look to 't .
His leg is but so-so , and yet 'tis well .
My husband say that she was false !
What means this shouting ?
Now , by Saint Peter's Church and Peter too , He shall not make me there a joyful bride .
That ever I should call thee castaway !
This I wonder at , That he , unknown to me , should be in debt .
What hast thou found ?
I am glad of it .
Call the clotpoll back .
So please you , we will stand and watch your pleasure .
By Cheshu , he will maintain his argument as well as any military man in the world in the disciplines of the pristine wars of the Romans .
Ay , be so , good Touchstone .
Cut my lace , Charmian , come !
Woe , alas !
She's not fourteen .
Beg another of thy daughters .
Sir , shall I to this lady ?
Alas , poor rogue , I think indeed she loves me .
Remember it , my lord ?
Hast thou not dropped from heaven ?
What is the time o ' th ' day ?
I am not Stephano , but a cramp .
Therefore prepare you .
Oh , how I long to have some chat with her !
Too well what love women to men may owe .
Nay , you were a fragment Of Gneius Pompey's , besides what hotter hours , Unregistered in vulgar fame , you have Luxuriously picked out .
Renown and grace is dead .
Thou hast harped my fear aright .
Tell me why .
Doth not the day break here ?
Demetrius loves your fair .
Once more , adieu .
I am he that is so love-shaked .
Think of it .
Fare you well .
Therefore he that can not lick his fingers goes not with me .
What is the matter , my lord ?
Where's Publius ?
Bid me tear the bond .
Oh , my daughter !
To die , to sleep .
No , I am promised forth .
How likes Gremio these quick-witted folks ?
When thou wakest , if she be by , Beg of her for remedy .
Farewell , and thanks .
Past question , for thou seest it will not curl by nature .
So every bondman in his own hand bears The power to cancel his captivity .
Not that I love you not .
No , fair princess .
Ha ?
And I know not what's spent in the search .
Your answer , sir , is enigmatical .
Your Grace is too costly to wear every day .
Oh , curse of marriage That we can call these delicate creatures ours And not their appetites !
And then , sir , does he this , he does , What was I about to say ?
Did you ne'er hear say , "Two may keep counsel , putting one away" ?
Nor I , assure thee , Regan. , Edmund , I hear that you have shown your father A childlike office .
Is the sword unswayed ?
But what's your jest ?
I give away myself for you and dote upon the exchange .
Is 't possible , friend Litio , that mistress Bianca Doth fancy any other but Lucentio ?
I am more an antique Roman than a Dane .
For the intent and purpose of the law Hath full relation to the penalty , Which here appeareth due upon the bond .
Traverse , go , provide thy money .
Thrice noble lord , let me entreat of you To pardon me yet for a night or two , Or if not so , until the sun be set .
Sport royal , I warrant you .
Hie you , make haste , for it grows very late .
I pray you , dissuade him from her .
Who is 't that hinders you ?
Courage .
O upright , just , and true-disposing God , How do I thank thee that this carnal cur Preys on the issue of his mother's body And makes her pew-fellow with others ' moan !
I will seek him , sir , presently , convey the business as I shall find means , and acquaint you withal .
Kind gentlemen , your pains Are registered where every day I turn The leaf to read them .
Well , but what's o'clock ?
She is not worth thee , then .
O lamentable day !
Will you lead , lords ?
Thou shalt not stir one foot to seek a foe .
This Caesar was a tyrant .
There is no tarrying here .
In cases of defense 'tis best to weigh The enemy more mighty than he seems .
Good night .
For shame , put on your gown .
Peace , you dull fool .
I am sorry for thee , friend .
We have two hours To furnish us .
I am not in the giving vein today .
To 't , luxury , pell-mell , for I lack soldiers .
Go with my brothers to my lords of England .
And I do think , or else this brain of mine Hunts not the trail of policy so sure As it hath used to do , that I have found The very cause of Hamlet's lunacy .
When I presented Ceres , I thought to have told thee of it , but I feared Lest I might anger thee .
Where is he ?
Gremio , 'tis now no time to vent our love .
Our whole city is much bound to him .
Tis like the howling of Irish wolves against the moon .
How canst thou cross this marriage ?
Are you a comedian ?
What sayst thou to him ?
My lord , you know I love you .
No , he hath simply the best wit of any handicraft man in Athens .
There will she hide her To listen our propose .
Let none presume To wear an undeserved dignity .
Most heavy day !
Art thou mad ?
But what a fool am I to chat with you , When I should bid good morrow to my bride And seal the title with a lovely kiss !
Oh , she will sing the savageness out of a bear !
Let me shun that .
Fear not , my lord .
I did not , gentle husband , lock thee forth .
Ay , my lord .
You have done well , That men must lay their murders on your neck .
Upon my sword .
I go , sir , but I would not have you to think that my desire of having is the sin of covetousness .
You did know How much you were my conqueror , and that My sword , made weak by my affection , would Obey it on all cause .
Believe me , sir , It carries a brave form .
Thy Juliet is alive , For whose dear sake thou wast but lately dead , There art thou happy .
Well then , now Have you considered of my speeches ?
Come , draw the curtain , Nerissa .
Tush , Gremio .
Well roared , Lion !
I had rather to adopt a child than get it. , Come hither , Moor .
He was a man .
No , good mother .
She replied It should be better he became her guest , Which she entreated .
That hath made him mad .
He will not know what all but he do know .
I did hear The galloping of horse .
Young man , have you challenged Charles the wrestler ?
Where I have come , great clerks have purposed To greet me with premeditated welcomes , Where I have seen them shiver and look pale , Make periods in the midst of sentences , Throttle their practiced accent in their fears , And in conclusion dumbly have broke off , Not paying me a welcome .
The prayers of holy saints and wronged souls , Like high-reared bulwarks , stand before our faces .
When you are gentle , you shall have one too , And not till then .
It is so .
Let's take leave of him .
Your servant Kent .
I do think there is mettle in death , which commits some loving act upon her , she hath such a celerity in dying .
What says he of our marriage ?
But you must learn to know such slanders of the age , or else you may be marvelously mistook .
I have almost slipped the hour .
I would I were thy bird .
Poor and content is rich , and rich enough , But riches fineless is as poor as winter To him that ever fears he shall be poor .
By and by .
I will be here again , even with a thought .
Methinks our garments are now as fresh as when we put them on first in Afric , at the marriage of the king's fair daughter Claribel to the King of Tunis .
Good morrow , Brutus .
And death , not Romeo , take my maidenhead !
But , hold thee , take this garland on thy brow .
Thus I do escape the sorrow Of Antony's death .
Tomorrow shall you know our mind at full .
Ay , marry , must you .
Sir , my liege , Do not infest your mind with beating on The strangeness of this business .
And I , my lord .
Pray God , sir , your wife send you not a worse .
But as yet , I swear , I can not truly say how I came here .
Have you heard of no likely wars toward 'twixt the two Dukes of Cornwall and Albany ?
Saving your merry humor , here's the note How much your chain weighs to the utmost carat , The fineness of the gold , and chargeful fashion , Which doth amount to three-odd ducats more Than I stand debted to this gentleman .
Good sooth , even thus .
Open your gates .
Fortune now To my heart's hope !
The honor is sacred which he talks on now , Supposing that I lacked it. , But , on , Caesar .
We will persuade him , be it possible , To put on better ere he go to church .
Speak , hands , for me !
What is 't o'clock ?
Sweet mistress , what your name is else I know not , Nor by what wonder you do hit of mine , ,
Up and down , up and down , I will lead them up and down .
Tell me , and dally not : where is the money ?
You would say so , master , if your garments were thin .
Why , how now , Kate !
Benedick , didst thou note the daughter of Signior Leonato ?
Heaven make thee free of it .
Ay , but I know , What dost thou know ?
Thither must I , and here I leave you , sir .
Naked in bed , Iago , and not mean harm !
Doth not the gentleman Deserve as full as fortunate a bed As ever Beatrice shall couch upon ?
Wherefore storm you so ?
Am I like such a fellow ?
Be aidant and remediate In the good man's distress .
What misadventure is so early up That calls our person from our morning rest ?
Tush , I will stir about , And all things shall be well , I warrant thee , wife .
As mine eyes opened , I saw their weapons drawn .
Within these three days let me hear thee say That Cassio's not alive .
That's as we list to grace him .
Dismiss me ?
The Prince of Arragon hath ta'en his oath And comes to his election presently .
Do not approach Till thou dost hear me call .
I never can see him but I am heartburned an hour after .
Soundly , my lord .
Did your letters pierce the queen to any demonstration of grief ?
Why , may one ask ?
What , no more ?
Then 'tis most like The sovereignty will fall upon Macbeth .
Art rich ?
For what , I pray thee ?
It was great ignorance , Gloucester's eyes being out , To let him live .
By my count , I was your mother much upon these years That you are now a maid .
Bring them before us .
Pronounce it for me , sir , to all our friends , For my heart speaks they are welcome .
Though Nature hath given us wit to flout at Fortune , hath not Fortune sent in this fool to cut off the argument ?
Those that are married already , all but one , shall live .
My deeds upon my head .
In saying so , you shall but say the truth .
What cursed foot wanders this way tonight To cross my obsequies and true love's rite ?
This to be true I do engage my life .
Tis but one cast away , and so , come , death .
Nay , hear him .
Hold , sir , for God's sake !
Is not your husband mad ?
I'll drink for you .
Indeed ?
Why , I will see thee at Philippi , then .
You are in the right .
You mistake , sir , you mistake , sir .
Exclaim no more against it .
Hold you content .
We may as bootless spend our vain command Upon th ' enraged soldiers in their spoil As send precepts to the Leviathan To come ashore .
Happily met , the happier for thy son .
Wake when some vile thing is near .
A great suspicion .
What noise is that ?
There is the playhouse now , there must you sit , And thence to France shall we convey you safe And bring you back , charming the narrow seas To give you gentle pass ; for , if we may , We'll not offend one stomach with our play .
You have not seen such a thing as 'tis .
Thou hast taken against me a most just exception , but yet I protest I have dealt most directly in thy affair .
My hour is almost come When I to sulfurous and tormenting flames Must render up myself .
As if that name , Shot from the deadly level of a gun , Did murder her , as that name's cursed hand Murdered her kinsman .
But leave it all to God .
Madam !
O happy horse , to bear the weight of Antony !
When all's done , You look but on a stool .
Sir , there she stands .
What foul play had we that we came from thence ?
Nay , let them go , a couple of quiet ones .
Dispute it like a man .
So to them both .
Here's the manner of 't : I' th' marketplace , on a tribunal silvered , Cleopatra and himself in chairs of gold Were publicly enthroned .
Villainous whore !
A surgeon !
Have you the lion's part written ?
I know , sir , I am no flatterer .
My books and instruments shall be my company , On them to look and practice by myself .
My tale provokes that question .
What three things does drink especially provoke ?
Zounds , I'll entreat no more .
May she give that ?
Arms , take your last embrace .
Therefore love moderately .
And , for thou wast a spirit too delicate To act her earthy and abhorred commands , Refusing her grand hests , she did confine thee , By help of her more potent ministers And in her most unmitigable rage , Into a cloven pine , within which rift Imprisoned thou didst painfully remain A dozen years ; within which space she died And left thee there , where thou didst vent thy groans As fast as mill wheels strike .
Amen , amen .
Who knocks so hard ?
I do not know what "poetical" is .
What say you ?
Run one before And let the Queen know of our gests .
Your serpent of Egypt is bred now of your mud by the operation of your sun .
You are not ignorant of what excellence Laertes is ,
Though that the queen on special cause is here , Her army is moved on .
Cheerly , good Adam .
Heavens shield Lysander if they mean a fray !
Music , hark .
It is meat and drink to me to see a clown .
Till noon ?
I loved him , friend , No father his son dearer .
Eternity was in our lips and eyes , Bliss in our brows' bent , none our parts so poor But was a race of heaven .
If he be absent , bring his brother to me .
Now near enough .
I see the business .
Why , sir , what's your conceit in that ?
Stand !
What , dost thou scorn me for my gentle counsel , And soothe the devil that I warn thee from ?
And in good time here comes the sweating lord .
Lady , you come hither to be married to this count ?
Oh that I knew this husband , which , you say , must charge his horns with garlands !
Do you see , gentlemen ?
That's very true , my lord .
Yet am I noble as the adversary I come to cope withal .
Where is your husband ?
If any such there be , heaven pardon him !
He dreams .
While that the armed hand doth fight abroad , Th ' advised head defends itself at home .
Their great guilt , Like poison given to work a great time after , Now 'gins to bite the spirits .
Her vine , the merry cheerer of the heart , Unpruned , dies .
I pray you , sir , what is he ?
Let me but meet you ladies one hour hence , And I'll salute your Grace of York as mother And reverend looker-on , of two fair queens .
Good Master Peaseblossom , I shall desire you of more acquaintance too. , Your name , I beseech you , sir ?
Farewell , kind Charmian .
Well , what is it ?
If you will take a homely man's advice , Be not found here .
It was two ere I left him , and now the clock strikes one .
None but the fool , who labors to outjest His heart-struck injuries .
Call !
Sir , I do know you , And dare upon the warrant of my note Commend a dear thing to you .
What a blow was there given !
By a name I know not how to tell thee who I am .
I arrest thee of high treason , by the name of Thomas Grey , knight , of Northumberland .
An if they live , I hope I need not fear .
I know you what you are , And like a sister am most loath to call Your faults as they are named .
My duty hushes me .
I am glad thou canst speak no better English , for if thou couldst , thou wouldst find me such a plain king that thou wouldst think I had sold my farm to buy my crown .
Your overkindness doth wring tears from me .
Now , were not I a little pot and soon hot , my very lips might freeze to my teeth , my tongue to the roof of my mouth , my heart in my belly , ere I should come by a fire to thaw me .
The English force , so please you .
My lord , upon the platform where we watch .
My lord ?
Our reasons are so full of good regard That were you , Antony , the son of Caesar , You should be satisfied .
What should the wars do with these jigging fools ?
Strato , thou hast been all this while asleep .
Is this true ?
What wouldst thou with us ?
She sent for you by Dromio home to dinner .
What dost you mean by this ?
Mark how he trembles in his ecstasy .
Who hath sent thee now ?
When you take occasions to see leeks hereafter , I pray you , mock at 'em , that is all .
What ?
Burn but his books .
But soft , behold !
Wilt thou go to bed , Malvolio ?
In weightier things you'll say a beggar nay .
Here he comes with your niece .
To fetch her fan , her gloves , her mask , nor nothing ?
Within my sword's length set him ; if he 'scape , Heaven forgive him too .
Why looks your grace so heavily today ?
How shall I know thee again ?
I hear the news , my lord .
It shall do well .
There is a fair behavior in thee , captain , And though that nature with a beauteous wall Doth oft close in pollution , yet of thee I will believe thou hast a mind that suits With this thy fair and outward character .
And there is a forerunner come from a fifth , the Prince of Morocco , who brings word the prince his master will be here tonight .
And how doth she ?
If thou hast nature in thee , bear it not .
The slip , sir , the slip .
For two , and sound ones too .
Remember thee !
Ay , you would beg , Were you in my distress .
For so thou art .
I shall the effect of this good lesson keep As watchman to my heart .
Tell me your mind .
I am given , sir , secretly to understand that your younger brother Orlando hath a disposition to come in disguised against me to try a fall .
Why , what an intricate impeach is this !
That's not so good now .
What love could press Lysander from my side ?
What you would have I'll stay to know at your abandoned cave .
And I will purge thy mortal grossness so That thou shalt like an airy spirit go. , Peaseblossom , Cobweb , Moth , and Mustardseed !
Thy smiles become thee well .
It is a poison tempered by himself .
Belong you to the Lady Olivia , friends ?
Therefore , you clown , abandon , which is , in the vulgar , "leave" , the society , which in the boorish is "company" , of this female , which in the common is "woman" ; which together is , abandon the society of this female , or , clown , thou perishest ; or , to thy better understanding , diest ; or , to wit , I kill thee , make thee away , translate thy life into death , thy liberty into bondage .
He is welcome hither .
Wherefore do you come ?
O thou foul thief , where hast thou stowed my daughter ?
There's my cap .
I should not urge thy duty past thy might .
Mark Antony shall say I am not well , And for thy humor I will stay at home .
The blow thou hadst Shall make thy peace for moving me to rage , And I will boot thee with what gift beside Thy modesty can beg .
I am boy to them all three , but all they three , though they would serve me , could not be man to me .
Horns ?
All men's faces are true , whatsome'er their hands are .
You must contrary me .
The honorable lady of the house , which is she ?
Oh , you are sick of self-love , Malvolio , and taste with a distempered appetite .
Zounds , who is there ?
Good madam .
Come , sir , I will not let you go .
Let me wipe it first .
Besides , I have some business in the town .
You take pleasure then in the message ?
Therefore , great King , We yield our town and lives to thy soft mercy .
Wherefore art thou Romeo ?
I'll make him find him .
If you will patiently dance in our round And see our moonlight revels , go with us .
So , Dolabella , It shall content me best .
I will resolve you herein presently .
Do you know what you say ?
Oh , the heavens !
I know him well .
I know he would not be a wolf But that he sees the Romans are but sheep .
I'll find Romeo To comfort you .
Therefore , when he sees reason of fears as we do , his fears , out of doubt , be of the same relish as ours are .
You are thought here to be the most senseless and fit man for the constable of the watch ; therefore bear you the lantern .
You have forgot the will I told you of .
When shall he come ?
I pray you , choose another subject .
Now , where's your master ?
It is too true an evil .
Madam , there is at the gate a young gentleman much desires to speak with you .
Nay , by 'r Lady , that I think he can not .
Ay .
Let's draw our weapons .
Well , what was yours ?
Alack , I love myself .
Woo't fast ?
Farewell .
Thy mother was a piece of virtue and She said thou wast my daughter .
Soon at five o'clock , Please you , I'll meet with you upon the mart And afterward consort you till bedtime .
That love i begged for you he begged of me .
What do you mean ?
Now lies he there , And none so poor to do him reverence .
As I did sleep under this yew tree here , I dreamt my master and another fought , And that my master slew him .
Let our catch be "Thou Knave." "Hold thy peace , thou knave , " knight ?
Have at the very eye of that proverb with "A pox of the devil." You are the better at proverbs , by how much "A fool's bolt is soon shot." You have shot over .
My Lady Grey his wife , Clarence , 'tis she That tempers him to this extremity .
Hear me for my cause , and be silent that you may hear .
Nay , it is .
You should be ruled and led By some discretion that discerns your state Better than you yourself .
Here comes your father .
Bring me no more reports .
My niece Plantagenet Led in the hand of her kind aunt of Gloucester ?
May 't please your Majesty to give us leave Freely to render what we have in charge , Or shall we sparingly show you far off The Dauphin's meaning and our embassy ?
Then show it me .
Look , how she rubs her hands .
My lord , he's going to his mother's closet .
Most gracious Duke , To my unfolding lend your prosperous ear And let me find a charter in your voice , T ' assist my simpleness .
Therefore I have entreated him along With us to watch the minutes of this night , That if again this apparition come He may approve our eyes and speak to it .
Till I shall see you in your soldiers' dress , Which will become you both , farewell .
Well , keep me company but two years more , Thou shalt not know the sound of thine own tongue .
I find not Myself disposed to sleep .
Would I were so too .
A fair name .
Thou stickest a dagger in me .
Utter my thoughts ?
He's of the color of the nutmeg .
That way the noise is .
Tis my picture .
I think you set nothing by a bloody coxcomb .
The king , His brother , and yours , abide all three distracted , And the remainder mourning over them , Brimful of sorrow and dismay .
I'll not fight with thee .
Ah , Luciana , did he tempt thee so ?
I'll fetch them , sir .
The wager ?
Hie thee , gentle Jew .
When , without stratagem , But in plain shock and even play of battle , Was ever known so great and little loss On one part and on th ' other ?
Fed with the same food , hurt with the same weapons , subject to the same diseases , healed by the same means , warmed and cooled by the same winter and summer as a Christian is ?
Why , horns , which such as you are fain to be beholding to your wives for .
The king has killed his heart .
Go , get thee gone , I say .
Victory sits on our helms .
He says his name's Poor Tom .
Twas yet some comfort When misery could beguile the tyrant's rage And frustrate his proud will .
Nay , come , I pray you , sir , give me the chain .
I have more cause .
What kind of god art thou , that suffer'st more Of mortal griefs than do thy worshippers ?
Soft , no haste .
You'll ask me why I rather choose to have A weight of carrion flesh than to receive Three thousand ducats .
Ay , and a subtle , as he most learnedly delivered .
Myself ?
Know'st thou not any whom corrupting gold Will tempt unto a close exploit of death ?
His glory not extenuated wherein he was worthy , nor his offenses enforced for which he suffered death .
Why , here is the note of the fashion to testify .
Though their injunction be to bar my doors And let this tyrannous night take hold upon you , Yet have I ventured to come seek you out And bring you where both fire and food is ready .
I knew you at the first You were a moveable .
Does't not go well ?
O , he was gentle , mild , and virtuous .
Of what personage and years is he ?
I dare swear this is the right Vincentio .
Old I do wax , and from my weary limbs Honor is cudgeled .
I'll show thee the best springs .
Would it be better , madam , than I am ?
Make me to see 't , or at the least so prove it That the probation bear no hinge nor loop To hang a doubt on , or woe upon thy life !
No , truly .
By my troth , he'll yield the crow a pudding one of these days .
You lie .
Sit i ' th ' middle .
Ah , but I think him better than I say , And yet would herein others ' eyes were worse .
But if I give my wife a handkerchief , What then ?
Sir , sooth to say , you did not dine at home .
Draw , you rascal .
Assist , good friends .
The devil damn thee black , thou cream-faced loon !
How vexest thou this man !
I'll warrant she'll tax him home .
Caesar is touched .
Ay , 'tis strong , and it does indifferent well in a dun-colored stock .
I must tell you then .
Fie , sir , fie !
My lord is not my lord , nor should I know him Were he in favor as in humor altered .
So be it .
Help me , my women !
Never talk to me .
Ay , madam .
Thus far can I praise him : he is of a noble strain , of approved valor , and confirmed honesty .
Hortensio , to what end are all these words ?
Would I were satisfied !
Yes , 'tis Emilia. , 'T is like she comes to speak of Cassio's death , The noise was high .
Yet is this no charm for the toothache. , Old Signior , walk aside with me .
If they do see thee they will murder thee .
I had my father's signet in my purse , Which was the model of that Danish seal .
To be your fellow You may deny me , but I'll be your servant Whether you will or no .
And thou , all-shaking thunder , Smite flat the thick rotundity o ' th ' world , Crack nature's molds , all germens spill at once That make ingrateful man !
But If thou dost break her virgin knot before All sanctimonious ceremonies may With full and holy rite be ministered , No sweet aspersion shall the heavens let fall To make this contract grow , but barren hate , Sour-eyed disdain , and discord shall bestrew The union of your bed with weeds so loathly That you shall hate it both .
No , faith , lords and great men will not let me .
What art thou that dost grumble there i ' th ' straw ?
Very well , madam .
Truly , shepherd , in respect of itself , it is a good life ; but in respect that it is a shepherd's life , it is naught .
But by sea he is an absolute master .
Is it his use ?
Trust me , I am glad on 't .
But if you do refuse to marry me , You'll give yourself to this most faithful shepherd ?
Here is a wonder , if you talk of a wonder .
Can you not stay awhile ?
My more particular , And that which most with you should safe my going , Is Fulvia's death .
Let him alone , for I remember now How he's employed .
No , I will be the pattern of all patience .
I pray you and beseech you that you will .
Four nights will quickly dream away the time .
Tis paltry to be Caesar .
Why is my lord enraged against his love ?

Merciful powers , Restrain in me the cursed thoughts that nature Gives way to in repose .
What art thou ?
This is called "the countercheck quarrelsome , " and so to "the lie circumstantial" and "the lie direct." And how oft did you say his beard was not well cut ?

Can you blame her then , being a maid yet rosed over with the virgin crimson of modesty , if she deny the appearance of a naked blind boy in her naked seeing self ?
I pray you , will you take him by the arm ?
What passion hangs these weights upon my tongue ?
Does he rave ?
I hope she will be brief .
How far that little candle throws his beams !
When was it she last walked ?
Six or seven thousand is their utmost power .
Faith , I know not what to say .

That Herod's head I'll have !
She hath prevented me .
If sanctimony and a frail vow betwixt an erring barbarian and supersubtle Venetian be not too hard for my wits and all the tribe of hell , thou shalt enjoy her .
Ha !
Two things are to be done : My wife must move for Cassio to her mistress .
The king would speak with Cornwall .
That may be , for you bear a many superfluously , and 'twere more honor some were away .
I thought thou hadst been resolute .
What bloody man is that ?
Faith , e'en with losing his wits .
Twas no need , I trow , To bid me trudge .
It struck mine ear most terribly .
Now , Signior , what news ?
I know it is the moon .
Have all his ventures failed ?
Yare , yare , good Iras , quick .
She will sit you , you heard my daughter tell you how .
Does she so ?
I hear him .
Of what your reverence shall incite us to .

Would Katherine had never seen him , though !
Know'st thou Gower ?
Were you by when it began ?
What's he that now is going out of door ?
How now , interjections ?
Why Romeo , art thou mad ?
Brutus and Caesar , what should be in that "Caesar" ?
But I will write again to Mantua , And keep her at my cell till Romeo come .
No harm .

It is the east , and Juliet is the sun .
Oh , in this love , you love your child so ill That you run mad , seeing that she is well .

So do not I .
Come hither , sir .
In this slumbery agitation , besides her walking and other actual performances , what , at any time , have you heard her say ?
I think I had .
Who's there ?
I dare pawn down my life for him that he hath wrote this to feel my affection to your honor and to no other pretense of danger .
Hover about her ; say that right for right Hath dimmed your infant morn to aged night .
Well , God give them wisdom that have it .
Very well .

Why , sir , cobble you .
Why , then 'tis time to arm and give direction .

Kiss him for that , good widow .
I gave him the stuff .
Take comfort .
No , my lord .
Thou art a lady .
God has given you one face and you make yourselves another .
Full half an hour .
But well and free , If thou so yield him , there is gold , and here My bluest veins to kiss , a hand that kings Have lipped , and trembled kissing .
Tell him , so please him come unto this place , He shall be satisfied and , by my honor , Depart untouched .
Of lusty earls : Grandpre and Roussi , Faulconbridge and Foix , Beaumont and Marle , Vaudemont and Lestrale .
Let grief Convert to anger .
Is it your dear friend that is thus in trouble ?
Do they hold the same estimation they did when I was in the city ?
Call them forth .
Peaseblossom .
Go , rascals , go , and fetch my supper in .
O perdurable shame !
Amaze the welkin with your broken staves ,
Far more , far more , to you do I decline .
Now in faith , Gratiano , You give your wife too unkind a cause of grief .
I will dispatch it straight .
Mistress and master , you have oft inquired After the shepherd that complained of love , Who you saw sitting by me on the turf , Praising the proud disdainful shepherdess That was his mistress .
Good morrow , masters .

Your husband being troubled with a shrew Measures my husband's sorrow by his woe .

I ne'er saw this before .
Therefore prepare thyself .

What is 't you seek ?
Why , that is nothing .
Now , if you love me , stay .
Thank God." A good answer .
With all my heart I'll gossip at this feast .
Canst thou blame him ?
Doth not Brutus bootless kneel ?
I might have saved her .
I rather choose To wrong the dead , to wrong myself and you , Than I will wrong such honorable men .
My lord ?
Ha !
Before and apace .
Oh , the good gods !
He's fat , and scant of breath. , Here , Hamlet , take my napkin , rub thy brows .
No , my fair cousin .
O villainy !
Very foul .
I thought all for the best .
O bosom black as death !
Had he done so ?
Set it by a while .

And what's the news , good cousin Lodovico ?
You bid me make it orderly and well , According to the fashion and the time .

Who comes here ?

How now , my sweet Bianca !
Good night , honest Iago .
Then stand with us .
Which of you , if you were a prince's son Being pent from liberty , as I am now , If two such murderers as yourselves came to you , Would not entreat for life ?
Nay , but swear 't .
Now all labor Mars what it does .
By what ?
Regan , I think you are .
Therefore bear up and board 'em. , Servant- monster , drink to me .
Two thousand ducats by the year of land !
Though I am mad , I will not bite him .
Why , that same pale hard-hearted wench , that Rosaline , Torments him so , that he will sure run mad .

Monster , come , put some lime upon your fingers , and away with the rest .
No , as I am a Christian .
If you swear , my lord , you shall not be forsworn .
Look in the almanac .
We pray you for your own sake to embrace your own safety and give over this attempt .

The Moor himself at sea And is in full commission here for Cyprus .
Go to , farewell .
Give me my robe .
Some god direct my judgment !
The air breathes upon us here most sweetly .
He is not lolling on a lewd love bed , But on his knees at meditation ; Not dallying with a brace of courtesans , But meditating with two deep divines ; Not sleeping , to engross his idle body , But praying , to enrich his watchful soul .
Change you color ?
O Clitus !
I'll fight at sea .
Good people , enter and lay hold on him .
You dare easier be friends with me than fight with mine enemy .
Wrong not her birth .
I do obey thee till I give thee bail .
Would you not swear , All you that see her , that she were a maid By these exterior shows ?
It is not very strange .
Octavius , I have seen more days than you .
Now art thou Romeo .
Thus from my lips , by thine , my sin is purged .
There , my blessing with thee .
This feather stirs .
But is all this for your father ?

Demand .
As he shall smile , Othello shall go mad .
Ay , good fool .
Such as she says my lord did say I was .

And so I shall catch the fly , your cousin , in the latter end and she must be blind too .
Ay , those attires are best .
My lord ?
Here comes the king , The queen , the courtiers , who is this they follow , And with such maimed rites ?

Of thirty sail .
Yet you began rudely .
Some light-foot friend post to the duke of Norfolk , Ratcliffe , thyself , or Catesby .

If it be man's work , I'll do 't .
Romans , countrymen , and lovers !
Therefore to our best mercy give yourselves Or , like to men proud of destruction , Defy us to our worst .
Not a false gallop .
This was looked for at your hand , and this was balked .
This is the night That either makes me or fordoes me quite .
Marry , will I , sir .
Happily he's the second time come to them , for they say an old man is twice a child .
Ha , ha , ha !
All things are ready if our minds be so .
Let him speak , my lord , Upon his peril , that I have reserved To myself nothing .
You were to blame , I must be plain with you , To part so slightly with your wife's first gift , A thing stuck on with oaths upon your finger And so riveted with faith unto your flesh .
Master , I am here entered in bond for you .
My Lord , Ay , what's o'clock ?
O sweet bully Bottom !
If you will come to me , For now I spy a danger , I entreat you To bring but five and twenty .
You are merry , my lord .

One word , sir .

My being in Egypt , Caesar , what was 't to you ?
Good Maria , let this fellow be looked to .
Has he , masters ?
Do but look up .
It should be , But he is drowned , and these are devils .
He is very near by this .
He , for his father's sake , so loves the prince That he will not be won to aught against him .
Therefore weep .
No , that you shall not till you take her hand Before this friar and swear to marry her .
The advancement of your children , gentle lady .
If he do blench , I know my course .
Fie , what a question's that If thou wert near a lewd interpreter !
I have not seen such a firago .
Twill endure wind and weather .
You have been factious one against the other. , Wife , love Lord Hastings .
I would have thought her spirit had been invincible against all assaults of affection .
God pardon them that are the cause thereof .
Thou teachest me .
Whether this be Or be not , I'll not swear .
And hath given countenance to his speech , my lord , With almost all the holy vows of heaven .
If it be you that stir these daughters ' hearts Against their father , fool me not so much To bear it tamely .
Hail .
What make you from home ?
I loved you not .
Tell me , that I may sack The hateful mansion .
Marry , my uncle Clarence ' angry ghost .
Give me those flowers .
So the gods keep you And make the hearts of Romans serve your ends .
Sweet friends , to bed .
I meant plain holy thistle .
Fie , now you run this humor out of breath .
Oh , he is gone indeed .
Prithee , see there !
Dost thou forget From what a torment I did free thee ?
If they make you not then the better answer , you may say they are not the men you took them for .
To the death , my lord .
Let it be who it is .
Where did you leave him ?
Thou know'st we work by wit and not by witchcraft , And wit depends on dilatory time .
I dare assure thee that no enemy Shall ever take alive the noble Brutus .
Oh !
Why , that's all one .
What hath quenched them hath given me fire .
The man is innocent .
What said he ?
With Rosaline , my ghostly Father ?
This done , he took the bride about the neck And kissed her lips with such a clamorous smack That at the parting all the church did echo .
In me 'tis villainy , In thee 't had been good service .
But here comes Antony .
How far'st thou , soldier ?
Sister , you'll go with us ?
What proof shall I make of that ?
The king rises .
Go , Lovell , with all speed to Doctor Shaw .
And this .
They stumble that run fast .
I am qualmish at the smell of leek .
So thou mayst say the king lies by a beggar if a beggar dwell near him , or the church stands by thy tabor , if thy tabor stand by the church .
Nay , come , again .
I'll rather dwell in my necessity .
But I hope you have no intent to turn husband , have you ?
The king himself is rode to view their battle .
Your betters , sir .
Throw my heart Against the flint and hardness of my fault , Which , being dried with grief , will break to powder And finish all foul thoughts .
More validity , More honorable state , more courtship lives In carrion flies than Romeo .
Alas , too soon We came aboard .
I looked her in the face , and saw her led Between her brother and Mark Antony .
Ay , but not enough .
Experience , manhood , honor , ne'er before Did violate so itself .
Go thrust him out at gates , and let him smell His way to Dover .
See how she leans her cheek upon her hand .
Whose house ?
A messenger from the galleys .
I do assure thee , father , so it is .
The most infectious pestilence upon thee !
Look to your house , your daughter , and your bags !
What villain touched his body , that did stab , And not for justice ?
Madam , here comes my lord .
Yet Brutus says he was ambitious , And Brutus is an honorable man .
I must catechise you for it , madonna .
Wouldst thou give 'em all ?
Some haste , my lord !
Truly , I think they are .
Make me not offended In your distrust .
It is a paltry cap , A custard-coffin , a bauble , a silken pie .
I find you passing gentle .
Ascend her chamber , hence , and comfort her .
He meant he did me none ; the more my spite .
His eyes are humbler than they used to be .
Keep your word , Silvius , that you'll marry her If she refuse me .
O Cicero , I have seen tempests when the scolding winds Have rived the knotty oaks , and I have seen Th ' ambitious ocean swell and rage and foam To be exalted with the threatening clouds , But never till tonight , never till now , Did I go through a tempest dropping fire .
Saw'st thou him enter at the abbey here ?
By my troth , I speak my thought .
Sir , he's rash and very sudden in choler , and haply may strike at you .
Your honor calls you hence .
The gods confound thee !
Here he comes .
I would fain learn to lie .
Who talks of my nation ?
She is protectress of her honor too .
I pray you bring me on the way a little And say if I shall see you soon at night .
In love ?
Tis good .
What's your highness' pleasure ?
Uncharitably with me have you dealt , And shamefully my hopes by you are butchered .
Neither good nor bad .
You wrong me , Brutus .
Hear me , for I will speak .
Ay , and Wall too .
Let 't be so , good Corporal Nym .
Now , as I am a Christian , answer me In what safe place you have bestowed my money , Or I shall break that merry sconce of yours That stands on tricks when I am undisposed .
I have drunk poison whiles he uttered it .
How fearful And dizzy 'tis to cast one's eyes so low !
Be near me , that I may remember you .
Here , Signior Tranio , This bird you aimed at , though you hit her not. , Therefore a health to all that shot and missed .
My Regan counsels well .
O noble English , that could entertain With half their forces the full pride of France And let another half stand laughing by , All out of work and cold for action !
My Lord of Cambridge , and my kind Lord of Masham , And you , my gentle knight , give me your thoughts .
I myself could make A chough of as deep chat .
They do offend our sight .
O momentary grace of mortal men , Which we more hunt for than the grace of God !
But note me , signor ,
Or does he walk ?
Ay , sir ; there are a crew of wretched souls That stay his cure .
Go , bid the huntsmen wake them with their horns .
But for his purpose in the coronation , I have not sounded him , nor he delivered His gracious pleasure any way therein .
Who , I , my lord ?
My husband is on earth , my faith in heaven .
Now go to the door and stay there till we call .
Upon the king !
Sure , these are but imaginary wiles , And lapland sorcerers inhabit here .
They say Edgar , his banished son , is with the Earl of Kent in Germany .
Mine eyes do itch , Doth that bode weeping ?
He's in his fit now and does not talk after the wisest .
Tis sweating labor To bear such idleness so near the heart As Cleopatra this .
O knight , thou lackest a cup of canary .
One word more Shall make me chide thee , if not hate thee .
Say'st me so , friend ?
Cassio's a proper man .
Who's there ?
For do but stand upon the foaming shore , The chidden billow seems to pelt the clouds , The wind-shaked surge , with high and monstrous mane , Seems to cast water on the burning bear , And quench the guards of th ' ever-fixed pole .
Be not ta'en tardy by unwise delay .
On me , whose all not equals Edward's moiety ?
Oh , farewell !
Come on , gentle my lord , Sleek o'er your rugged looks .
That is the voice , Or I am much deceived , of Portia .
How say you , then ?
Why , he's a devil , a devil , a very fiend .
Then half Signor Benedick's tongue in Count John's mouth , and half Count John's melancholy in Signor Benedick's face , With a good leg and a good foot , uncle , and money enough in his purse , such a man would win any woman in the world , if he could get her goodwill .
I do not like the Tower , of any place. , Did Julius Caesar build that place , my lord ?
I confess the cape .
Name the day of marriage , and God give thee joy .
Is 't gone ?
All three of them are desperate .
You , cousin .
Out , alas !
What will I do , think'st thou ?
Oh , heavy ignorance !
My gracious sovereign .
The world affords no law to make thee rich .
Where is the beauteous majesty of Denmark ?
Ay , boy .
That if you be honest and fair , your honesty should admit no discourse to your beauty .
No .
I pray , sir , can you read ?
Speak once again .
I humbly thank your ladyship .
Supper is done , and we shall come too late .
What is it ?
Come , no matter vor your foins .
I tell you , 'twill sound harshly in her ears .
If I had thee in Lipsbury pinfold , I would make thee care for me .
By heaven , it is the same I gave the doctor !
Will you go , coz ?
Ah , where's my man ? , Give me some aqua vitae. , These griefs , these woes , these sorrows make me old .
I will not come .
A sick man in sadness makes his will , A word ill urged to one that is so ill .
Let's talk .
Look how he makes to Caesar .
If one should be a prey , how much the better To fall before the lion than the wolf !
Uncle !
And look to have it yielded with all kindness .
Good sir , be a man , Think every bearded fellow that's but yoked May draw with you .
Wonder not Nor be grieved .
What do you mean , my lord ?
Well , more anon. , Comes the king forth , I pray you ?
Now , soldiers , march away , And how Thou pleasest , God , dispose the day .
I will go on the slightest errand now to the Antipodes that you can devise to send me on .
I'll board him presently .
What is the news ?
Be better at thy leisure .
Away with the dotard !
With him I sent the queen , My reason all the same , and they are ready Tomorrow or at further space t ' appear Where you shall hold your session .
Hence , horrible shadow !
Nay , how will you do for a husband ?
For I am sick when I do look on thee .
If not , adieu .
What good is covered with the face of heaven , To be discovered , that can do me good ?
Look to 't , I charge you .
As wicked dew as e'er my mother brushed With raven's feather from unwholesome fen Drop on you both !
Bottom !
No further , sir .
Tell him , when that our princely father York Blessed his three sons with his victorious arm , He little thought of this divided friendship .
These are the forgeries of jealousy .
My old friend Grumio and my good friend Petruchio ?
No money , on my faith , but the gleek .
Heard you this , Gonzalo ?
If I did take the kingdom from your sons , To make amends I'll give it to your daughter .
Our fortune lies Upon this jump .
Ah , welladay !
Were we before our armies , and to fight , I should do thus .
Why , how now , Adam ?
For Oberon is passing fell and wrath Because that she , as her attendant hath A lovely boy stolen from an Indian king .
Now , if thou wert a poet , I might have some hope thou didst feign .
Peter , stay at the gate .
Sailors , my lord , they say .
What do you think Of marching to Philippi presently ?
Impudent strumpet !
Twice did he turn his back and purposed so , But kindness , nobler ever than revenge , And nature , stronger than his just occasion , Made him give battle to the lioness , Who quickly fell before him ; in which hurtling , From miserable slumber I awaked .
Would you desire lime and hair to speak better ?
The children thus disposed , my wife and I , Fixing our eyes on whom our care was fixed , Fastened ourselves at either end the mast And , floating straight , obedient to the stream , Was carried towards Corinth , as we thought .
I pray thee , hold thy peace .
Well met , my lord .
Alas , poor shepherd , searching of thy wound , I have by hard adventure found mine own .
Beat ,
Know you any , count ?
Ingratitude , thou marble-hearted fiend , More hideous when thou show'st thee in a child Than the sea monster .
The greatest note of it is his melancholy .
Ah , my good lord , what have I seen tonight !
Retire we to our chamber .
He sups tonight with a harlotry , and thither will I go to him .
Go thither , and with unattainted eye Compare her face with some that I shall show , And I will make thee think thy swan a crow .
Tis time that I were gone .
Give you good morrow .
Good lords , make all the speedy haste you may .
Come on , come on .
Therefore thou sleep'st so sound .
Thy slander hath gone through and through her heart , And she lies buried with her ancestors , Oh , in a tomb where never scandal slept Save this of hers , framed by thy villainy .
Dear lady , welcome home .
What man dost thou dig it for ?
Here , madam .
Richard !
Fie , that you'll say so !
The royal tree hath left us royal fruit , Which , mellowed by the stealing hours of time , Will well become the seat of majesty , And make , no doubt , us happy by his reign .
You must have patience , madam .
I have not dined today .
Madam , sleeps still .
Hear me , good friends ,
Why , there was a crown offered him ; and , being offered him , he put it by with the back of his hand , thus ; and then the people fell a-shouting .
If then that friend demand why Brutus rose against Caesar , this is my answer : not that I loved Caesar less , but that I loved Rome more .
Now is it time to arm .
Indeed , I should have asked thee that before .
Say that I lingered with you at your shop To see the making of her carcanet , And that tomorrow you will bring it home .
Therefore the sadness is without limit .
Speak you so gently ?
No , not for Venice .
I do I know not what and fear to find Mine eye too great a flatterer for my mind .
Thou thinkest I am in sport .
What follows , then , my lord ?
I will play the swan .
Blind is his love and best befits the dark .
Nay , send in time !
But it sufficeth that the day will end , And then the end is known. , Come , ho !
Farewell .
Oh , that my prayers could such affection move !
No , monster , not I .
An abominable monster !
Ay , and this .
And what confederacy have you with the traitors Late footed in the kingdom ?
This weaves itself perforce into my business .
So let him land , And solemnly see him set on to London .
What , will my daughter prove a good musician ?
I'll have grounds More relative than this .
Up .
Thou shalt buy this dear If ever I thy face by daylight see .
Like aqua vitae with a midwife .
What's he that wishes so ?
It is very hot .
I pray you , give me leave to go from hence .
He does well to commend it himself .
Or docks , or mallows .
You are my true and honorable wife , As dear to me as are the ruddy drops That visit my sad heart .
Although I hate her , I'll not harm her so .
Under what title shall I woo for thee , That God , the law , my honor and her love Can make seem pleasing to her tender years ?
He only lived but till he was a man , The which no sooner had his prowess confirmed In the unshrinking station where he fought , But like a man he died .
Ay , now am I in Arden , the more fool I .
Quite dumb ?
But , by 'r Lady , he must build churches then , or else shall he suffer not thinking on , with the hobby-horse , whose epitaph is "For , oh , for , oh , the hobby-horse is forgot." What means this , my lord ?
What is he that you ask for , niece ?
Thou art a fool .
And why , my Lady Wisdom ?
If you be well pleased with this And hold your fortune for your bliss , Turn you where your lady is And claim her with a loving kiss."
God save you , sir .
Are you wise ?
No , uncle , I'll none .
And that I am he Let me a little show it even in this : That I was constant Cimber should be banished , And constant do remain to keep him so .
With this , my lord , myself have naught to do .
Where is thy master , Dromio ?
It is now high suppertime , and the night grows to waste .
Was not Count John here at supper ?
To one of your receiving Enough is shown .
Hadst thou no poison mixed , no sharp-ground knife , No sudden mean of death , though ne'er so mean , But "banished" to kill me ? , "Banished" !
Weeping and wailing over Tybalt's corse .
Know'st thou the way to Dover ?
O day and night , but this is wondrous strange !
But I know to be up late is to be up late .
My noble father , I do perceive here a divided duty .
Less in your knowledge and your grace you show not Than our earth's wonder , more than earth divine .
Stay but a little .
Ay , on mine honor .
I have it , Tranio !
Where is our usual manager of mirth ?
Darkness and devils !
And how cam'st thou hither ?
Let him alone awhile .
Thence we looked toward England And cited up a thousand fearful times , During the wars of York and Lancaster That had befall'n us .
Use me but as your spaniel , spurn me , strike me , Neglect me , lose me .
Now he begins the story .
And tell me now , sweet friend , what happy gale Blows you to Padua here from old Verona ?
Peace , peace , Iras .
The even mead , that erst brought sweetly forth The freckled cowslip , burnet , and green clover , Wanting the scythe , withal uncorrected , rank , Conceives by idleness , and nothing teems But hateful docks , rough thistles , kecksies , burrs , Losing both beauty and utility .
No , pray thee .
Then he is dead ?
Go , And with your speediest bring us what she says And how you find of her .
Cupid is a knavish lad Thus to make poor females mad .
Sir , I have not you by the hand .
Three thousand ducats , well .
Your grace hath laid the odds o ' th ' weaker side .
Enough , Captain .
Master , is this Mistress Satan ?
What have you done ?
Will 't please your highness walk ?
In such a night as this , When the sweet wind did gently kiss the trees And they did make no noise , in such a night Troilus methinks mounted the Trojan walls And sighed his soul toward the Grecian tents Where Cressid lay that night .
Be better suited .
You speak not as you think .
No , by this hand .
Thus we are agreed .
Tigers , not daughters , what have you performed ?
In troth , 'tis morning .
But now mine eyes , Which I have darted at thee , hurt thee not .
Not one , my lord .
Myself , he , and my sister Today did dine together .
Tis well , sir , that you hunted for yourself .
Bear me , good friends , where Cleopatra bides .
Modo he's called , and Mahu .
Who is here so base that would be a bondman ?
I can not think you are my son .
The order was reversed .
I do consent , Prick him down , Antony .
Love give me strength , and strength shall help afford .
I would these dewy tears were from the ground .
His taints and honors Waged equal with him .
How dost thou feel thyself now ?
He and Lepidus are at Caesar's house .
All men I hope live so .
Sleep dwell upon thine eyes , peace in thy breast .
Then , good my liege , mistake me not so much To think my poverty is treacherous .
Fare you well .
Farewell !
Well .
My lord , I did , But answer made it none .
So could I , faith , boy , to have the next wish after , That Lucentio indeed had Baptista's youngest daughter .
Make it so known .
Why , I am sure , if he forfeit thou wilt not take his flesh .
Believe me , lord , I think he can not choose .
Has here writ a letter to you .
I'll tell you in your ear .
She is not , madam .
Nay , like enough , for I stay dinner there .
Go not my horse the better , I must become a borrower of the night For a dark hour or twain .
Brother , I'll go and bring it thee .
Well thought on .
That must we also .
If we offend , it is with our good will .
If thus thou vanishest , thou tell'st the world It is not worth leave-taking .
Well , let it be. , What ho , Malvolio !
I am full of pleasure .
Come , wherefore should you be so pashful ?
I shall obey you in all fair commands .
I , madam ?
Is all things ready for the royal time ?
Peace !
strange that sheeps ' guts should hale souls out of men's bodies ?
Is that true ?
Oh , thy vile lady !
Ho , now you strike like the blind man .
Madam , with all my heart .
Amen .
The Lord protect him from that kingly title !
Shall I say to Caesar What you require of him ?
You shall play it in a mask , and you may speak as small as you will .
Either heaven with lightning strike the murderer dead , Or earth gape open wide and eat him quick , As thou dost swallow up this good king's blood , Which his hell-governed arm hath butchered !
Twas I , but 'tis not I. I do not shame To tell you what I was , since my conversion So sweetly tastes , being the thing I am .
Is there any cause in nature that makes these hard hearts ?
Therefore let's follow .
I have locked the letter in my closet .
Give me leave , Caesar .
I speak but brotherly of him , but should I anatomize him to thee as he is , I must blush and weep , and thou must look pale and wonder .
You shall not go , my lord .
I can not blame thee now to weep , For such an injury would vex a very saint , Much more a shrew of thy impatient humor .
Do not , Phoebe .
I dare be sworn for him he would not leave it Nor pluck it from his finger for the wealth That the world masters .
At your request !
Speak to her , Hamlet .
The trumpery in my house , go bring it hither For stale to catch these thieves .
So do our vulgar drench their peasant limbs In blood of princes , and the wounded steeds Fret fetlock deep in gore , and with wild rage Yerk out their armed heels at their dead masters , Killing them twice .
Decius , well urged .
O , reason not the need !
O noble Emperor , do not fight by sea !
Tis strange .
Ay , and he'll tame her .
Hold , my hand .
Thus must I from the smoke into the smother , From tyrant duke unto a tyrant brother .
Cool it with a baboon's blood , Then the charm is firm and good .
I will give him some relief if it be but for that .
I have been up this hour , awake all night .
Yes , one place else , if you will hear me name it .
It is a fault that springeth from your eye .
Bless us !
In bed asleep while they do dream things true .
What noise is that ?
O Regan , wilt thou take her by the hand ?
These time ambles withal .
Go to .
Ay , he was porn at Monmouth , Captain Gower .
I will only be bold with Benedick for his company , for from the crown of his head to the sole of his foot he is all mirth .
That head , my lord ?
Shall we to th ' court ?
All thy tediousness on me , ah ?
It did , it did .
Come hither , good Volumnius .
Verona , for a while I take my leave , To see my friends in Padua , but of all My best beloved and approved friend , Hortensio .
And where's Cordelia ? , Seest thou this object , Kent ?

Normans , but bastard Normans , Norman bastards !
There is a man haunts the forest that abuses our young plants with carving "Rosalind" on their barks , hangs odes upon hawthorns and elegies on brambles , all , forsooth , deifying the name of Rosalind .
Remember who commended thy yellow stockings , " Thy yellow stockings ?
The flat transgression of a schoolboy who , being overjoyed with finding a birds ' nest , shows it his companion , and he steals it .
Have you no modesty , no maiden shame , No touch of bashfulness ?
Tis so .
Old lord , I can not blame thee , Who am myself attached with weariness To th ' dulling of my spirits .
Call him .
Should not upbraid our course .
Or if it did not , Your first is dead , or 'twere as good he were , As living here and you no use of him .
If Caesar had stabbed their mothers they would have done no less .
And so they parted .
I will be satisfied .
Let me alone .
But ere they came , -O , let me say no more !
My father watches .
I'll tell my husband , Launcelot , what you say .
He may recover yet .
There is no other way , Unless thou couldst put on some other shape And not be Richard , that hath done all this .
What's that , my lord ?
He was wont to lend money for a Christian courtesy ; let him look to his bond .
Lie thou there ( throwing down a letter ) , for here comes the trout that must be caught with tickling .
So , adieu .
I'll not be made a soft and dull-eyed fool To shake the head , relent and sigh , and yield To Christian intercessors .
I will physic your rankness and yet give no thousand crowns neither. , Holla , Dennis !
I wonder that you will still be talking , Signor Benedick .
Go to , go to. , Come hither , sir .
I chose her when I could not ask my father For his advice , nor thought I had one .
Be brief , lest that the process of thy kindness Last longer telling than thy kindness ' date .
Come , go with me ; Under our tents I'll play the eavesdropper To see if any mean to shrink from me .
Thou liest , thou shag-haired villain !
By my sword , Beatrice , thou lovest me .
Now , I prithee , daughter , do not make me mad .
And I for no woman .
Oh , I could play the woman with mine eyes And braggart with my tongue !
Hail to thee , thane of Glamis !
And never , since the middle summer's spring , Met we on hill , in dale , forest , or mead , By paved fountain , or by rushy brook , Or in the beached margent of the sea , To dance our ringlets to the whistling wind , But with thy brawls thou hast disturbed our sport .
In thee there is not half an hour of life .
Speak to me what thou art .
Unless the master were the man .
You can not , if my heart were in your hand , Nor shall not , whilst 'tis in my custody .
Before you hazard , for in choosing wrong I lose your company .
Signior Brabantio , ho !
I mean in singing .
A many of our bodies shall no doubt Find native graves , upon the which , I trust , Shall witness live in brass of this day's work .
Carry me to the jail ?
Shall we do that ?
Now boast thee , Death , in thy possession lies A lass unparalleled .
Thou dost see I eat .
You've strange serpents there ?
I am not sick if Brutus have in hand Any exploit worthy the name of honor .
A foe to tyrants , and my country's friend .
Caesar is sad , and Lepidus , Since Pompey's feast , as Menas says , is troubled With the greensickness .
Why , is not this better now than groaning for love ?
Very vilely in the morning , when he is sober , and most vilely in the afternoon , when he is drunk .
That's he that was Othello .
Thou shalt not choose but go .
One ever near thee .
But nature should bring forth Of its own kind all foison , all abundance , To feed my innocent people .
I will but spend a word here in the house And go with you .
Now she's gone for ever. , Cordelia , Cordelia , stay a little .
Fool !
I can see yet without spectacles , and I see no such matter .
Her dotage now I do begin to pity .
I call thee not .
Give me your hand .
Tis clean out of the way .
Was he not here ?
Some dungeon .
How prove you that in the great heap of your knowledge ?
Graces will appear , and there's an end .
But give me your hand , Menas .
Let us all embrace .
No , by no means .
To tell you true , I counterfeit him .
O insupportable and touching loss !
Beat him enough .
If any man doubt that , let him put me to my purgation .

Leave you !
Go to .

Smile heaven upon this fair conjunction , That long have frowned upon their enmity .
Farewell .
Wilt thou destroy him then ?
Tis even so .
Will your grace command me any service to the world's end ?
I deny it not .
Do you mark that , my lord ?
The king ?
The ancient saying is no heresy .
The one is too like an image and says nothing , and the other too like my lady's eldest son , evermore tattling .
This deed I'll do before this purpose cool .

I protest I love thee .
And all the faith , the virtue of my heart , The object and the pleasure of mine eye , Is only Helena .

Confined together In the same fashion as you gave in charge , Just as you left them , all prisoners , sir , In the line grove which weather-fends your cell .
I could find in my heart to beat him , But that the poor monster's in drink .
Who saw Cesario , ho ?
Then will I lay the serving creature's dagger on your pate .

What the goodyear , my lord , why are you thus out of measure sad ?
You stand .
No .
I spoke with his man .
From this time forth I never will speak word .
And by all means stir on the youth to an answer .
This blue-eyed hag was hither brought with child And here was left by th ' sailors .
But first I'll turn yon fellow in his grave And then return lamenting to my love .
This is the air-drawn dagger which you said Led you to Duncan .

I am their father's mother .
What say'st thou , my fair flower de luce ?
I'll venture so much of my hawk or hound , But twenty times so much upon my wife .
This is some minx's token , and I must take out the work ?
Would I had two coxcombs and two daughters .
Nay , but Beatrice , Sweet Hero , she is wronged , she is slandered , she is undone .
Come hither , Proculeius .
Do you see yonder cloud that's almost in shape of a camel ?
There is no more but so .
None does offend , none , I say , none .
Bring me a father that so loved his child , Whose joy of her is overwhelmed like mine , And bid him speak of patience .
Or , if thou wilt , swear by thy gracious self , Which is the god of my idolatry , And I'll believe thee .
Yes , just .
The second cock hath crowed .
I am called Dercetus .
Presently away , For to strange sores strangely they strain the cure. , Come , lady , die to live .
Go with me and see What I can show in this .
I am none of his flirt-gills .
Hie to high fortune !
So are those crisped snaky golden locks Which maketh such wanton gambols with the wind , Upon supposed fairness , often known To be the dowry of a second head , The skull that bred them in the sepulcher .
They say this town is full of cozenage , As nimble jugglers that deceive the eye , Dark-working sorcerers that change the mind , Soul-killing witches that deform the body , Disguised cheaters , prating mountebanks , And many suchlike liberties of sin .
I almost die for food , and let me have it .
Why , let her except , before excepted .
Did I not bid thee meet me in the park And bring along these rascal knaves with thee ?
Away !
There lies the duke asleep , and there the keys .
No marvel though she pause ; They can be meek that have no other cause .
I'll cross it though it blast me. , Stay , illusion !
Ay , or any show that you will show him .
The tyrannous and bloody act is done , The most arch deed of piteous massacre That ever yet this land was guilty of .
If I do not usurp myself , I am .
Good counsel , marry .
It is my day , my life .
Let me see , let me see .
Noblest of men , woo't die ?
Twas a sweet marriage , and we prosper well in our return .
Go to , they are not men o ' their words .
I tax not you , you elements , with unkindness .
He attends here in the forest on the duke your father .
I met the youthful lord at Lawrence ' cell , And gave him what becomed love I might , Not stepping o'er the bounds of modesty .
Use it for my love some other way than swearing by it .
What news , my lord ?
Spake you not these words plain : "Sirrah , knock me here , rap me here , knock me well , and knock me soundly" ?
And here's another , whose warped looks proclaim What store her heart is made on .
Bate , I beseech you , widow Dido .
Not too fast !
I'll none now .
Alack , sir , I am sand-blind .
The residue of your fortune Go to my cave and tell me. , Good old man , Thou art right welcome as thy master is .
Let's tonight Be bounteous at our meal .
It will make you melancholy , Monsieur Jaques .
My words are dull .
Would none but I might venge my cousin's death !
Why , he drinks you with facility your Dane dead drunk ; he sweats not to overthrow your Almain .
What , have you writ that letter to my sister ?
At first And last , the hearty welcome .
Towards him I made , but he was 'ware of me And stole into the covert of the wood .
Portia is dead .
One knocks .
Fight valiantly today .
There's no doubt his majesty Will soon recover his accustomed health .
You have put him down , lady , you have put him down .
Defend thee !
Caesar doth bear me hard , but he loves Brutus .
How dost thou and thy master agree ?
Lead the way .
Titinius , if thou lovest me , Mount thou my horse , and hide thy spurs in him Till he have brought thee up to yonder troops And here again , that I may rest assured Whether yond troops are friend or enemy .
I will not fail you .
But where the greater malady is fixed The lesser is scarce felt .
Good master , take it not unkindly , pray , That I have been thus pleasant with you both .
But beshrew my jealousy !
For all the rest , They'll take suggestion as a cat laps milk .
And here's a marvelous convenient place for our rehearsal .
Will you come to bed , my lord ?
I am even The natural fool of fortune .
Now , as you are a Roman , tell me true .
But if the cause be not good , the king himself hath a heavy reckoning to make , when all those legs and arms and heads , chopped off in a battle , shall join together at the latter day , and cry all , "We died at such a place , " some swearing , some crying for a surgeon , some upon their wives left poor behind them , some upon the debts they owe , some upon their children rawly left .
Oh , Caesar , This Charmian lived but now .
Twill bring you gain or perish on the seas .
O sir , I do , and will repute you ever The patron of my life and liberty .
Many good morrows to my noble lord .
Our care and pity is so much upon you That we remain your friend .
Why ask you ?
Good , good .
I will confess to you that I love him .
Come .
One kiss , and I'll descend .
How is 't with you , my most fair Bianca ?
Make a short shrift .
I am sorry to give breathing to my purpose , Help me away , dear Charmian !
Sir Topas !
I can not draw a cart , nor eat dried oats .
Honest , my lord ?
I thank you , doctor .
I will say for you .
Descend , for you must be my torchbearer .
I can not love him .
How now , Malvolio !
Take some remembrance of us as a tribute , Not as a fee .
If till the expiration of your month , You will return and sojourn with my sister , Dismissing half your train , come then to me .
Is he not a most profane and liberal counselor ?
Poor souls , they perished .
If not , he foams at mouth and by and by Breaks out to savage madness .
O dear Ophelia , I am ill at these numbers .
That's more to me than my wetting .
Where be these knaves ?
Well , sit we down , And let us hear Barnardo speak of this .
Is 't so , indeed ?
I'll have no bigger .
But tell me true , are you not mad indeed ?
And for my love I pray you wrong me not .
I speak no treason .
I know not , madam .
And she is mine , and all my right of her I do estate unto Demetrius .
Or is your gold and silver ewes and rams ?
What was your dream , my lord ?
Tis well .
First he denied you had in him no right .
Nothing is good , I see , without respect .
Oh , yes , I heard them all , and more too , for some of them had in them more feet than the verses would bear .
You , mistress , all this coil is long of you .
His name is Balthazar .
He was my friend , faithful and just to me .
O bitter consequence That Edward still should live "true noble prince" !
I am his brother , and I love him well .
That may be , sir , when I may be a wife .
No .
She shall be buried by her Antony .
Say I , her sovereign , am her subject low .
And , in conclusion , she shall watch all night , And if she chance to nod I'll rail and brawl , And with the clamor keep her still awake .
She bids you come to her .
This speech of yours hath moved me , And shall perchance do good .
More than pertains to feats of broils and battle , And therefore little shall I grace my cause In speaking for myself .
Why , that's the way To fool their preparation and to conquer Their most absurd intents .
I shall be reconciled to him again .
Urge neither charity nor shame to me .
She is dead .
If you prove a mutineer , the next tree .
Handkerchief , confessions , handkerchief !
While then , God be with you !
Thou art not conquered .
What is the matter ?
Where is my lady ?
But why , why , why ?
Nay , the dust Should have ascended to the roof of heaven , Raised by your populous troops .
Here comes the good Macduff .
Get thee a wife , get thee a wife .
What think'st thou then of Stanley ?
Here was he merry , hearing of a song .
I'll halt after .
To whom do you speak this ?
For first was he contract to Lady Lucy , Your mother lives a witness to that vow , And afterward by substitute betrothed To Bona , sister to the king of France .
Where is he gone ?
What can he say in this ?
Why seek'st thou me ?
Why , this that I speak of .
Thou protector of this damned strumpet , Talk'st thou to me of "ifs" ?
This damned witch Sycorax , For mischiefs manifold and sorceries terrible To enter human hearing , from Argier , Thou know'st , was banished .
To do thus I learned of thee .
Go take this shape And hither come in 't .
Against my will , I am sent to bid you come in to dinner .
We'll know all our fortunes .
The reason that I gather he is mad , Besides this present instance of his rage , Is a mad tale he told today at dinner Of his own doors being shut against his entrance .
The best and soundest of his time hath been but rash .
Didst thou give all to thy two daughters , and art thou come to this ?
Saw you the weird sisters ?
Farewell .
Who knows not that ?
His nurse ?
This is a sleepy tune .
They will steal anything and call it purchase .
Stay , fellow .
Best safety lies in fear .
Therefore Make space enough between you .
Sirrah , go see what trumpet 'tis that sounds .
I will say nothing .
Even so ?
And now they do re-stem Their backward course , bearing with frank appearance Their purposes toward Cyprus .
Some o' their plants are ill-rooted already .
Stay , dog , for thou shalt hear me .
Was ever woman in this humor wooed ?
How should they , when that wise men have no eyes ?
Madam , here comes my lord .
I would she had bestowed this dotage on me .
Tell them that you know that Hero loves me .
I saw 't i ' the orchard .
But sure the bravery of his grief did put me Into a towering passion .
Lord , " quoth he ?
If you like upon report The soil , the profit , and this kind of life , I will your very faithful feeder be And buy it with your gold right suddenly .
He leads himself .
Her love to both Would each to other and all loves to both Draw after her .
Double , double toil and trouble , Fire burn and cauldron bubble .
Give me a taper , call up all my people !
Let not the Nurse lie with thee in thy chamber .
Shall they hoist me up And show me to the shouting varletry Of censuring Rome ?
No .
That's sides and heart .
Here lies your way .
And , friends , disperse yourselves .
Good .
Full of vexation come I with complaint Against my child , my daughter Hermia. , Stand forth , Demetrius. , My noble lord , This man hath my consent to marry her. , Stand forth , Lysander. , And my gracious duke , This man hath bewitched the bosom of my child. , Thou , thou , Lysander , thou hast given her rhymes , And interchanged love tokens with my child .
Speak not .
It is "never tire." Oh .
We , ignorant of ourselves , Beg often our own harms , which the wise powers Deny us for our good , so find we profit By losing of our prayers .
Pay him six thousand and deface the bond !
Of love ?
The clock struck nine when I did send the Nurse .
Why , there's more gold .
I can write very like my lady your niece : on a forgotten matter we can hardly make distinction of our hands .
That skull had a tongue in it and could sing once .
Then learn this of me : to have is to have .
I should first tell thee how the Prince , Claudio and my master , planted and placed and possessed by my master Don John , saw afar off in the orchard this amiable encounter .
But did you not request to have it cut ?
Adieu .
Marry , 'tis enough .
Dear lad , believe it .
You must needs yield your reason , Sir Andrew .
Come forth .
Thus the bowl should run , And not unluckily against the bias .
The gallants desire it .
Within this hour I was his bondman sir , But he , I thank him , gnawed in two my cords .
Why , to put 's head in , not to give it away to his daughters and leave his horns without a case .
And , sister , as the winds give benefit And convey is assistant , do not sleep , But let me hear from you .
Or do you play the flouting jack , to tell us Cupid is a good hare-finder and Vulcan a rare carpenter ?
Of that there's none , or little .
So I am free .
Fair Katherine , and most fair , Will you vouchsafe to teach a soldier terms Such as will enter at a lady's ear And plead his love suit to her gentle heart ?

Know , my hearts , I hope well of tomorrow , and will lead you Where rather I'll expect victorious life Than death and honor .
Well , Susan is with God .
Edmund is dead , my lord .
Let me go , sir , or I'll knock you o'er the mazzard .
Lorenzo , I commit into your hands The husbandry and manage of my house Until my lord's return .
What news with you , sir ?
No , nor more fearful .
It seems that you scorn me .
But , like the owner of a foul disease , To keep it from divulging , let it feed Even on the pith of life .
If you have tears , prepare to shed them now .
What villains have done this ?
Tis certain then for Cyprus .
Lucillius and Titinius , bid the commanders Prepare to lodge their companies tonight .
Oh , look , sir , look , sir !
I saw no man use you at his pleasure .
I think it freely , and betimes in the morning I will beseech the virtuous Desdemona to undertake for me .
Good morrow to you both .
Your hands , come then .
On , on , you noblest English , Whose blood is fet from fathers of war-proof , Fathers that , like so many Alexanders , Have in these parts from morn till even fought And sheathed their swords for lack of argument .
Madam , good hope .
Ay , good my lord .
Thou villain , what sayest thou ?
What is this same ?
Would 'twere done .
I have a letter guessingly set down , Which came from one that's of a neutral heart , And not from one opposed .
Thou art thy father's daughter .
Three in Egypt Can not make better note .
I stay here on my bond .
Not where he eats , but where he is eaten .
O Tybalt , Tybalt , the best friend I had !
My Lord Bassanio , since you have found Antonio , We two will leave you .
Oh , woe the day !
Please you , draw near. , Louder the music there !
Still so constant , lord .
Bring me to Antony .
In his own grace he doth exalt himself More than in your addition .
I have as much of this in art as you , But yet my nature could not bear it so .
Well , I will call Beatrice to you , who I think hath legs .
I marry her !
What black magician conjures up this fiend To stop devoted charitable deeds ?
So stood the state when Henry the Sixth Was crowned in Paris but at nine months old .

Nurse , where's my daughter ?
It is the blessed sun .
It is not meet you know how Caesar loved you .
Mark him .
Come away , away .
And when was he wont to wash his face ?
Tis for the dead , not for the quick .
Metellus Cimber ?
What's here ?
I would my father looked but with my eyes .
Away , I do beseech you , both away .
You do remember all the circumstance ?
Love wrought these miracles .
Say that she rail ; why then I'll tell her plain She sings as sweetly as a nightingale .
Hie therefore , Robin , overcast the night .
Your letters did withhold our breaking forth Till we perceived both how you were wrong led And we in negligent danger .
Sir , sir , that can not be .
How now , worthy soldier ?
Tomorrow We'll hear ourselves again .
This was a merry message .
The strings , my lord , are false .
If thou hadst feared to break an oath by Him , Th ' imperial metal circling now thy head Had graced the tender temples of my child , And both the princes had been breathing here , Which now , two tender bedfellows for dust , Thy broken faith hath made the prey for worms .
What did you mean by that same handkerchief you gave me even now ?
Only be patient till we have appeased The multitude , beside themselves with fear , And then we will deliver you the cause , Why I , that did love Caesar when I struck him , Have thus proceeded .
What day is this ?
You must to Parthia .
Pitchers have ears .
That very hour , and in the selfsame inn , A meaner woman was delivered Of such a burden , male twins , both alike .
Now show the wound mine eye hath made in thee .
I'll tell the news .

My lady bade me tell you , that , though she harbors you as her kinsman , she's nothing allied to your disorders .
No , faith , hate him not , for my sake .
Is all the counsel that we two have shared , The sisters ' vows , the hours that we have spent When we have chid the hasty-footed time For parting us , oh , is it all forgot ?
Therefore stay yet .
Farewell .
Thou need'st not to be gone .
A challenge , on my life .
Your royal father's murdered .
Take up the body .
We doubt not of a fair and lucky war , Since God so graciously hath brought to light This dangerous treason lurking in our way To hinder our beginnings .
Where is kind Hastings ?
Slanders , sir .
Where's Monsieur Cobweb ?
We are for you .
The same indeed , a very valiant fellow .
Were it not better , Because that I am more than common tall , That I did suit me all points like a man ?
I have undone three tailors .
And I must be from thence !
But if you be remembered , I did not bid you mar it to the time .
Light , gentlemen , I'll bind it with my shirt .
Lie with her ?
The oats have eaten the horses .
We will not fail .
The tyranny of the open night's too rough For nature to endure .
Oh , she was heavenly true !
I saw 't not , thought it not , it harmed not me .
Enobarbus ?
Hear me with patience .
Nay , but I know who loves him .
Did not you tell me I should know the man By the Athenian garment he had on ?
I hope your Majesty is pear me testimony and witness , and will avouchment that this is the glove of Alencon that your Majesty is give me , in your conscience now .
I this infer : That many things , having full reference To one consent , may work contrariously , As many arrows loosed several ways Come to one mark , as many ways meet in one town , As many fresh streams meet in one salt sea , As many lines close in the dial's center , So may a thousand actions , once afoot , End in one purpose , and be all well borne Without defeat .
Go therefore , tell thy master : here I am .
Carthage ?
What devil art thou that dost torment me thus ?
Bestow it at your pleasure , and believe Caesar's no merchant , to make prize with you Of things that merchants sold .
Tis gone .
With what I get , I mean , and so do they .
Think you but that I know our state secure , I would be so triumphant as I am ?
Wash your hands .
What shall we hear of this ?
And so , adieu .
Where is the Master , Boatswain ?
Pish for thee , Iceland dog , Thou prick-eared cur of Iceland !
Let no such man be trusted .
But for the handkerchief , By heaven , I would most gladly have forgot it .
And we will mend thy wages .
Look , my lord , it comes !
What is thy will with her ?
See where she comes and brings your froward wives As prisoners to her womanly persuasion. , Katherine , that cap of yours becomes you not .
Think and die .
Had I a glass , I would .
I drink to thee .
Lies all within. , Deliver me the key .
O , for my beads !
Tis but a peevish boy , yet he talks well , But what care I for words ?
Come , some music !
Your Majesty shall mock at me .
Fare ye well .
I found her trimming up the diadem On her dead mistress .
Had I not Four or five women once that tended me ?
Do not then walk too open .
The better for the King of heaven that hath him .
How fondly dost thou reason !
Some are born great , "
But that my Lady Beatrice should know me , and not know me !
I never did deny it .
I'll humbly signify what in his name , That magical word of war , we have effected : How with his banners and his well-paid ranks The ne'er-yet-beaten horse of Parthia We have jaded out o' th' field .
Both wind and tide stays for this gentleman , And I , to blame , have held him here too long .
We please them not by land .
Oh , ho !
Come away , servant , come .
I know it by their pale and deadly looks .
Where shall we dine ? , O me !
Why , give it to my wife , and fetch your money .
But that's all one : omittance is no quittance .
My lord , good morrow .
Barnardo ?
No , my good lord .
Thou liest , thou thread , thou thimble , Thou yard , three-quarters , half-yard , quarter , nail !
I do not think there is any such woman .
Give us kind keepers , heavens !
If there be more , more woeful , hold it in .
We'll draw cuts for the signior .
Hath she forgot already that brave prince , Edward , her lord , whom I some three months since Stabbed in my angry mood at Tewkesbury ?
Sister , you know he promised me a chain .
Dost thou hear , Iago ?
Very well .
Is yonder the man ?
But hush , no more .
But I pray , can you read anything you see ?
Such unconstant starts are we like to have from him as this of Kent's banishment .
Oh , that I served that lady And might not be delivered to the world , Till I had made mine own occasion mellow , What my estate is .
What might be toward , that this sweaty haste Doth make the night joint laborer with the day ?
I am not mad .
But , room , fairy !
You have it full , Benedick .
As manhood shall compound .
Away !
For Antony , I have no ears to his request .
O Stephano , two Neapolitans 'scaped !
I'll unhair thy head !
Have an eye to Cinna .
Was I with you there for the goose ?
Farewell , dear mother .
My noble lords and cousins all , good morrow .
Away , away , for he is coming hither !
For in all the play There is not one word apt , one player fitted .
Lysander and myself will fly this place .
You see her eyes are open .
Was ever woman in this humor won ?
Peace be with Burgundy .
Mine's not an idle cause .
Tarry , good Beatrice .
You .
Take in your love , and then let me alone .
Let us our lives , our souls , our debts , our careful wives , our children , and our sins lay on the king !
Dark night , that from the eye his function takes , The ear more quick of apprehension makes .
I do beseech your Grace pardon me , Who , earnest in the service of my God , Deferred the visitation of my friends .
I must be one of these same dumb wise men , For Gratiano never lets me speak .
Richard except , those whom we fight against Had rather have us win than him they follow .
When I told you My state was nothing , I should then have told you That I was worse than nothing , for indeed I have engaged myself to a dear friend , Engaged my friend to his mere enemy To feed my means .
Show his eyes and grieve his heart .
It is not honesty in me to speak What I have seen and known .
I am your neighbor , and was suitor first .
Do thou meet me presently at the harbor. , Come hither .
I will bring you thither .
Will you mock at an ancient tradition begun upon an honorable respect and worn as a memorable trophy of predeceased valor , and dare not avouch in your deeds any of your words ?
Stop that , 'twill fly with the smoke out at the chimney .
By my life I do , which I tender dearly , though I say I am a magician .
So , so , so , so !
Ay , mother , but I would not have it so .
God restore you to health !
Let pity not be believed." There she shook The holy water from her heavenly eyes , And clamor moistened .
I promise you , my soul is very jocund In the remembrance of so fair a dream .
An you be mine , I'll give you to my friend .
I know he loves me well .
I do remember in this shepherd boy Some lively touches of my daughter's favor .
Oh , thereby hangs a tail .
Go .
Caesar gets money where He loses hearts .
What , and my old Venetian friend Salerio ?
Goes the king hence today ?
Now , Catesby , what says your lord to my request ?
Reproach and everlasting shame Sits mocking in our plumes .
But now I'll tell thee joyful tidings , girl .
I have many enemies in Orsino's court , Else would I very shortly see thee there .
What is yond gentleman ?
Farewell , sweet lord , and sister .
Is there a murderer here ?
You knew , none so well , none so well as you , of my daughter's flight .
We must not now displease him .
I do fear , the people Choose Caesar for their king .
Last night of all , When yond same star that's westward from the pole Had made his course t ' illume that part of heaven Where now it burns , Marcellus and myself , The bell then beating one , Peace , break thee off .
Good faith , a little one , not past a pint , As I am a soldier .
That face of his I do remember well .
Where is he now ?
Seek !
What likelihood of his amendment , lords ?
Ay , madam , but returns again tonight .
Fear you the boar , and go so unprovided ?
The question of Cordelia and her father Requires a fitter place .
Looks he as freshly as he did the day he wrestled ?
Wilt thou not , Jule ? " It stinted and said "ay." And stint thou too , I pray thee , Nurse , say I .
For my uncle is King of Denmark , and those that would make mouths at him while my father lived give twenty , forty , fifty , a hundred ducats apiece for his picture in little .
So am I purposed .
Descend , brother , I say .
I know not that , when he knows what I know .
Let her witness it .
From the Count Orsino , is it ?
I hate the Moor , And it is thought abroad that 'twixt my sheets He's done my office .
I was the more deceived .
Now , out of doubt Antipholus is mad ; Else would he never so demean himself .
To Adriana .
She's dead too , our sovereign .
Let's follow , Gertrude .
I knew a wench married in an afternoon as she went to the garden for parsley to stuff a rabbit , and so may you , sir .
The sweet and bitter fool Will presently appear , The one in motley here , The other found out there .
Let specialties be therefore drawn between us , That covenants may be kept on either hand .
To her , widow !
I'll do 't .
Unknit that threat'ning unkind brow And dart not scornful glances from those eyes To wound thy lord , thy king , thy governor .
You need not fear , lady , the having any of these lords .
Today the lords you talked of are beheaded .
What , are Ancient Pistol and you friends yet ?
Stanley , what news with you ?
Tis Cinna .
Do not you hear a cry ?
I'll not meddle with it .
Men , wives , and children stare , cry out , and run As it were doomsday .
Good morrow , Richmond .
I think so too .
Nay , certainly , I have heard the Ptolemies' pyramises are very goodly things .
I have heard Where many of the best respect in Rome , Except immortal Caesar , speaking of Brutus And groaning underneath this age's yoke , Have wished that noble Brutus had his eyes .
If it will please Caesar To be so good to Caesar as to hear me , I shall beseech him to befriend himself .
He'll fright you up , i ' faith .
Tomorrow , Before the sun shall see 's , we'll spill the blood That has today escaped .
Did I deserve no more than a fool's head ?
Bring me just notice of the numbers dead On both our parts .
Worse and worse !
But , were you wedded , you would bear some sway .
Comes his army on ?
He speaks not true .
Count , take of me my daughter , and with her my fortunes .
Here lies the east .
Do not fret yourself too much in the action , monsieur .
You know not how to choose a man .
Back , slave , or I will break thy pate across .
Vent my folly !
God buy you , take mine office .
Write them together , yours is as fair a name .
Let us to the field .
You had musty victual , and he hath holp to eat it .
Touched you the bastardy of Edward's children ?
Are we all met ?
O Thou , whose captain I account myself , Look on my forces with a gracious eye .
Will 't please your Honor taste of these conserves ?
For our bad neighbor makes us early stirrers , Which is both healthful and good husbandry .
Shall I tell you why ?
Talk not to me , for I'll not speak a word .
An angel is like you , Kate , and you are like an angel .
And , gentle master , I received no gold .
I prithee name the time , but let it not Exceed three days .
Lead me .
The little dogs and all , Tray , Blanch , and Sweetheart , see , they bark at me .
What , To kiss in private ?
Now he tells how she plucked him to my chamber .
For that you must But say I could not help it .
Robin Starveling , the tailor ?
Set him before me .
Heaven and yourself Had part in this fair maid .
Stay , madam .
Who of my people hold him in delay ?
Love's heralds should be thoughts , Which ten times faster glide than the sun's beams , Driving back shadows over louring hills .
Then the liars and swearers are fools , for there are liars and swearers enough to beat the honest men and hang up them .
We will spare for no wit , I warrant you .
He is addressed .
But he sleeps .
Come , one for me .
Toward Peloponnesus are they fled .
What , you mean my face ?
Triple-turned whore !
Therefore know I have earned of Don John a thousand ducats .
My master will be here ere morning .
I am debating of my present store , And by the near guess of my memory I can not instantly raise up the gross Of full three thousand ducats .
Keep close , I thee command .
Write from us to him .
I never saw my father in my life .
Peace , sirrah !
Talk no more .
Nay , let's follow him .
I am glad he's come , howsoe'er he comes .
Pray you , if it be , give it me , for I am slow of study .
Where's thy conscience now ?
He hath fought today As if a god , in hate of mankind , had Destroyed in such a shape .
Albeit you have deserved High commendation , true applause , and love , Yet such is now the duke's condition That he misconsters all that you have done .
I pray thee , mark me .
When it concerns the fool or coward .
Madam , I go with all convenient speed .
Ay , my commander .
This is the day which , in King Edward's time , I wished might fall on me when I was found False to his children and his wife's allies .
God be with you all .
Where is she ?
Here , here will I remain With worms that are thy chamber maids .
Get on your nightgown , lest occasion call us And show us to be watchers .
Here's yet some liquor left .
I know you could not lack , I am certain on 't , Very necessity of this thought , that I , Your partner in the cause 'gainst which he fought , Could not with graceful eyes attend those wars Which fronted mine own peace .
How canst thou try them so ?
Give me a calendar .
The enemy comes on in gallant show .
They must lie there .
Companion , hence !
The constable of France .
No beast so fierce but knows some touch of pity .
The matter ?
Twas never merry world Since lowly feigning was call'd compliment .
Why ?
Be assured you may .
Can any of your neighbors tell , Kate ?
She that would alter services with thee , The Fortunate Unhappy" Daylight and champaign discovers not more .
And know it now : the senate have concluded To give this day a crown to mighty Caesar .
I am more proud to be Sir Rowland's son , His youngest son , and would not change that calling To be adopted heir to Frederick .
For what had he to do to chide at me ?
I will watch tonight .
What tidings can you tell me of my lord ?
How now , sir ?
A contagious breath .
The play's the thing Wherein I'll catch the conscience of the king .
Remember thee !
And now you know my meaning .
All which time Before the gods my knee shall bow my prayers To them for you .
Dismount thy tuck , be yare in thy preparation , for thy assailant is quick , skillful and deadly .
I marvel Cambio comes not all this while .
Look how thy servants do attend on thee , Each in his office ready at thy beck .
I charge thee , hence , and do not haunt me thus .
Are you full of them ?
Stand fast together , lest some friend of Caesar's Should chance , Talk not of standing. , Publius , good cheer .
Let me be clear of thee .
Fie on thee !
In the name lay A moiety of the world .
Look , he recovers .
Where may we set our horses ?
Remember March , the ides of March remember .
Be patient , for you shall remain with us .
The rest aloof are the Dardanian wives , With bleared visages come forth to view The issue of th ' exploit. , Go , Hercules !
O villain , villain !
Shall I be tempted of the devil thus ?
How low am I , thou painted maypole ?
Come , stir , stir , stir !
I had else been perfect , Whole as the marble , founded as the rock , As broad and general as the casing air .
Thou didst prevent me .
I pray thee , good Mercutio , let's retire .
Your worship's friend and Launcelot , sir .
Would I were in an alehouse in London !
Yet 'tis the plague to great ones , Prerogatived are they less than the base .
Look you who comes here , a young man and an old in solemn talk .
Art thou there , Diomed ?
You've said , sir .
I have a suit to you .
I shall entreat him To answer like himself .
Thanks , Guildenstern and gentle Rosencrantz .
Too swift arrives as tardy as too slow .
Adieu .
A pound of man's flesh taken from a man Is not so estimable , profitable neither , As flesh of muttons , beefs , or goats .
Why , here he comes , swelling like a turkey-cock .
O , I die , Horatio .
If wolves had at thy gate howled that stern time , Thou shouldst have said , "Good porter , turn the key , " All cruels else subscribed .
A play there is , my lord , some ten words long , Which is as brief as I have known a play .
We look for you tomorrow .
There , my lord .
What trumpet is that same ?
Go you and tell my daughter I would speak with her .
Nor heaven nor earth have been at peace tonight .
And then , I hope , thou wilt be satisfied .
In God's name , what art thou ?
In faith , hath not the world one man but he will wear his cap with suspicion ?
My husband ?
Who's there ?
I would they were , that I might die at once , For now they kill me with a living death .
Stand aside .
True , " said she , "a fine little one." "No , " said I , "a great wit." "Right , " says she , "a great gross one." "Nay , " said I , "a good wit." "Just , " said she , "it hurts nobody." "Nay , " said I , "the gentleman is wise." "Certain , " said she , "a wise gentleman." "Nay , " said I , "he hath the tongues." "That I believe , " said she , "for he swore a thing to me on Monday night , which he forswore on Tuesday morning ; there's a double tongue , there's two tongues." Thus did she an hour together transshape thy particular virtues .
What in the contrary ?
We will hence forthwith To feast and sport us at thy father's house .
Now , by this hand , I swear , I scorn the term , Nor shall my Nell keep lodgers .
I had as lief have my mistress a jade .
Ay , sweet Rosalind .
I have done .
Lay them in gore , Since you have shore With shears his thread of silk .
Well , my good lord , I have informed them so .
Awake , awake !
Sir , no .
How now , sirrah !
So it should be , that none but Antony Should conquer Antony , but woe 'tis so !
Make your best use of this .
I am glad on 't .
O thou invisible spirit of wine , if thou hast no name to be known by , let us call thee devil !
O God , she comes. , O honey Nurse , what news ?
Foolish curs , that run winking into the mouth of a Russian bear and have their heads crushed like rotten apples .
By report I know him well .
Tomorrow , soldier , By sea and land I'll fight .
Ay , madam .
Murder and treason !
Tis just .
Leave me with haste .
He that parts us shall bring a brand from heaven And fire us hence like foxes .
Come thy ways , Signior Fabian .
This is the fool that lent out money gratis .
I am the very man , I'll see that straight .
What say you then to Falconbridge , the young baron of England ?
Go , go , dispatch .
Quick , quick !
And when that time comes , Afflict me with thy mocks , pity me not , As till that time I shall not pity thee .
Lead away .
A guiltless death I die .
So , slave , hence !
Ha , art thou bedlam ?
Edmund , seek him out , wind me into him , I pray you .
Upon that I kiss your hand , and I call you my queen .
Thou dost snore distinctly .
Somebody knocks .
The son of Clarence have I pent up close , His daughter meanly have I matched in marriage , The sons of Edward sleep in Abraham's bosom , And Anne my wife hath bid this world goodnight .
These foolish drops do something drown my manly spirit .
Sweet , so would I .
Patience , good sir .
Farewell both .
In Caesar's fleet Are those that often have 'gainst Pompey fought .
Here will we sit and let the sounds of music Creep in our ears .
How fares my lord ?
Away !
Go put on thy defenses .
The duke of York commends him to your Majesty .
What's the matter ?
Look where the youngest wren of nine comes .
We see it and will say it .
And , I think , if my breast had not been made of faith , and my heart of steel , She had transformed me to a curtal dog and made me turn i ' th ' wheel .
By my troth , it is well said .
Look down , you gods , And on this couple drop a blessed crown , For it is you that have chalked forth the way Which brought us hither .
He left behind him myself and a sister , both born in an hour .
With all my heart , and much it joys me too To see you are become so penitent. , Tressel and Berkeley , go along with me .
Do not you wear your dagger in your cap that day , lest he knock that about yours .
Why dost thou call him "knave" ?
Or keep it as a cistern for foul toads To knot and gender in !
I know when one is dead and when one lives .
Thus it must be .
I am young , but something You may deserve of him through me , and wisdom To offer up a weak , poor , innocent lamb T ' appease an angry god .
What company is this ?
But she is none .
One , Kate , that you must kiss and be acquainted with. , Where are my slippers ?
Heigh-ho .
My lord and you were then at Mantua. , Nay , I do bear a brain. , But , as I said , When it did taste the wormwood on the nipple Of my dug and felt it bitter , pretty fool , To see it tetchy and fall out with the dug !
Why , whither , Adam , wouldst thou have me go ?
Madam , I have a touch of your condition , Which can not brook the accent of reproof .
Speak no more of him ; you'll be whipped for taxation one of these days .
No , we'll reason with him .
But I had rather fast from all four days Than drink so much in one .
Kind and dear princess !
Katherine the curst ! " A title for a maid of all titles the worst .
Believe me , King of Shadows , I mistook .
The most you sought was her promotion , For 'twas your heaven she should be advanced .
Behold it stained With his most noble blood .
Then does he say he lent me Some shipping , unrestored .
The words expressly are "a pound of flesh." Take then thy bond , take thou thy pound of flesh , But in the cutting it if thou dost shed One drop of Christian blood , thy lands and goods Are by the laws of Venice confiscate Unto the state of Venice .
Peace , children , peace .
Why are our bodies soft and weak and smooth , Unapt to toil and trouble in the world , But that our soft conditions and our hearts Should well agree with our external parts ?
He sings at grave- making .
A deed without a name .
Nature in you stands on the very verge Of his confine .
I am peppered , I warrant , for this world .
Ay , springes to catch woodcocks .
Madam , in Rome .
Here is everything advantageous to life .
And one Deformed is one of them .
Nay , then , good night our part .
Their residence , both in reputation and profit , was better both ways .
Hath she made her affection known to Benedick ?
I will piece out the comfort with what addition I can .
Then he's a rogue , and a passy-measures pavin .
He would make but a sport of it and torment the poor lady worse .
Not on thy sole , but on thy soul , harsh Jew , Thou makest thy knife keen .
And when she put it on , she made me vow That I should neither sell nor give nor lose it .
I have seen you both .
Could beauty , my lord , have better commerce than with honesty ?
And let those that play your clowns speak no more than is set down for them , for there be of them that will themselves laugh to set on some quantity of barren spectators to laugh too , though in the meantime some necessary question of the play be then to be considered .
The villain is much lighter-heeled than I. I followed fast , but faster he did fly , That fallen am I in dark uneven way ,
His employment between his lord and my niece confirms no less .
What is Thisbe ?
My invocation Is fair and honest .
I thank you , madam .
How much unlike art thou Mark Antony !
And since you know you can not see yourself So well as by reflection , I , your glass , Will modestly discover to yourself That of yourself which you yet know not of .
If they will fight with us , bid them come down , Or void the field .
For your part , To you our swords have leaden points , Mark Antony .
Thou hast some suit to Caesar , hast thou not ?
O Lord , methought what pain it was to drown , What dreadful noise of waters in my ears , What sights of ugly death within my eyes .
Caesar , 'tis strucken eight .
You are well fleshed .
I will fetch up your goats , Audrey .
I shall devise something .
How , will she none ?
I am sure no man hath any quarrel to me .
Sirs , take up the corse .
Happy were England would this virtuous prince Take on his grave the sovereignty thereof .
Is he not light of brain ?
In every good thing .
Go , you wild bedfellow , you can not soothsay .
Grief of my son's exile hath stopped her breath .
Because that I familiarly sometimes Do use you for my fool and chat with you , Your sauciness will jest upon my love And make a common of my serious hours .
Farewell the neighing steed and the shrill trump , The spirit-stirring drum , th ' ear-piercing fife , The royal banner , and all quality , Pride , pomp , and circumstance of glorious war !
Ay , husband .
To flatter Caesar , would you mingle eyes With one that ties his points ?
And who is England's king but great York's heir ?
Were he not warmed with ale , This were a bed but cold to sleep so soundly .
Meantime forbear , And let mischance be slave to patience. , Bring forth the parties of suspicion .
When came this to you ?
Even so .
If ever he go alone again , I'll never wrestle for prize more .
Welcome , good Robin .
Worthy Macbeth , we stay upon your leisure .
What , keep a week away ?
What is , my lord ?
No more be done .
Tis since the earthquake now eleven years , And she was weaned , I never shall forget it , Of all the days of the year , upon that day .
Wherein went he ?
I found it thrown in at the casement of my closet .
If it were now to die , 'Twere now to be most happy , for I fear My soul hath her content so absolute That not another comfort like to this Succeeds in unknown fate .
O Regan , she hath tied Sharp-toothed unkindness , like a vulture , here .
Very well .
Bring it hither to me in the orchard .
We will go walk a little in the orchard , And then to dinner .
Look , Don Pedro is returned to seek you .
I shall do't , my lord .
No grave upon the earth shall clip in it A pair so famous .
He'll say 'twas done cowardly , when he wakes .
My very hairs do mutiny , for the white Reprove the brown for rashness , and they them For fear and doting .
Long stayed he so .
Go waken Juliet .
How well my comfort is revived by this !
How if he will not stand ?
I'll fetch some flax and whites of eggs To apply to his bleeding face .
Well , we shall sift him. , Welcome , my good friends !
When I did make thee free , swor'st thou not then To do this when I bade thee ?
Observe her , stand close .
That ever holds .
Where have I been ?
The galleys Have sent a dozen sequent messengers This very night at one another's heels , And many of the consuls , raised and met , Are at the Duke's already .
I pray you , master , tell me ?
Well , fare you well , my lord .
Talkers are no good doers .
Our present business Is to general woe .
That she may long live here , God say amen .
But as 'tis , We can not miss him .
Why , so didst thou .
O , yet defend me , friends .
I thought so then , I'll kill myself for grief .
Come , let's all take hands Till that the conquering wine hath steeped our sense In soft and delicate Lethe .
My lord , what is your will ?
Tis with cares .
Belike some noble gentleman that means , Traveling some journey , to repose him here .
We have scorched the snake , not killed it .
Finish , good lady .
Are you a man ?
No woman's heart So big , to hold so much .
Tis destiny unshunnable , like death .
Go show your slaves how choleric you are And make your bondmen tremble .
You see how full of changes his age is .
I dare not drink yet , madam .
Pray , have you not a daughter Called Katherina , fair and virtuous ?
My good friends , hark !
But good lieutenant , is your general wived ?
I am very sorry that you are not well .
Alas , he is betrayed and I undone .
You understand me ?
Go charge Agrippa Plant those that have revolted in the vant , That Antony may seem to spend his fury Upon himself .
Harpier cries , "'Tis time , 'tis time." Round about the cauldron go , In the poisoned entrails throw .
True , madam .
What's thy passion ?
The perdition of th ' athversary hath been very great , reasonable great .
Your wives , your daughters , Your matrons , and your maids could not fill up The cistern of my lust , and my desire All continent impediments would o'erbear That did oppose my will .
Let our best heads Know that tomorrow the last of many battles We mean to fight .
Stir with the lark tomorrow , gentle Norfolk .
Here , sweet lord , at your service .
Am not I your Rosalind ?
O , come in , equivocator .
Make all the money thou canst .
Draw and come .
Did he not say my brother was fled ?
It is more worthy to leap in ourselves Than tarry till they push us .
She hath betrayed me and shall die the death .
You'll have your nephews neigh to you .
I Beyond all limit of what else i ' th ' world Do love , prize , honor you .
Thus have I politicly begun my reign , And 'tis my hope to end successfully .
Twill not be seen in him there .
So the poor third is up , till death enlarge his confine .
By my troth , I would not undertake her in this company .
Wilt thou make a trust a transgression ?
Didst thou not hear their shouts ?
That's two of his weapons .
The fault of it I'll answer .
I think not of them .
Wilt thou , Silvius ?
Thou art Dromio , thou art my man , thou art thyself .
Knock , knock !
Marry , sir , we say we are none .
O , she would laugh me Out of myself , press me to death with wit .
How goes the night , boy ?
What think you of this fool , Malvolio ?
I know not by what power I am made bold Nor how it may concern my modesty In such a presence here to plead my thoughts , But I beseech your grace that I may know The worst that may befall me in this case , If I refuse to wed Demetrius .
Dost thou love me ?
Lives he , good uncle ?
Beware Macduff .
Such welcome and unwelcome things at once 'T is hard to reconcile .
Will they not say afterwards , if they should grow themselves to common players ( as it is most like if their means are no better ) , their writers do them wrong to make them exclaim against their own succession ?
If you will watch his going thence ( which I will fashion to fall out between twelve and one ) you may take him at your pleasure .
This is open .
Why , now I see there's mettle in thee , and even from this instant to build on thee a better opinion than ever before .
I remember when I was in love I broke my sword upon a stone and bid him take that for coming a- night to Jane Smile .
Though Birnam Wood be come to Dunsinane , And thou opposed , being of no woman born , Yet I will try the last .
The villain shall not 'scape .
Tis a good hand , A frank one .
They stared , and were distracted .
It must be your imagination then , and not theirs .
I am not so well as I should be , but I'll ne'er out .
Go with me To bless this twain that they may prosperous be , And honored in their issue .
On a moderate pace I have since arrived but hither .
We shall ne'er be younger .
He hath made me a Christian .
The noble duke my master , My worthy arch and patron , comes tonight .
Tis new to thee .
In praising Antony , I have dispraised Caesar .
Lorenzo , and thy love .
Couple it with something .
I thank my stars I am happy .
This murderous shaft that's shot Hath not yet lighted , and our safest way Is to avoid the aim .
Peace , ho !
Soft , Caesar .
Run , run , O , run !
Kill Brutus , and be honored in his death .
Nay , do not quarrel with us , good old man .
For England his approaches makes as fierce As waters to the sucking of a gulf .
Even this repays me. , We sent our schoolmaster .
What , wouldst thou have a serpent sting thee twice ?
Get you gone , And at the pit of Acheron Meet me i ' th ' morning .
Tut , I like it not .
Thou hast served me with much faith .
Oh , that your frowns would teach my smiles such skill !
Where's my knave , my fool ? , Go you , and call my fool hither .
Where art thou , keeper ?
Give me some help .
Bruised pieces , go .
Here comes the man you mean .
The people love me , and the sea is mine .
God speak this "amen" !
Be not afraid , though you do see me weaponed .
O good Antonio , forgive me your trouble .
It shall go hard if "Cambio" go without her .
He is , my lord , and safe in Leicester town , Whither , if it please you , we may now withdraw us .
O , you give me ill counsel .
Look you , she loved her kinsman Tybalt dearly , And so did I .
A right good markman !
And they are gone .
But saying o'er what I have said before .
O , yes , my lord , but very idle words .
Be certain , nothing truer .
Heaven and thy thoughts are witness that thou art .
O brave touch !
I mean , to go , sir , to enter .
Let the old ruffian know I have many other ways to die , meantime Laugh at his challenge .
I therefore vouch again That with some mixtures powerful o'er the blood Or with some dram , conjured to this effect , He wrought upon her .
Sir , you and I must part , but that's not it .
But , mistress , know yourself .
Every one that does so is a traitor and must be hanged .
Marry , come up , I trow .
Why , sir , give the gods a thankful sacrifice .
O most unhappy strumpet !
Monster , I do smell all horse piss , at which my nose is in great indignation .
Poor man !
The queen carouses to thy fortune , Hamlet .
Who builds his hopes in air of your good looks Lives like a drunken sailor on a mast , Ready with every nod to tumble down Into the fatal bowels of the deep .
Thank you .
Why , I am sorry for thee , gentle Silvius .
Only myself stood out ; For which , if I be lapsed in this place , I shall pay dear .
I will here be with thee presently , and if I bring thee not something to eat , I will give thee leave to die .
If ever thou come to me and say , after tomorrow , "This is my glove , " by this hand I will take thee a box on the ear .
Slay !
Observe his construction of it .
What , will you not suffer me ?
But what is the sport , monsieur , that the ladies have lost ?
Sir Paris , I will make a desperate tender Of my child's love .
So do I ever For had I cursed now , I had cursed myself .
The excuse that thou dost make in this delay Is longer than the tale thou dost excuse .
Towards Chertsey , noble lord ?
O these deliberate fools !
O sir , very well : here in your orchard .
As he was fortunate , I rejoice at it .
No , Corin , being old , thou canst not guess , Though in thy youth thou wast as true a lover As ever sighed upon a midnight pillow .
I never saw an action of such shame .
Swum ashore , man , like a duck .
What news from Genoa ?
Naughty lady , These hairs which thou dost ravish from my chin Will quicken and accuse thee .
It is an accustomed action with her to seem thus washing her hands .
Hence .
I'll to him .
What is his strength by land ?
But in this case of wooing , A child shall get a sire , if I fail not of my cunning .
O thou dull Moor !
Horrible steep .
And lawfully by this the Jew may claim A pound of flesh to be by him cut off Nearest the merchant's heart. , Be merciful .
But lest my liking might too sudden seem , I would have salved it with a longer treatise .
What players are they ?
Why , but there's many a man hath more hair than wit .
I'll serve you , sir , five hundred at the rate .
Had you not been their father , these white flakes Did challenge pity of them .
I would I had your bond , for I perceive A weak bond holds you .
I did , my lord .
He has almost supped .
I mean , sir , for his weapon .
Well struck !
Alack , what heinous sin is it in me To be ashamed to be my father's child !
Sir , are not you my father ?
What is his name ?
Past all expressing .
I prithee , who ?
If not to answer , you might haply think Tongue-tied ambition , not replying , yielded To bear the golden yoke of sovereignty , Which fondly you would here impose on me .
Petruchio , go thy ways ; the field is won .
Friends , part ! " and , swifter than his tongue , His agile arm beats down their fatal points , And 'twixt them rushes , underneath whose arm An envious thrust from Tybalt hit the life Of stout Mercutio , and then Tybalt fled .
How now , gentleman ?
I would not so much as make water but in a sink-a-pace .
I have no way , and therefore want no eyes .
Had our general Been what he knew himself , it had gone well .
Let it alone .
How came her eyes so bright ?
Question it , Horatio .
Why , well .
Ay , more .
So that my speed to Mantua there was stayed .
Zounds , hold your peace .
You are unkind , Demetrius .
My father dead , my fortune lives for me .
He's married .
Oh , here Will I set up my everlasting rest , And shake the yoke of inauspicious stars From this world-wearied flesh .
Gloucester , 'tis true that we are in great danger .
Know'st thou not That I have fined these bones of mine for ransom ?
Then you will bring the chain to her yourself .
And I do hope good days and long to see .
O , then , dear saint , let lips do what hands do .
What say you ?
Was my father a traitor , Mother ?
It is not day .
There it goes , Silver !
God , the best maker of all marriages , Combine your hearts in one , your realms in one .
My lord , I do protest , O , do not swear !
Methinks the ground is even .
Of what color ?
What , art thou come ? , On , gentlemen , away !
Peace yet again .
Edward's unhappy sons do bid thee flourish .
Hast thou no care of me ?
How now shall this be compassed ?
Is that the naked fellow ?
Haply a woman's voice may do some good , When articles too nicely urged be stood on .
I'll set a bourn how far to be beloved .
For taking one's part that's out of favor .
Is Brutus sick ?
Or have we eaten on the insane root That takes the reason prisoner ?
What is your will ?
Where souls do couch on flowers , we'll hand in hand , And with our sprightly port make the ghosts gaze .
Ay , my good lord .
He shall live a man forbid .
The weakest kind of fruit Drops earliest to the ground , and so let me .
I will not have to do with you .
Come , Sir Andrew , there's no remedy .
I prithee , do so .
There the grown serpent lies .
Tis now near night .
Oh , strange !
Each heart in Rome does love and pity you .
You shall be king .
Tis a fearful odds .
What , are you hurt , lieutenant ?
You say not right , old man .
And find I am alone felicitate In your dear highness ' love .
Therefore wast thou Deservedly confined into this rock , Who hadst deserved more than a prison .
I could interpret between you and your love , if I could see the puppets dallying .
What wilt thou do ?
Master , master !
Where is gentle Rivers , Vaughan , Grey ?
I can not speak of this .
I learned it in England where indeed they are most potent in potting .
Cousin of Buckingham , a word with you .
Realms and islands were As plates dropped from his pocket .
None good , my liege , to please you with the hearing , Nor none so bad but well may be reported .
There's something in 't That is deceivable .
I kiss his dirty shoe , and from heartstring I love the lovely bully .
Not black in my mind , though yellow in my legs .
Thou hotly lust'st to use her in that kind For which thou whipp'st her .
Oh , behold How pomp is followed !
I am glad to see your highness .
But old folks , many feign as they were dead , Unwieldy , slow , heavy , and pale as lead .
Honest Nurse , farewell .
Hark , boy !
For Pyramus is a sweet-faced man , a proper man as one shall see in a summer's day , a most lovely , gentlemanlike man .
My lord , I hold my life as dear as you do yours , And never in my days , I do protest , Was it so precious to me as 'tis now .
Cast on no water .
Perchance , Iago , I will ne'er go home .
I pause for a reply .
Of very ill manner .
Dido and her Aeneas shall want troops , And all the haunt be ours. , Come , Eros , Eros !
Shake ! " quoth the dovehouse .
What wouldst thou do , old man ?
But who comes here ?
Say that thou overheardst us , And bid her steal into the pleached bower Where honeysuckles ripened by the sun Forbid the sun to enter , like favorites Made proud by princes , that advance their pride Against that power that bred it .
Dry up in her the organs of increase , And from her derogate body never spring A babe to honor her .
You may gather more .
Be bloody , bold , and resolute .
Come , Dromio , come , these jests are out of season .
Let's then determine with the ancient of war On our proceedings .
Mine ache to think on 't .
Come .
He says for Brutus ' sake He finds himself beholding to us all .
Plots have I laid , inductions dangerous , By drunken prophecies , libels and dreams , To set my brother Clarence and the king In deadly hate , the one against the other ; And if King Edward be as true and just As I am subtle , false , and treacherous , This day should Clarence closely be mewed up About a prophecy which says that "G" Of Edward's heirs the murderer shall be .
Let them come in .
Tybalt is gone , and Romeo banished .
Alas , why gnaw you so your nether lip ?
He finished indeed his mortal act That day that made my sister thirteen years .
Stand away , Captain Gower .
Prithee , peace .
Well run , Thisbe !
Hast thou , spirit , Performed to point the tempest that I bade thee ?
I'll have an action of battery against him if there be any law in Illyria .
How does he love me ?
Hamlet." This in obedience hath my daughter shown me , And more above , hath his solicitings , As they fell out by time , by means , and place , All given to mine ear .
Alas , he faints !
This is the fruits of whoring .
Why , then , tomorrow I can not serve your turn for Rosalind ?
He had a fever when he was in Spain , And when the fit was on him , I did mark How he did shake .
Why thou , loss upon loss !
Prithee , Emilia , Go know of Cassio where he supped tonight. ,
Mistress , that you know .
No marvel , lord , though it affrighted you .
You talk !
I am ashamed that women are so simple To offer war where they should kneel for peace ; Or seek for rule , supremacy and sway When they are bound to serve , love , and obey .
O spite of spites !
Be not afraid of greatness." 'T was well writ .
Here I'll sit i ' th ' midst .
Methinks I should know you , and know this man .
Montague !
My lord , I will not .
Fellows , let's be gone .
Go in with me , and I will tell you my drift .
I like the new tire within excellently , if the hair were a thought browner ; and your gown's a most rare fashion , i ' faith .
But there's no bottom , none , In my voluptuousness .
Yonder comes my master , your brother .

You wrong me , Signior Gremio .
I humbly thank your ladyship .
Treason !
A plague upon you all !
To what end did I bid thee hie thee home ?
Ay , my lord .
Why , now , blow wind , swell billow , and swim bark !
This day , great duke , she shut the doors upon me While she with harlots feasted in my house .
You told a lie , an odious , damned lie .

See me no more , whether he be dead or no .
I am your wife if you will marry me .
To Ireland , I .

When Jacob grazed his uncle Laban's sheep , This Jacob from our holy Abram was , As his wise mother wrought in his behalf , The third possessor , ay , he was the third , And what of him ?

It is a wise father that knows his own child .
I will deny thee nothing !
I take my leave of you .
That's good .
Well , peace be with you , sir .
It is a branch and parcel of mine oath , A charitable duty of my order .
So please you , he is here at the door and importunes access to you .
Give me thy hand .
I remember thine eyes well enough .

But do not stain The even virtue of our enterprise , Nor th ' insuppressive mettle of our spirits , To think that or our cause or our performance Did need an oath , when every drop of blood That every Roman bears , and nobly bears , Is guilty of a several bastardy If he do break the smallest particle Of any promise that hath passed from him .
Romeo !

I was not born to die on Brutus ' sword .
Half-blooded fellow , yes .
Speak , my fair , and fairly , I pray thee .
We wish your peace .
Tis pity that thou liv'st To walk where any honest men resort .
If there were no more women but Fulvia , then had you indeed a cut , and the case to be lamented .
Well , I will undertake it .
Yet fortune can not recompense me better Than to die well , and not my master's debtor .
The love that follows us sometime is our trouble , Which still we thank as love .
So take her to thee , shepherd .
When I desire their leave that I might pity him , they took from me the use of mine own house , charged me on pain of their perpetual displeasure neither to speak of him , entreat for him , nor any way sustain him .
Then put up your pipes in your bag , for I'll away .

Now , Roderigo , Where didst thou see her ? , Oh , unhappy girl ! , With the Moor , say'st thou ? , Who would be a father ? , How didst thou know 'twas she ? , Oh , she deceives me Past thought ! , What said she to you ? , Get more tapers , Raise all my kindred .
Why , this is an arrant counterfeit rascal .
How now , daughter ?
I prithee , hear me speak .
Doubtful it stood , As two spent swimmers that do cling together And choke their art .
I'll go find a shadow and sigh till he come .
You are there followed by a faithful shepherd .
If you do free your children from the sword , Your children's children quits it in your age .
Thus with a kiss I die .
The players can not keep counsel .
Yea , wherefore should she not ?
But for all this thou shalt have as many dolors for thy daughters as thou canst tell in a year .

O Hamlet , thou hast cleft my heart in twain .
Ay , dread Queen .
The one the other poisoned for my sake , And after slew herself .
I prithee , Strato , stay thou by thy lord .
This health to Lepidus !
Kindness in women , not their beauteous looks , Shall win my love , and so I take my leave , In resolution as I swore before .
An adder did it , for with doubler tongue Than thine , thou serpent , never adder stung .

He is drowned Whom thus we stray to find , and the sea mocks Our frustrate search on land .
Menas , I'll not on shore .
Some dear friend dead , else nothing in the world Could turn so much the constitution Of any constant man .
What shall we do , Enobarbus ?
Come , Hamlet , come , and take this hand from me .
No farther than the Tower , and , as I guess , Upon the like devotion as yourselves , To gratulate the gentle princes there .
He taught me how to know a man in love , in which cage of rushes I am sure you are not prisoner .
Our yoke and sufferance show us womanish .
I knew it would be your answer .
Was this before the king returned ?
Most savage and unnatural !
I will have nothing else but only this .
Give every man thy ear but few thy voice .
It can not be that she hath done thee wrong .
Was that mine ?
If it be love indeed , tell me how much .
Thou hast seen these signs .
Trail'st thou the puissant pike ?
O my brave Emperor , this is fought indeed !
Self-harming jealousy , fie , beat it hence .
He misses not much .
We will proceed no further in this business .
Good friend , go to him .
Why that's with watching , 'twill away again .
Thou must not take my former sharpness ill .
Answer as I call you. , Nick Bottom , the weaver ?

Let me see now ,
Royal Egypt , Empress !
If she will return me my jewels I will give over my suit and repent my unlawful solicitation .

But she as far surpasseth Sycorax As great'st does least .
So will it fare with Claudio .

For I ne'er saw true beauty till this night .
None but a holy hermit and her maid .
Not that I know .
Stand , ho !
God keep your Lordship in that gracious mind .
Well , I will do it , though I take thee in the king's company .
Nay , by 'r Lady , I am not such a fool to think what I list , nor I list not to think what I can , nor indeed I can not think , if I would think my heart out of thinking , that you are in love or that you will be in love or that you can be in love .
We'll burn his body in the holy place , And with the brands fire the traitors ' houses .
Banquo and Donalbain !
I do desire we may be better strangers .
Ay , the heads of the maids , or their maidenheads .
Death is my heir .
Go on before .
Come , my sweet Kate .
God bless your Grace with health and happy days .
O rude unthankfulness !
Is that his answer ?
To the tuition of God .
The ground indeed is tawny .
Oh , God 'i ' good e'en .
I would breed from hence occasions , and I shall , That I may speak .
The king doth love you well .
If you did wear a beard upon your chin , I'd shake it on this quarrel .
Tell him I have moved my lord on his behalf , and hope all will be well .
Fool , I say !
But I pray you , ergo , old man , ergo , I beseech you , talk you of young Master Launcelot ?
You have among you killed a sweet and innocent lady .
I mean not cuckold mad , But sure he is stark mad .
It hangs like flax on a distaff .
O heavy deed !
Should I have answered Caius Cassius so ?
Which I take to be either a fool or a cipher .
Now , forward with your tale. , Prithee , stand farther off .
Why , how now , Charmian ?
Shut doors after you .
Lord , how it looks about !
Good nuncle , in , and ask thy daughters blessing .
Why , why is this ?
Right , I mean you .
He hath , my lord .

A husband ?
Stand here , make a good show on 't .
Methought their souls whose bodies Richard murdered Came to my tent and cried on victory .
Are my deserts no better ?
All is but toys .
He would have deserved it .
The passages of alleys , creeks , and narrow lands ; A hound that runs counter and yet draws dryfoot well , One that before the judgment carries poor souls to hell .
I robbed his wound of it .
Fool , I'll requite it in the highest degree .
Why then , resolve me whether you will or no .
Here comes the noble Antony .
Yet you are withered .
Live , live !
Now shall you see the other .
I must needs tell thee all .
Briefly , I dwell by the Capitol .
This is a dear manikin to you , Sir Toby .
Thou dost thy office fairly .
No , 'tis not so deep as a well nor so wide as a church-door , but 'tis enough , 'twill serve .
Ha !
What woman's man ?
The wind sits in the shoulder of your sail And you are stayed for .
Fetch thy master home .

But near him thy angel Becomes afeard , as being o'erpowered .

Cassio hath here been set on in the dark By Roderigo and fellows that are 'scaped .
So shalt thou show me friendship .
Tis but an hour ago since it was nine , And after one hour more 'twill be eleven .
And an ill singer , my lord .
But there's a saying very old and true : "If that you will France win , Then with Scotland first begin." For once the eagle England being in prey , To her unguarded nest the weasel Scot Comes sneaking and so sucks her princely eggs , Playing the mouse in absence of the cat , To 'tame and havoc more than she can eat .
What's that good for ?
And will you rent our ancient love asunder To join with men in scorning your poor friend ?
Young boys and girls Are level now with men .
Why , she defies me Like Turk to Christian .
Thou art in a parlous state , shepherd .
Kill Claudio .
Be this the whetstone of your sword .
Thus answer I in the name of Benedick , But hear these ill news with the ears of Claudio .
It is not possible .
Beshrew me but I love her heartily .
Delay not , Caesar .
Jove , I thank thee !
What , household stuff ?
My mistress and her sister stays for you .
His father , though I say 't , is an honest exceeding poor man and , God be thanked , well to live .
Well met here .
This week he hath been heavy , sour , sad , And much different from the man he was .
I shall , my lord .
Thou , my slave , As thou report'st thyself , wast then her servant .
Consent to pay thee that I never had ? , Arrest me , foolish fellow , if thou dar'st .
What , shall I find you here ?
There's a bargain made .
She's busy , and she can not come ! " Is that an answer ?
Signior Lodovico ?
This is a devil , and no monster .
I pray you , then , in love and dear alliance , Let that one article rank with the rest , And thereupon give me your daughter .
Shut that , and 'twill out at the keyhole .
As much to him , else is his thanks too much .
God be with my old master .
I have no ambition To see a goodlier man .
A devil !
If you had known the virtue of the ring , Or half her worthiness that gave the ring , Or your own honor to contain the ring , You would not then have parted with the ring .
Yet I profess curing it by counsel .
It is so too .
Now , Iras , what think'st thou ?
Why , man , what is the matter ?
Let me sit down .
Oh , thou wilt speak again of banishment .
I am very glad to see you .
Saw you anything ?
Let him take thee And hoist thee up to the shouting plebeians !
Is Signior Lucentio within , sir ?
What means your grace ?
Accursed , unhappy , wretched , hateful day !
He sought my life , But lately , very late .
You should then have accosted her , and with some excellent jests , fire-new from the mint , you should have banged the youth into dumbness .
Our dinner done and he not coming thither , I went to seek him .
If more thou dost perceive , let me know more .
I'll attend her here And woo her with some spirit when she comes .
My Lord of Norfolk , Here , most gracious liege .
Sojourn in Mantua .
Do you triumph ?
What should I say to you ?
They call for dates and quinces in the pastry .
Good grandam , tell us , is our father dead ?
His Honor and myself are at the one , And at the other is my good friend Catesby , Where nothing can proceed that toucheth us Whereof I shall not have intelligence .
Sure he hath killed his wife .
Beware the ides of March .
Two deep enemies , Foes to my rest , and my sweet sleep's disturbers , Are they that I would have thee deal upon .
Thither will I invite the duke and all's contented followers .
I hope so , Lepidus .
Do you think I meant country matters ?
Peace !
Give me my armor .
I would have him nine years a-killing .
And weep ye now , seeing she is advanced Above the clouds , as high as heaven itself ?
And thane of Cawdor too : went it not so ?
I was told that by one that knows him better than you .
Hamlet , thou art slain .
But life itself , my wife , and all the world Are not with me esteemed above thy life .
Madam , with all my heart .
By two o'clock I will be with thee again .
But small to greater matters must give way .
When they shall see The face of Caesar , they are vanished .
Banquo , thy soul's flight , If it find heaven , must find it out tonight .
I do beseech ye , if you bear me hard , Now , whilst your purpled hands do reek and smoke , Fulfill your pleasure .
You tell us the manner of the wrestling .
I am ashamed I did yield to them .
He was the wretched'st thing when he was young , So long a-growing and so leisurely , That if this rule were true , he should be gracious .
Come , blade , my breast imbrue .
Oh , temperance , lady !
You sulfurous and thought-executing fires , Vaunt-couriers of oak-cleaving thunderbolts , Singe my white head !
If thou takest more Or less than a just pound , be it but so much As makes it light or heavy in the substance Or the division of the twentieth part Of one poor scruple , nay , if the scale do turn But in the estimation of a hair , Thou diest and all thy goods are confiscate .
Go comfort your cousin .
What is amiss ?
Their defeat Does by their own insinuation grow .
The time to come .
If it assume my noble father's person , I'll speak to it , though Hell itself should gape And bid me hold my peace .
Why came I hither but to that intent ?
He hath been in unusual pleasure , and Sent forth great largess to your offices .
I take pleasure in singing , sir .
Then is the world one .
Write to me very shortly , And you shall understand from me her mind .
Fears and scruples shake us .
Every hour He flashes into one gross crime or other That sets us all at odds .
Which is the lady I must seize upon ?
Friend Launcelot , what's the news ?
Catesby .
Take that of me , my friend , who have the power To seal th ' accuser's lips .
I shall be constrained in 't to call thee knave , knight .
Faith , once or twice she heaved the name of "father" Pantingly forth as if it pressed her heart , Cried , "Sisters , sisters !
But hast thou yet latched the Athenian's eyes With the love juice , as I did bid thee do ?
I'll have this crown of mine cut from my shoulders Before I'll see the crown so foul misplaced .
Suffolk first died , and York , all haggled over , Comes to him where in gore he lay insteeped And takes him by the beard , kisses the gashes That bloodily did yawn upon his face .
This is thy office .
If 'twere not she , I can not tell who told me .
Humbly on my knee I crave your blessing .
Round , even to faultiness .
Good Lord , how bright and goodly shines the moon !
And to see how he prizes the foolish woman your wife !
Out of my sight !
Sweet lady , ho , ho .
All's but naught .
Hast thou not a word of joy ?
Good my liege , Peace , Kent .
Oh , no , good Kate .
Oh , out of that "no hope" What great hope have you !
Yonder , sir , he walks .
Why should he follow ?
Thou hast mettle enough in thee to kill care .
Come to what is important in 't .
For the best turn i' th' bed .
For gazing on your beams , fair sun , being by .
I will so .
And there she shall at Friar Lawrence ' cell Be shrived and married .
Thou saidst , Oh , it comes o'er my memory , As doth the raven o'er the infectious house , Boding to all , he had my handkerchief .
No , rather I will go to Benedick And counsel him to fight against his passion ; And truly I'll devise some honest slanders To stain my cousin with .
No , alas , I found it And I did give 't my husband .
Do it not with poison .
No , heavens forfend , I would not kill thy soul !
But , as you say , sir , let your bounty take a nap , I will awake it anon .
The consequence is , then , thy jealous fits Have scared thy husband from the use of wits .
Do not learn of him , Emilia , though he be thy husband .
O , belike his majesty hath some intent That you shall be new christened in the Tower .
We'll not run , Monsieur Monster .
I will neither be faced nor braved .
I know it pleaseth neither of us well .
Go , Pindarus , get higher on that hill .
Cleopatra , Why should I think you can be mine , and true , Though you in swearing shake the throned gods , Who have been false to Fulvia ?
Look , sir , I bleed .
What will become of this ?
What , and stake down ?
Go armed .
Not sad , my lord .
Good my friends , consider You are my guests .
And you must cut this flesh from off his breast .
You must not think I am so simple but I know the devil himself will not eat a woman .
Tis yours , and we , Your scutcheons and your signs of conquest , shall Hang in what place you please .
Good morrow , Caesar .
Leonato , stand I here ?
In mine eye she is the sweetest lady that ever I looked on .
Come , tailor , let us see 't .
The weary way hath made you melancholy .
Can Fulvia die ?
What do I fear ?
For if the sun breed maggots in a dead dog , being a good kissing carrion , Have you a daughter ?

Madam , with much ado .
I pray you , let it stand .
A blank , my lord .
I had forgot , three months .
Thou wilt write to Antony ?
Oh , ay , Curtis , ay , and therefore fire , fire .
Signor Antonio , many a time and oft In the Rialto you have rated me About my moneys and my usances .
And joy comes well in such a needy time .
What is your pleasure , madam ?
Well , sir .
O horror , horror , horror !
Down with the Montagues !
They are entirely welcome .
Hope I may choose , sir .
Name Cleopatra as she is called in Rome .
I do now let loose my opinion , hold it no longer : this is no fish , but an islander that hath lately suffered by a thunderbolt .
I must talk a word with you .
Let's withdraw , my lord .
From France there comes a power Into this scattered kingdom , who already , Wise in our negligence , have secret feet In some of our best ports and are at point To show their open banner .
They fell together all , as by consent .
Was not that Cassio parted from my wife ?
Why , 'tis a cockle or a walnut shell , A knack , a toy , a trick , a baby's cap .
Is 't possible you will away tonight ?
My leg is cut in two .
I would eat his heart in the marketplace .
Say it , Othello .
And you .
How , my pretty York ?
He's not thy kinsman .
O ceremony , show me but thy worth !
Come , sir , to dinner. , Dromio , keep the gate .
I doubt not of your wisdom .
Art thou a churchman ?
So should the murdered look , and so should I , Pierced through the heart with your stern cruelty .
Not altogether so , sir .
I will be heard .
Ah , Juliet , if the measure of thy joy Be heaped like mine , and that thy skill be more To blazon it , then sweeten with thy breath This neighbor air , and let rich music's tongue Unfold the imagined happiness that both Receive in either by this dear encounter .
But , for mine own part , it was Greek to me .
Here's a madman will murder me .
To him will I .
If he please To give me conquered Egypt for my son , He gives me so much of mine own as I Will kneel to him with thanks .
What wound did ever heal but by degrees ?
If it prove lawful prize , he's made for ever .
My daughter tells us all .
I pity thy complaining .
Do not bid me speak .
Come .
Death is the fairest cover for her shame That may be wished for .
But stay awhile .
I give him curses , yet he gives me love .
Whilst you were here o'erwhelmed with your grief , A passion most resulting such a man , Cassio came hither .
As with the meat , some undeserved fault I'll find about the making of the bed , And here I'll fling the pillow , there the bolster , This way the coverlet , another way the sheets .
His father was called Philip of Macedon , as I take it .
I'll tell you , there is good men porn at Monmouth .
And so , good Capulet , which name I tender As dearly as my own , be satisfied .
Will not King Richard let me speak with him ?
Whither indeed , before thy here-approach , Old Siward , with ten thousand warlike men , Already at a point , was setting forth .
Complain unto the Duke of this indignity .
Let's make us med'cines of our great revenge , To cure this deadly grief .
Here it is , I think .
Put on your nightgown .
I did not see him since .
My cousin means Signor Benedick of Padua .
The dropsy drown this fool !
This night methinks is but the daylight sick .
Bid them all fly .
Come now , keep thine oath .
Are all thy conquests , glories , triumphs , spoils , Shrunk to this little measure ?
Tis now the very witching time of night , When churchyards yawn and hell itself breathes out Contagion to this world .
Nay , I will do so .
Tybalt would kill thee , But thou slew'st Tybalt , there art thou happy .
You lack a man's heart .
If you shall cleave to my consent , when 'tis , It shall make honor for you .
Tis not fit thus to obey him .
At last , a little shaking of mine arm And thrice his head thus waving up and down , He raised a sigh so piteous and profound As it did seem to shatter all his bulk And end his being .
If thou say so , villain , Thou kill'st thy mistress .
Therefore , Lord Constable , haste on Montjoy And let him say to England that we send To know what willing ransom he will give .
She has light by her continually .
Goblin , lead them up and down .
Tis double wrong to truant with your bed And let her read it in thy looks at board .
Are not these woods More free from peril than the envious court ?
Well , do it , and be brief .
No , faith , not a jot .
Truly , the lady fathers herself. , Be happy , lady , for you are like an honorable father .
Now Mercury endue thee with leasing , for thou speakest well of fools !
My parts , my title , and my perfect soul Shall manifest me rightly .
Worthily spoken , Maecenas .
My services which I have done the signiory Shall out-tongue his complaints .
And so say I .
My name is Mary , sir .
Is he not able to discharge the money ?
And discourse fustian with one's own shadow ?
Or I do forget myself ?
Why , this is not Lear .
His knights grow riotous , and himself upbraids us On every trifle .
Now art thou my lieutenant .
Will you know them then ?
This can not anger him .
Hence , horrible villain , or I'll spurn thine eyes Like balls before me !
Take thee that too .
Thou shalt be loggerhead. , Good faith , 'tis day .
I could be sad .
We have willing dames enough .
Tis monstrous .
I would we were well rid of this knavery .
Do as I bid thee .
Why , what are you ?
How have you made division of yourself ?
I see that thou art poor .
I will not take her on gift of any man .
These are now the fashion , and so berattle the common stages , so they call them , that many wearing rapiers are afraid of goose quills and dare scarce come thither .
Or do you but counterfeit ?
Tut , I have the best armor of the world .
Conscience , " say I , "you counsel well." "Fiend , " say I , "you counsel well." To be ruled by my conscience I should stay with the Jew my master , who , God bless the mark , is a kind of devil .
I would I were senseless , sir , that I might not feel your blows .
I shall not sleep in quiet at the Tower .
Then let your servants bring my husband forth .
Well this was Signor Benedick that said so .
Here comes the count .
Aye , sir .
I am a villain .
Nay , an you be a cursing hypocrite once , you must be looked to .
He is not here , so please your lordship , that should sing it .
For a little Follow , and do me service .
I have yet Room for six scotches more .
He doth indeed show some sparks that are like wit .
Is he come ?
Thou torturest me , Tubal .
I know him to be valiant .
Though I wish thy death , I will not be the executioner .
Henceforth I never will be Romeo .
Holy Saint Francis , what a change is here !
The king's son , Ferdinand , With hair up-staring , then , like reeds , not hair , Was the first man that leaped , cried , "Hell is empty And all the devils are here." Why , that's my spirit !
Here , sir !
They thus directed , we will follow In the main battle , whose puissance on either side Shall be well winged with our chiefest horse .
Give me the cups .
Most royal sir , Fleance is 'scaped .
Thy threats have no more strength than her weak prayers. , Helen , I love thee .
Why did he so ?
The moon shines bright .
She for an Edward weeps , and so do I ; I for a Clarence weep ; so doth not she .
No , if without more words you will get you hence .
If what he might he is not , I would to heaven he were !
Faith , no , as you may season it in the charge .
We do not come as minding to contest you , Our true intent is .
Let him thank me , that holp to send him thither , For he was fitter for that place than earth .
Faith , that was not so well .
Oh , I am slain !
Why , thou didst conclude hairy men plain dealers without wit .
We would have all such offenders so cut off , and we give express charge that in our marches through the country there be nothing compelled from the villages , nothing taken but paid for , none of the French upbraided or abused in disdainful language ; for when lenity and cruelty play for a kingdom , the gentler gamester is the soonest winner .
I came from Corinth , my most gracious lord .
Thou fond mad man , hear me a little speak .
Things base and vile , holding no quantity , Love can transpose to form and dignity .
And for mine own part , I durst not laugh for fear of opening my lips and receiving the bad air .
Will you go to them ?
Sometimes from her eyes I did receive fair speechless messages .
Caesar sends greeting to the Queen of Egypt , And bids thee study on what fair demands Thou mean'st to have him grant thee .
What , have you dined at home ?
Tis exactly valued , Not petty things admitted .
Now , by my maidenhead at twelve year old I bade her come .
A very weak monster .
But if I had wit enough to get out of this wood , I have enough to serve mine own turn .
If every of your wishes had a womb , And fertile every wish , a million .
I have a head , sir , that will find out logs , And never trouble Peter for the matter .
Follow me .
Let Rome be thus informed .
I had rather be a toad And live upon the vapor of a dungeon Than keep a corner in the thing I love For others ' uses .
O inhuman dog !
All hail , Macbeth !
Well then , I know thee .
Come , we'll have him in a dark room and bound .
Is it within reason and compass ?
Fetch me the handkerchief , my mind misgives .
But next day I told him of myself , which was as much As to have asked him pardon .
Very easily possible .
She has robbed me of my sword .

Would all the world but he had quite forsworn !
I do assure you , 'tis against my will .
Nor know I aught But that he's well and will be shortly here .
Cassius , Be not deceived .

He that is giddy thinks the world turns round .
Forget to think of her .

Perchance ?
No , Cassius , no .
Oh , here it is .
I am so much a fool , should I stay longer It would be my disgrace and your discomfort .
Ay .
Only to despite them , I will endeavor anything .
Now sits the wind fair , and we will aboard .
For God's sake , a pot of small ale .
Which of you trembles not that looks on me ?
All strange and terrible events are welcome , But comforts we despise .

Give me faith , say I .
To whom , my lord ?
Too old by heaven .
No , faith , I'll not stay a jot longer .
I shall have glory by this losing day More than Octavius and Mark Antony By this vile conquest shall attain unto .
Rise , and lend thine ear .
And what says My concealed lady to our canceled love ?
Pardon , my lord .
Sweet , sweet , sweet Nurse , tell me , what says my love ?
Do me no foul play , friends .
Pray you , be careful .
There , take it to you , trenchers , cups , and all !
He is , indeed , sir , the most skillful , bloody , and fatal opposite that you could possibly have found in any part of Illyria .
Aunchient Pistol , I do partly understand your meaning .
Dost thou mean the crown ?
But the great one that goes up the hill , let him draw thee after .
My spirits are nimble .
I am gone , though I am here .
That's most certain , and with you .
How now ?
Rosalind of a better leer than you .
A quarrel , but nothing wherefore .
You say you do not know the lady's mind .
Wisdom !
Nothing .
If thou say so , withdraw and prove it too .
Who you are and what you would are out of my welkin , I might say "element , " but the word is overworn .
And if it sort not well , you may conceal her , As best befits her wounded reputation , In some reclusive and religious life , Out of all eyes , tongues , minds , and injuries .
Therefore in my presence still smile , dear my sweet , I prithee."
Tear him to pieces .
Now , by my holidam , here comes Katherina !
You shall not choose but drink before you go .
Thou shalt be pinched As thick as honeycomb , each pinch more stinging Than bees that made 'em .
Go .
What manner of man ?
Alas , I rather hate myself For hateful deeds committed by myself .
I thank thee .
Tis too bad , too bad .
Sirrah young gamester , your father were a fool To give thee all and in his waning age Set foot under thy table .
And what said he ?
No .
Let me enjoy my private .
Therefore he hates me .
There is a litter ready .
When shall we three meet again ?
Oh , mickle is the powerful grace that lies In herbs , plants , stones , and their true qualities .
And sometime lurk I in a gossip's bowl In very likeness of a roasted crab , And when she drinks , against her lips I bob And on her withered dewlap pour the ale .
O hard condition , Twin-born with greatness , subject to the breath Of every fool , whose sense no more can feel But his own wringing .
Set me the stoups of wine upon that table .
He says so .
Or rather , do thy pleasure .
I'll have no speaking .
If I should say , I saw such islanders , For , certes , these are people of the island , Who , though they are of monstrous shape , yet note , Their manners are more gentle-kind than of Our human generation you shall find Many , nay , almost any .
Wherein hath Caesar thus deserved your loves ?
Oh , widow Dido ?
From Athens is her house remote seven leagues , And she respects me as her only son .
Besides , she uses me with a more exalted respect than anyone else that follows her .
If you go on thus , you will kill yourself , And 'tis not wisdom thus to second grief Against yourself .
Your wife would give you little thanks for that If she were by to hear you make the offer .
Tomorrow I intend to hunt again .
Just , just ; and the men do sympathize with the mastiffs in robustious and rough coming on , leaving their wits with their wives .
I can not hide what I am .
Women's gentle brain Could not drop forth such giant-rude invention , Such Ethiop words , blacker in their effect Than in their countenance .
The more fool you for laying on my duty .
Do you not see that I am out of breath ?
Is it so long ? , Call forth the holy father .
God and your arms be praised , victorious friends !
False to me ?
What is thy name ?
Then certifies your Lordship that this night He dreamt the boar had razed his helm Besides , he says there are two councils kept , And that may be determined at the one Which may make you and him to rue at th ' other .
The article of my oath ?
No , unpin me here .
Tis he .
The fault's your own .
Then leave him out .
And what your Highness suffered under that shape , I beseech you take it for your own fault and not mine , for , had you been as I took you for , I made no offense .
It is Captain Macmorris , is it not ?
It is no mean happiness , therefore , to be seated in the mean .
This is the silliest stuff that ever I heard .
Why , do not your courtier's hands sweat ?
Thou dost not mark me .
Note him , Note him , good Charmian , 'tis the man , but note him .
They say he cried out of sack .
Rumor it abroad That Anne my wife is very grievous sick .
Hence , Lest that th ' infection of his fortune take Like hold on thee .
Brought you Caesar home ?
I wot well where he is .
My lord , you nod .
O woeful day , O woeful day !
Confirmed , confirmed !
This is no place , this house is but a butchery .
Their names are pricked .
Swear your love .
My brother never Did urge me in his act .
My uncle ?
O nature , what hadst thou to do in hell When thou didst bower the spirit of a fiend In moral paradise of such sweet flesh ?
Not for all this land Would I be guilty of so deep a sin .
Good troth , you do me wrong , good sooth , you do , In such disdainful manner me to woo .
May I be bold To think these spirits ?
But to my mind , though I am native here And to the manner born , it is a custom More honored in the breach than the observance .
For , of my heart , those charms , thine eyes , are blotted .
I doubt it not , sir , but you will curse your wooing. , Neighbor , this is a gift very grateful , I am sure of it .
What says that fool of Hagar's offspring , ha ?
Now sir , be judge yourself , Whether I in any just term am affined To love the Moor .
Is this the Prince ?
Oft have I heard of sanctuary men , But sanctuary children , ne'er till now .
The king hath note of all that they intend , By interception which they dream not of .
I am th ' unhappy subject of these quarrels .
Go off .
I am glad to see you well. , Horatio ?
Those his goodly eyes , That o'er the files and musters of the war Have glowed like plated Mars , now bend , now turn The office and devotion of their view Upon a tawny front .
From my house , if I had it , The sixth of July .
For a taste : If a hart do lack a hind , Let him seek out Rosalind .
Sir , March is wasted fifteen days .
Yea , from the table of my memory I'll wipe away all trivial fond records , All saws of books , all forms , all pressures past That youth and observation copied there , And thy commandment all alone shall live Within the book and volume of my brain , Unmixed with baser matter .
That I might sleep out this great gap of time My Antony is away .
And she's fair I love .
I say , there is no darkness but ignorance , in which thou art more puzzled than the Egyptians in their fog .
Meet me and Gratiano At Gratiano's lodging some hour hence .
You have stayed me in a happy hour .
By heaven , that should be my handkerchief !
Face not me .
They are winged .
Why , you were with him , were you not ?
Is it they ?
I did her wrong , Canst tell how an oyster makes his shell ?
Say , what ?
But you , my honorable lords , may name the time , And in the duke's behalf I'll give my voice , Which I presume he'll take in gentle part .
A plague upon this howling !
A solemn air and the best comforter To an unsettled fancy cure thy brains , Now useless , boiled within thy skull. , There stand , For you are spell-stopped. , Mine eyes , ev'n sociable to the show of thine , Fall fellowly drops .
Of all the wonders that I yet have heard , It seems to me most strange that men should fear , Seeing that death , a necessary end , Will come when it will come .
Come on , then .
I'll have the work ta'en out And give 't Iago .
As thou got'st Milan , I'll come by Naples .
That you have wronged me doth appear in this : You have condemned and noted Lucius Pella For taking bribes here of the Sardians , Wherein my letters , praying on his side Because I knew the man , were slighted off .
Sweet saint , for charity , be not so curst .
I'll slit the villain's nose that would have sent me to the jail .
If I could bid the fifth welcome with so good a heart as I can bid the other four farewell , I should be glad of his approach .
Best of comfort , And ever welcome to us .
Go thy ways , wench .
It must appear in other ways than words , Therefore I scant this breathing courtesy .
He dares not come there for the candle .
If she will stir hither , I shall seem to notify unto her .
Come , come , dispatch .
Why , man , he doth bestride the narrow world Like a Colossus , and we petty men Walk under his huge legs and peep about To find ourselves dishonorable graves .
Be 't so .
What , I say ?
Nay , but this dotage of our general's O'erflows the measure .
Fellow , come from the throng .
His dishonesty appears in leaving his friend here in necessity and denying him .
Two such opposed kings encamp them still , In man as well as herbs , grace and rude will .
Pray you , sit down , For now we sit to chat as well as eat .
Then open not thy lips .
Ha ' to thee , lad !
You will be schoolmaster And undertake the teaching of the maid : That's your device .
A little , by your favor .
Why , mistress , sure my master is horn mad .
Tis called the evil .
Hid'st thou that forehead with a golden crown Where should be branded , if that right were right , The slaughter of the prince that owed that crown And the dire death of my poor sons and brothers ?
A wandering knight ?
Good time of day unto my gracious lord .
There's the cunning of it .
I tell thee true .
Please it your Grace lead on ?
Parted you in good terms ?
In private ?
I would speak with Clarence , and I came hither on my legs .
Is that the law ?
Here's a spirit .
How if I answer "No" ?
Nay , she is worse ; she is the devil's dam , and here she comes in the habit of a light wench .
Everything is well .
It is my fashion , when I see a crab .
Belike you slew great number of his people ?
What's your will ?
Would she were hearsed at my foot and the ducats in her coffin !
You are idle , shallow things .
O Cassius , if you could But win the noble Brutus to our party , Be you content .
Sir , pardon me in what I have to say .
You might do much .
This not to do , So grace and mercy at your most need help you , Swear .
Ratcliffe , my lord , 'tis I .
Thus have I , Wall , my part discharged so .
Teach it but how , And thou shalt see how apt it is to learn Any hard lesson that may do thee good .
Alas , poor Romeo !
I might call him A thing divine , for nothing natural I ever saw so noble .
Therefore 'tis certain he was not ambitious .
What , not a whore ?
And bid her come hither .
In one voyage Did Claribel her husband find at Tunis ; And Ferdinand , her brother , found a wife Where he himself was lost ; Prospero , his dukedom In a poor isle ; and all of us , ourselves When no man was his own .
I would he had boarded me .
Do you hear ?
You all do know this mantle .
I have slept , my lord , already .
Not a soul But felt a fever of the mad and played Some tricks of desperation .
Seigneur Valentio and his cousin Tybalt ; Lucio and the lively Helena." A fair assembly .
Hear it not , Duncan , for it is a knell That summons thee to heaven or to hell .
Oh , what a rogue and peasant slave am I !
Who , I ?
Go , fetch me something : I'll break ope the gate .
Be curst and brief .
You have done that you should be sorry for .
Sirs , I will practice on this drunken man .
Ay ; and let none enter , lest I break your pate .
Anon , as patient as the female dove When that her golden couplets are disclosed , His silence will sit drooping .
For when thou gavest them the rod , and put'st down thine own breeches , Prithee , nuncle , keep a schoolmaster that can teach thy fool to lie .

Dear general , I never gave you cause .
What counterfeit did I give you ?
How am I then a villain To counsel Cassio to this parallel course , Directly to his good ?
The time has been That , when the brains were out , the man would die , And there an end .
Who goes there , ha ?
She dies for 't. , Eros , ho !
What , the chain ?

Nay , let him alone .
And sowing the kernels of it in the sea , bring forth more islands .
Gifts that God gives .
The story is extant , and writ in choice Italian .
Very well , my lord .
What I should think of this I can not tell , But this I think : there's no man is so vain That would refuse so fair an offered chain .
Up , my lords .
Then there's hope a great man's memory may outlive his life half a year .
Stay , gentle Helena .
Men's eyes were made to look and let them gaze .
Of what , lady ?
It is .
Sir , a word ere you go .
I have done my work ill , friends .
All may be well ; but if God sort it so , 'T is more than we deserve or I expect .
Madam , in happy time , what day is that ?
I will forestall their repair hither and say you are not fit .
Do you speak in the sick tune ?
She confesses it .
Father , what news ?
I'll tell thee how Beatrice praised thy wit he other day .
Wondrous heavy .
What's he That was not born of woman ?
A good epithet !

This is old .
What , Grumio !

An if the wind blow any way from shore , I will not harbor in this town tonight .
But fathers that bear bags Shall see their children kind .
We'll mend our dinner here .
Excellent .
He brings me liberty .
Not so happy , yet much happier .
Sometime I'd divide , And burn in many places .
Well then , take a good heart and counterfeit to be a man .
Well , sir , I'll bring you to our master Lear And leave you to attend him .
You may think I love you not .
Peace. , Who comes here ?
Would the night were come !
If we do meet again , we'll smile indeed .

No slander .
Antonio , as I heard in Genoa , What , what , what ?
You shall , Mark Antony .

And if on earth he do not merit it , In reason he should never come to heaven .
But in my conscience , sir , I do not care for you .
Neither can be enjoyed If both remain alive .

Well , sir , my mistress is the sweetest lady. , Lord , Lord !
I can not believe that in her .
Feed him with apricoks and dewberries , With purple grapes , green figs , and mulberries .
A beast , no more .
What night-rule now about this haunted grove ?
There is no woman's sides Can bide the beating of so strong a passion As love doth give my heart .
On such a full sea are we now afloat , And we must take the current when it serves Or lose our ventures .
Know you not the cause ?
Shall I descend ?
Tis fittest .
There I deny my land service .
Who's that ?
Tis pity of him .
No , Pompey , I have kept me from the cup .
A very honest-hearted fellow , and as poor as the king .
He loves me well , and I have given him reasons .
If I speak like myself in this , let him be whipped that first finds it so .
Caesar , all hail !
Found you no displeasure in him by word or countenance ?
None can be called deformed but the unkind .
What ish my nation ?
So haply are they friends to Antony .
How ?
Therefore I pray you That to our sister you do make return .
I grant I am a woman , but withal A woman that Lord Brutus took to wife .
Thou hast hit it .
Bid me farewell .
It was , as I have seen it in his life , A sable silvered .
I wish you all joy of the worm .
We have store to do 't , And they have earned the waste .
God defend me from these two !
Arm you , I pray you , to this speedy voyage .
And now to our French causes .
My lord , I claim the gift , my due by promise , For which your honor and your faith is pawned , Th ' earldom of Hereford and the movables Which you promised I shall possess .
Hence , get thee gone , and follow me no more .
What a pied ninny's this ! , Thou scurvy patch ! , I do beseech thy greatness , give him blows And take his bottle from him .
How do you , sir ?
I do not understand .
But , look you , Cassius , The angry spot doth glow on Caesar's brow , And all the rest look like a chidden train .
That , being mad herself , she's madly mated .
Do so , good Messala .
Minion , thou liest .
You have dancing shoes With nimble soles .
Whoe'er he be that in this foul proceeding Hath thus beguiled your daughter of herself And you of her , the bloody book of law You shall yourself read in the bitter letter , After your own sense , yea , though our proper son Stood in your action .
I'll end my exhortation after dinner .
Why , go to bed , and sleep .
You or any man living may be drunk at a time , man .
Why , he shall never wake until the great Judgment Day .

Tears seven times salt , Burn out the sense and virtue of mine eye !
They'll tell all .
To whose hands You have sent the lunatic king .
Here is the head of that ignoble traitor , The dangerous and unsuspected Hastings .
Like one of two contending in a prize That thinks he hath done well in people's eyes , Hearing applause and universal shout , Giddy in spirit , still gazing in a doubt Whether these pearls of praise be his or no , So , thrice fair lady , stand I even so , As doubtful whether what I see be true Until confirmed , signed , ratified by you .
You keep by land The legions and the horse whole , do you not ?
What's the matter ?
This morning , like the spirit of a youth That means to be of note , begins betimes .
Believe none of us .
Royal wench !

Good now , hold thy tongue .
Where shall we meet i ' th ' morning ?

Do you wish then that the gods had made me poetical ?
Have I , my lord ?
Look !
Then plainly know my heart's dear love is set On the fair daughter of rich Capulet .
Sure it is hers .
And that which spites me more than all these wants , He does it under name of perfect love , As who should say , if I should sleep or eat , 'Twere deadly sickness or else present death .
He forbids it , Being free from vainness and self-glorious pride , Giving full trophy , signal , and ostent Quite from himself , to God .
The concernancy , sir ?
Yes , bring me word , boy , if thy lord look well , For he went sickly forth .
Not so sick , my lord , As she is troubled with thick-coming fancies That keep her from her rest .

That will I , for I must bear answer back How you excuse my brother , Rosalind .
Thou liest .
In which regard ,
Well , sir , in brief , the gown is not for me .
This is Trebonius .
My master's a very Jew .
Kent banished thus ?
You will lose this wager , my lord .
And what will you do now ?
Proof enough to misuse the Prince , to vex Claudio , to undo Hero , and kill Leonato .
No hope that way is Another way so high a hope that even Ambition can not pierce a wink beyond , But doubt discovery there .
But this rough magic I here abjure , and when I have required Some heavenly music , which even now I do , To work mine end upon their senses that This airy charm is for , I'll break my staff , Bury it certain fathoms in the earth , And deeper than did ever plummet sound I'll drown my book .
That is because the traitor murderer lives .
Indeed , upon my sword , indeed .
Make good room .
Cassius from bondage will deliver Cassius .
And I beseech you come again tomorrow .
The bloody proclamation to escape , That followed me so near , O our lives ' sweetness ,
Hark !
Shall we be sundered ?
The sun will not be seen today .
Twenty crowns ?

I can not speak Any beginning to this peevish odds , And would in action glorious I had lost Those legs that brought me to a part of it .
The king hath granted every article , His daughter first , and , in sequel , all , According to their firm proposed natures .
Belike 'tis but a rumor .
Lucentio , gentle sir .
Seek him , Titinius , whilst I go to meet The noble Brutus , thrusting this report Into his ears .
The starry welkin cover thou anon With drooping fog as black as Acheron , And lead these testy rivals so astray As one come not within another's way .
Neither .
Hear me yet , good Shylock .
Be it so .
Nay , indeed if you had your eyes , you might fail of the knowing me .
This is Lucentio's house .
Three or four wenches where I stood cried , "Alas , good soul ! " and forgave him with all their hearts .

The wager thou hast won , and I will add Unto their losses twenty thousand crowns , Another dowry to another daughter , For she is changed as she had never been .
Ay , Celia , we stayed her for your sake .
All this is so , but what of this , my lord ?
None in the world , nor do I know the man .

Upon a lie seven times removed. , Bear your body more seeming , Audrey. , As thus , sir : I did dislike the cut of a certain courtier's beard .
O my poor Rosalind , whither wilt thou go ?
Therefore no marvel though Demetrius Do , as a monster , fly my presence thus .
This would have seemed a period To such as love not sorrow , but another To amplify too much would make much more And top extremity .
Wherefore !
Excellent good .
Do not talk to me , Emilia .
O , unpleasing news !
It is a man's office , but not yours .
Why , then , 'tis none to you , for there is nothing either good or bad , but thinking makes it so .
Gratiano !
Where's my fool , ho ?
Glance at my credit with Hippolyta , Didst thou not lead him through the glimmering night From Perigouna , whom he ravished ?
My Lord of Oxford , you , Sir William Brandon , And you , Sir Walter Herbert , stay with me .
True , my lord .
Therefore prepare to die .
Ha , it may be I go under that title because I am merry .
You stand amazed , But be of comfort .
The wisdom of your duty , fair Bianca , Hath cost me an hundred crowns since suppertime .

Ninus ' tomb , " man .
Sunday comes apace .
There's nothing in her yet .
More of this hereafter .
Goodman Verges , sir , speaks a little off the matter .
Art thou afeard To be the same in thine own act and valor As thou art in desire ?
Captain Macmorris , when there is more better opportunity to be required , look you , I will be so bold as to tell you I know the disciplines of war , and there is an end .
Call , good Mercutio .
Hand in hand with fairy grace Will we sing and bless this place .

For I am almost ready to dissolve , Hearing of this .
None at all .

Hail , King of Scotland !
I'll bring thee word Straight how 'tis like to go .
Help , ho !
Stand thee close , then , under this penthouse , for it drizzles rain , and I will , like a true drunkard , utter all to thee .
To his father , that so tenderly and entirely loves him .
Even just the sum that I do owe to you Is growing to me by Antipholus .

Let me see 'em .
Now my spirit is going .
The usurer hangs the cozener .
I'll pay thy pleasure then .
What comfortable hour canst thou name , That ever graced me in thy company ?
I have deceived even your very eyes .
Tis but a little way that I can bring you , For I attend here .
Stand , ho !
Twas a color he never liked .
Now , good sweet Nurse , O Lord , why look'st thou sad ?
The sun !
Follow me .
Yes , they have .
What soldiers , whey-face ?
Ay , madam .
I leave an arrant knave with your Worship , which I beseech your Worship to correct yourself , for the example of others .
How looked he ?
What work is here , Charmian ?
By any other house or person ?
Stay , then .
I do desire it with all my heart , and I hope it is no dishonest desire to desire to be a woman of the world .
As you shall prove us , praise us .
Had all his hairs been lives My great revenge had stomach for them all .
Pray ye , go .
I must with haste from hence .
Ay , by my troth , the case may be amended .
Idle old man That still would manage those authorities That he hath given away !
They will surely do us no harm .
I repent me much That so I harried him .
Sweet Prince , why speak not you ?

What is thy soul of adoration ?
Will you shog off ?
He wore his beaver up .
I'll make thee an example .
You forget yourself To hedge me in .
But we are spirits of another sort .
What had he done to make him fly the land ?
Now a little fire in a wild field were like an old lecher's heart , a small spark , all the rest on 's body cold .
I know no answer .
Carry him gently to my fairest chamber And hang it round with all my wanton pictures .
You have me , have you not ?
But , hark , I hear the footing of a man .
Here do you keep a hundred knights and squires , Men so disordered , so debauched and bold That this our court , infected with their manners , Shows like a riotous inn .
If you would conjure in her , you must make a circle ; if conjure up Love in her in his true likeness , he must appear naked and blind .

What might you think ?
There is ten thousand , Geese , villain ?
Draw together .

Fear not , Baptista , we will content you .
Give first admittance to th ' ambassadors .

Last night she slept not , nor tonight she shall not .
Pray you , away .
Therefore give me no counsel .
My necessaries are embarked .
I'll answer that .
I did not think , sir , to have met you here .
I serve the king , On whose employment I was sent to you .
Thou hast quarreled with a man for coughing in the street because he hath wakened thy dog that hath lain asleep in the sun .
If but as well I other accents borrow , That can my speech diffuse , my good intent May carry through itself to that full issue For which I razed my likeness .
All three Now marry in an instant .

Even so .
My purpose is , indeed , a horse of that color .
Tis here .
Company is coming here .
The sea , with such a storm as his bare head In hell-black night endured , would have buoyed up , And quenched the stelled fires .

Death , in guerdon of her wrongs , Gives her fame which never dies .
Scratch my head , Peaseblossom .
What mean your graces ?
Am I not stayed for , Cinna ?
The most exquisite Claudio ?
If you do love me you will find me out. , Nerissa and the rest , stand all aloof .
And they that are most galled with my folly , They most must laugh .
Advise your fellows so .
Sister , content you in my discontent. , Sir , to your pleasure humbly I subscribe .
The barbarous Scythian , Or he that makes his generation messes To gorge his appetite , shall to my bosom Be as well neighbored , pitied , and relieved As thou my sometime daughter .
Then I'll be brief .

Ay , too gentle .
Macbeth !
He .
I speak not this that you should bear a good opinion of my knowledge , insomuch I say I know you are .
Then , in God's name , march .
Farewell .
Grandam , this would have been a biting jest .
Go , write it in a martial hand .
For aught that I could ever read , Could ever hear by tale or history , The course of true love never did run smooth .
Thou liest .
Set we our squadrons on yond side o' th' hill , In eye of Caesar's battle , from which place We may the number of the ships behold And so proceed accordingly .

Look , with a spot I damn him .
My news shall be the fruit to that great feast .
Now follow , if thou darest , to try whose right , Of thine or mine , is most in Helena .
Will you give her o'er ?
No , no , I am as ugly as a bear , For beasts that meet me run away for fear .
Where is my mother ?
If you do stir abroad , go armed .
Where hast thou been , sister ?
Have you no more to say ?
O Isis , 'tis impossible .
You may as well do anything most hard , As seek to soften that , than which what's harder ? , His Jewish heart .

God and our innocence defend and guard us !
Be attentive .
What is he , Biondello ?
If this letter move him not , his legs can not .
Away , away , be gone .
Take heed o ' th ' foul fiend .
O vengeance !
Ay , widow Dido .
O life !
Now by my life , Old fools are babes again and must be used With checks as flatteries , when they are seen abused .
What hour now ?
Here's France and Burgundy , my noble lord .
Farewell .
If this young gentleman Have done offence , I take the fault on me .
Barren my wit ?
I have been to seek you .
This torture should be roared in dismal hell .
They clepe us drunkards and with swinish phrase Soil our addition .
But fish not with this melancholy bait For this fool gudgeon , this opinion. , Come , good Lorenzo. , Fare ye well awhile .
Why let it strike ?
Come , good Athenian .
Sola , sola !
By Isis , I will give thee bloody teeth If thou with Caesar paragon again My man of men .
I am but mad north-north-west .
Will they pursue the quality no longer than they can sing ?
Farewell .
He will not fight with me , Domitius ?
How is it , general ?
I do not , sir .
If their purgation did consist in words , They are as innocent as grace itself .
You are welcome .
Hast thou found my daughter ?
I'll help you , Sir Toby , because we'll be dressed together .
Dismayed not this our captains , Macbeth and Banquo ?
I pray you , sir , my ring or else the chain .
Where is he ?
Both our remedies Within thy help and holy physic lies .
Hail !
Thus then in brief : The valiant Paris seeks you for his love .

Caesar ?
Good morrow , Catesby. , You may jest on , but , by the Holy Rood , I do not like these several councils , I .
The worm of conscience still begnaw thy soul .
Pray you , avoid it .
I will send for him , and question him yourself .
To seek my uncle in the Forest of Arden .
The foul fiend bites my back .
Not a whit .
The queen your mother , in most great affliction of spirit , hath sent me to you .
Truly then I fear you are damned both by father and mother .
Away with him !
It much would please him That of his fortunes you should make a staff To lean upon .
A cup , closed in my true love's hand ?
I must to the barber's , monsieur , for methinks I am marvelous hairy about the face .
But , as I can learn , He hearkens after prophecies and dreams , And from the crossrow plucks the letter And says a wizard told him that by "G" His issue disinherited should be .
Doth she not count her blessed , Unworthy as she is , that we have wrought So worthy a gentleman to be her bride ?
Well , Jessica , go in .
Trouble us not .
Tis proper I obey him , but not now .
I go to take my stand To see him pass on to the Capitol .
But we have reason to cool our raging motions , our carnal stings , our unbitted lusts .
He can not be such a monster , Nor is not , sure .
And where the worser is predominant , Full soon the canker death eats up that plant .
Nay , I will give thee a kiss .
Thy conceit is nearer death than thy powers .
Who is so gross That can not see this palpable device ?
Come hither , Leonato .
Fare thee well , dame .
O my dear niece , welcome thou art to me , Even daughter , welcome in no less degree .
I once writ a sonnet in his praise and began thus : "Wonder of nature , " I have heard a sonnet begin so to one's mistress .
Is now become a god , and Cassius is A wretched creature and must bend his body If Caesar carelessly but nod on him .
How , my lord , I may be censured , that nature thus gives way to loyalty , something fears me to think of .
Mistress , Wilt thou still talk ?
If you can , your reason ?
Our good old friend , Lay comforts to your bosom , and bestow Your needful counsel to our business , Which craves the instant use .
Pale or red ?
Well , I know not What counts harsh Fortune casts upon my face , But in my bosom shall she never come To make my heart her vassal .
Go , and bring them .
Do it quickly .
I rest much bounden to you .
Thy mother's name is ominous to children .
They are all welcome .
For what is he they follow ?
But we will draw the curtain and show you the picture .
He knows not yet of his honorable fortune .
I dare not confess that lest I should compare with him in excellence , but to know a man well were to know himself .
Tis safer to be that which we destroy Than by destruction dwell in doubtful joy .
Not so , not so .
O dolt !
See" 't shalt thou never. , Fellows , hold the chair. , Upon these eyes of thine I'll set my foot .
Lead me on .
He speaks home , madam .
Let her have your voice .
Death , that hath ta'en her hence to make me wail , Ties up my tongue and will not let me speak .
Oh , heaven forgive me !
Poison , I see , hath been his timeless end. , O churl , drunk all , and left no friendly drop To help me after ?
They have made him drink alms-drink .
Tyrant , show thy face !
Let us now stay and see it .
I told him you were sick .
A most poor credulous monster. , Well drawn , monster , in good sooth !
Oh , heaven , how got she out ?
For she is wise , if I can judge of her .
And I trow this is his house .
Not for Cadwallader and all his goats .
Tis mightiest in the mightiest .
In the way of argument , look you , and friendly communication , partly to satisfy my opinion , and partly for the satisfaction , look you , of my mind , as touching the direction of the military discipline , that is the point .
Why , what's the matter ?
Give me .
Is it a true thing ?
If e'er thou wast thyself and these woes thine , Thou and these woes were all for Rosaline .
I grant indeed it hath not appeared , and your suspicion is not without wit and judgment .
Mine ear , I thank it , brought me to thy sound But why unkindly didst thou leave me so ?
Zounds , sir , you're robbed !
Space enough Have I in such a prison .
Hereafter , in a better world than this , I shall desire more love and knowledge of you .
What sayest thou now ?
Good Signior Angelo , you must excuse us all ; My wife is shrewish when I keep not hours .
Good husband , come home presently .
It weeps , it bleeds , and each new day a gash Is added to her wounds .
Romeo !
Then 'tis like the breath of an unfee'd lawyer .
Come , sit on me .
O my good master !
And another storm brewing , I hear it sing i ' th ' wind .
Methinks thy voice is altered , and thou speak'st In better phrase and matter than thou didst .
Alas , and woe !
The more I love , the more he hateth me .
Armed , my lord .
But do not so .
Sin from thy lips ?
But I must tell thee plainly , Claudio undergoes my challenge , and either I must shortly hear from him , or I will subscribe him a coward .
Thou shalt be lord of it and I'll serve thee .
Faith , we met and found the quarrel was upon the seventh cause .
Go but with me tonight , you shall see her chamber window entered , even the night before her wedding day .
My husband !
Best you safed the bringer Out of the host .
Well , I'll break in .
Wife , children , servants , all that could be found .
Do thou for him stand .
She that makes dainty , She , I'll swear , hath corns .
Her father is Baptista Minola , An affable and courteous gentleman .
You received no gold ?
I fight against thee ?
Here's that shall drive some of them to a noncome .
It is determined , not concluded yet ; But so it must be if the king miscarry .
I had rather have a handful or two of dried peas .
Tis a naughty night to swim in .
When I come where he calls , then he is gone .
Do it carefully. , And the noble and true-hearted Kent banished , his offense honesty !
True , sir .
Till Birnam Wood remove to Dunsinane I can not taint with fear .
Good thou , save me a piece of marchpane , and , as thou loves me , let the porter let in Susan Grindstone and Nell. , Antony and Potpan !
Tonight she is mewed up to her heaviness .
Follow , I pray you .
He followed you .
Not for the wide world .
And that were enough to hang us all .
One speech in it I chiefly loved .
I'll write straight to my sister To hold my very course .
Thy asses are gone about 'em .
Send him but hither and I'll fashion him .
Thou know'st not gold's effect .
I do not set my life in a pin's fee , And for my soul , what can it do to that , Being a thing immortal as itself ?
Good sir , be patient .
Tranio hits you now .
Why , you gave no gold to me !
Come with a thought .
Truly , my name is Cinna .
Make those that do offend you suffer too .
Wherefore ?
Pardon me , sweet one , even for the vows We made each other but so late ago .
Well , let him go .
I commanded the sleeves should be cut out and sewed up again , and that I'll prove upon thee , though thy little finger be armed in a thimble .
Against all rules of nature , and must be driven To find out practices of cunning hell Why this should be .
Now I begin : Imprimis , we came down a foul hill , my master riding behind my mistress , Both of one horse ?
Who talks within there ?
It is not lost , but what and if it were ?
These are but wild and whirling words , my lord .
Tell her my love , more noble than the world , Prizes not quantity of dirty lands ; The parts that fortune hath bestowed upon her , Tell her , I hold as giddily as fortune ; But 'tis that miracle and queen of gems That nature pranks her in attracts my soul .
Tis twenty year till then .
Why then , good night indeed .
You know no Centaur ?
Pray God it be , sir .
What a foolish duty call you this ?
What , would you make me mad ?
And liegemen to the Dane .
If this be known , Cassius or Caesar never shall turn back , For I will slay myself .
At land , thou know'st How much we do o'ercount thee .
O vassal !
My soul , and not my child !
If not , to say to thee that I shall die is true , but for thy love , by the Lord , no .
Yes , madam .
Worse and worse .
A piece of work that will make sick men whole .
Well , as time shall try .
I know the good king and queen have sent for you .
For 'tis most easy Th ' inclining Desdemona to subdue In any honest suit .
Sir , sir , be patient .
Since he hath got the jewel that I loved , And that which you did swear to keep for me , I will become as liberal as you .
He is a gentleman of a good house , and for his ransom he will give you two hundred crowns .
I will bite thee by the ear for that jest .
Nay , go not back .
Let me know .
No , my good lord .
If we are like you in the rest , we will resemble you in that .
Give to a gracious message An host of tongues , but let ill tidings tell Themselves when they be felt .
So he served the second , and so the third .
I'll not endure it .
Grieve not that I am fall'n to this for you , For herein Fortune shows herself more kind Than is her custom .
Which she shall purchase with still-lasting war .
Who calls so loud ?
And when I told thee he was of my counsel Of my whole course of wooing , thou cried'st "Indeed ? " And didst contract and purse thy brow together As if thou then hadst shut up in thy brain Some horrible conceit .
She lives .
They are wise and honorable , And will , no doubt , with reasons answer you .
Oh , that woman that can not make her fault her husband's occasion , let her never nurse her child herself , for she will breed it like a fool .
God bless you , sir .
Fie , fie !
Alas , good Kate , I will not burden thee , For knowing thee to be but young and light , Too light for such a swain as you to catch , And yet as heavy as my weight should be .
No messenger but thine , and all alone Tonight we'll wander through the streets and note The qualities of people .
Hath your grace ne'er a brother like you ?
We'll to th' river .
Follow my mother .
Ay , my good lord .
Fiery" ?
There's no clock in the forest .
I hourly learn A doctrine of obedience , and would gladly Look him i' th' face .
Well , good night .
Dost thou affect her , Claudio ?
If so , my eyes are oftener washed than hers .
For besides these beneficial news , it is the celebration of his nuptial .
And yesterday the bird of night did sit Even at noon-day upon the marketplace , Hooting and shrieking .
Had he a hand to write this , a heart and brain to breed it in ?
Not honestly , my lord , but so covertly that no dishonesty shall appear in me .
Yet that is but a crushed necessity , Since we have locks to safeguard necessaries And pretty traps to catch the petty thieves .
Thou know'st not me .
They shout for joy .
If thou speak'st false , Upon the next tree shall thou hang alive Till famine cling thee .
Roundly replied .
I have laid those sheets you bade me on the bed .
Here's the friar ready .
I know not .
How now , sir ?
This is kind I offer .
Tis too narrow for your mind .
Away , make haste .
O thou public commoner !
Well , sir , for want of other idleness , I'll bide your proof .
I have great comfort from this fellow .
But get thee back .
Ah , soldier !
Fortune , that arrant whore , Ne'er turns the key to th ' poor .
I say again , give out That Anne my queen is sick and like to die .
Now , fellow , What is there ?
Bid him set on his powers betimes before , And we will follow .
Gentle Mercutio , put thy rapier up .
Free , madam , no .
Perhaps some merchant hath invited him , And from the mart he's somewhere gone to dinner .
Prove that ever I lose more blood with love than I will get again with drinking , pick out mine eyes with a ballad-maker's pen and hang me up at the door of a brothel house for the sign of blind Cupid .
Next month with us .
Yet Edmund was beloved .
I warrant you , madam .
Weary sev'nnights nine times nine Shall he dwindle , peak and pine .
Thou runaway , thou coward , art thou fled ?
Now I feed myself With most delicious poison .
Ah , Desdemona , away , away , away !
Methinks she should not use a long one for such a Pyramus .
You are too hot .
Made you my guardians , my depositaries , But kept a reservation to be followed With such a number .
Croak not , black angel .
Take your time .
But soft !
I am called .
So do all thoughts .
This same should be the voice of Friar John .
Receive it so .
Where do you dwell ?
Save thee , Curan .
Shall I say to you , "Let them be free !
It was about to speak when the cock crew .
No , for I hold him to be unworthy of his place that does those things .
Work , work your thoughts , and therein see a siege .
Behold !
I would not see 't .
I dare not , dear , Dear my lord , pardon , I dare not , Lest I be taken .
O Tranio , till I found it to be true , I never thought it possible or likely .
Who is 't that cried ?
How sound is she asleep !
Nay , heaven doth know .
She that would be your wife now ran from you .
Brutus" will start a spirit as soon as "Caesar." Now in the names of all the gods at once , Upon what meat doth this our Caesar feed That he is grown so great ?
We shall , my lord , Perform what you command us .
Tis bitter cold , And I am sick at heart .
O , sixpence , that I had o ' Wednesday last To pay the saddler for my mistress ' crupper ?
I pitied thee , Took pains to make thee speak , taught thee each hour One thing or other .
And so far am I glad it so did sort , As this their jangling I esteem a sport .
I'll be at thy elbow .
Do so .
Tomorrow dinner , then ?
Nay , you must forget that .
Nothing can be made out of nothing .
Masters , the duke is coming from the temple , and there is two or three lords and ladies more married .
I am no fee'd post , lady .
Signior Hortensio , come you to part the fray ?
What ?
Here's goodly gear .
Whose tongue ?
Mere prattle without practice Is all his soldiership .
O time , thou must untangle this , not I .
Sir , I shall meet your wit in the career , an you charge it against me .
Tut , fear not me .
Ay , and twenty such .
The sweeter rest was mine .
Up , princes , and , with spirit of honor edged More sharper than your swords , hie to the field : Charles Delabreth , High Constable of France ; You dukes of Orleans , Bourbon , and of Berri , Alencon , Brabant , Bar , and Burgundy ; Jacques Chatillon , Rambures , Vaudemont , Beaumont , Grandpre , Roussi , and Faulconbridge , Foix , Lestrale , Bouciqualt , and Charolois ; High dukes , great princes , barons , lords , and knights , For your great seats now quit you of great shames .
I have heard that Julius Caesar Grew fat with feasting there .
By Jacob's staff , I swear , I have no mind of feasting forth tonight .
The date is out of such prolixity .
By which honor I dare not swear thou lovest me , yet my blood begins to flatter me that thou dost , notwithstanding the poor and untempering effect of my visage .
That is , to watch her , as we watch these kites That bate and beat and will not be obedient .
If he can not , let the botcher mend him .
How old are you , friend ?
Nothing but songs of death .
Madam , I am most apt to embrace your offer .
To the seaside straightway !
Your Highness told me I should post before .
Morton is fled to Richmond , And Buckingham , backed with the hardy Welshmen , Is in the field , and still his power increaseth .
Good words are better than bad strokes , Octavius .
Here , madam , at your service .
There was more foolery yet , if I could remember it .
I'll get me to a place more void , and there Speak to great Caesar as he comes along .
Tis time I should inform thee farther .
Besides , our hands are hard .
Pluck them asunder .
Tis very true .
Amen to that , sweet powers !
Which way ran he that killed Mercutio ?
Take from them now The sense of reck'ning ere th ' opposed numbers Pluck their hearts from them .
Give me your hand .
My soul is heavy , and I fain would sleep .
When he came to himself again , he said , if he had done or said anything amiss , he desired their worships to think it was his infirmity .
And I for Ganymede .
The bridegroom he is come already .
Will either of you bear me a challenge to him ?
Set on , and leave no ceremony out .
I will then give it you soundly .
If he be not in love with some woman , there is no believing old signs .
Hang him , Jack !
Even so lies she , Blubbering and weeping , weeping and blubbering .
What speech , my good lord ?
Commend me to thy mistress .
The violet smells to him as it doth to me .
Call you this "gamut" ?
Not life , but love in death .
I'll know thy thoughts .
Thou shouldst not have been old till thou hadst been wise .
I choose her for myself .
All myself ?
Stay with us .
Your crown's awry .
I will not .
Make haste .
Time travels in diverse paces with diverse persons .
Send for the man and ask him .
Here , Peter Quince .
You have too courtly a wit for me .
This thou shalt answer .
O , do not swear , my lord of Buckingham !
For I mine own gained knowledge should profane If I would time expend with such a snipe But for my sport and profit .
The wonder is he hath endured so long .
And so no doubt he is , my gracious madam .
Thy substance , valued at the highest rate , Can not amount unto a hundred marks ; Therefore by law thou art condemned to die .
It signs well , does it not ?
His ceremonies laid by , in his nakedness he appears but a man , and though his affections are higher mounted than ours , yet when they stoop , they stoop with the like wing .
Good Enobarbus , make yourself my guest Whilst you abide here .
Thus goes everyone to the world but I , and I am sunburnt .
Her name is Portia , nothing undervalued To Cato's daughter , Brutus ' Portia .
Why , then , build me thy fortunes upon the basis of valor .
Gentlemen both , we will not wake your patience .
Tis much. , Servants , leave me and her alone .
I'll send my prayers with him .
Where's that mongrel ?
Thou art the thing itself .
I know she is an irksome brawling scold .
Say 'tis not so , a province I will give thee And make thy fortunes proud .
I shall obey , my lord .
I was a fine fool to take it .
If you have any music that may not be heard , to 't again .
I wonder what it bodes .
How canst thou make me satisfaction ?
Upon my soul , a lie , a wicked lie .
The "why" is plain as way to parish church : He that a fool doth very wisely hit Doth very foolishly , although he smart , Not to seem senseless of the bob .
Ah , let be , let be !
But it would better fit your honor to change your mind .
False-boding woman , end thy frantic curse , Lest to thy harm thou move our patience .
Where is the king ?
And those that leave their valiant bones in France , Dying like men though buried in your dunghills , They shall be famed ; for there the sun shall greet them And draw their honors reeking up to heaven , Leaving their earthly parts to choke your clime ,
For my brother , I think he holds you well , and in dearness of heart hath holp to effect your ensuing marriage , surely suit ill spent and labor ill bestowed .
Thieves !
A most manly wit , Margaret , it will not hurt a woman .
Come , come .
But one word more , He will not be commanded .
Tis certain there's not a boy left alive , and the cowardly rascals that ran from the battle ha ' done this slaughter .
Turn from me then that noble countenance Wherein the worship of the whole world lies .
Saw who ?
Labio and Flavio , set our battles on .
You are welcome .
What means this lady ?
Antonio , I arrest thee at the suit of Count Orsino .
Why ,
It is , and wants but nomination .
Come , Vaughan .
Did this in Caesar seem ambitious ?
And welcome more common , for that's nothing but words .
His horse is slain , and all on foot he fights , Seeking for Richmond in the throat of death .
Was this ambition ?
This is some priory .
We'll hear it , Antony .
What is it that you would impart to me ?
She did show favor to the youth in your sight only to exasperate you , to awake your dormouse valor , to put fire in your heart and brimstone in your liver .
Perforce I must confess I thought you lord of more true gentleness .
And now who knows But you , Lorenzo , whether I am yours ?
Go thy ways to a nunnery .
Is not that he that lies upon the ground ?
Here's a good world the while .
Tis worse than murder To do upon respect such violent outrage .
Yea , noise ?
I would I were invisible , to catch the strong fellow by the leg .
O Antony , beg not your death of us .
Had you rather Caesar were living and die all slaves , than that Caesar were dead , to live all free men ?
And come with naked swords .
What , man ?
My mistress here lies murdered in her bed , Oh , heavens forfend !
O sir , you are too sure an augurer .
But , brother , I can tell you strange news that you yet dreamt not of .
Go , good partner , go , get you to Francis Seacole .
O sir , such a life with such a wife were strange !
I am a king , my masters , know you that ?
But what is your affair in Elsinore ?
Where is he , in his bed ?
Ay , marry , sir , now it begins to work .
Tis the infirmity of his age .
And therefore , since I can not prove a lover To entertain these fair well-spoken days , I am determined to prove a villain And hate the idle pleasures of these days .
No sovereignty , Yet he would be king on 't .
For he loves to hear That unicorns may be betrayed with trees , And bears with glasses , elephants with holes , Lions with toils , and men with flatterers .
By my faith , you have great reason to be sad .
I'll be with thee straight .
Who is 't that can inform me ?
If I be waspish , best beware my sting .
No ?
O cousin , cousin !
Oh , was she so ?
Anon , anon !
Some achieve greatness , " What sayest thou ?
Three words , dear Romeo , and good night indeed .
O coward conscience , how dost thou afflict me !
Who bids thee call ?
Do not you love me ?
I can not hear of any that did see her .
If thou dost I shall never love thee after .
Know you him ?
Hark , what noise is this ?
Goats and monkeys !
There is occasions and causes why and wherefore in all things .
She told her , while she kept it 'Twould make her amiable and subdue my father Entirely to her love , but if she lost it Or made gift of it , my father's eye Should hold her loathed and his spirits should hunt After new fancies .
Tis too late to go to bed now .
Marry , at the very next turning turn of no hand , but turn down indirectly to the Jew's house .
Nay , good my fellows , do not please sharp fate To grace it with your sorrows .
And so it is .
I shall remember .
In the same figure like the king that's dead .
Have you not set Lysander , as in scorn , To follow me and praise my eyes and face ?
Sweet Moon , I thank thee for thy sunny beams .
Who keeps her company ?
Alas , their love may be called appetite , No motion of the liver , but the palate , That suffer surfeit , cloyment , and revolt ; But mine is all as hungry as the sea , And can digest as much .
This interchange of love , I here protest , Upon my part shall be inviolable .
And so , his knell is knolled .
No , madam .
Will you be patient ?
On Tuesday noon , or night , or Wednesday morn .
Go in with me .
That courtesy would be uncleanly if courtiers were shepherds .
He is a good one , and his worthiness Does challenge much respect. , Come , Desdemona , Once more , well met at Cyprus .
Farewell , and if my fortune be not crost , I have a father , you a daughter , lost .
Edward Plantagenet , why art thou dead ?
And I am your Rosalind .
What do you mean ?
Father , I am glad you are come .
Nay , come again , Good Kate .
What are you there ?
Iago .
Welcome , Publius .
I think 'twas Soto that your Honor means .
Pronounce that sentence then on me , my liege .
Caesar , I shall .
In faith , lady , you have a merry heart .
Thou'dst thank me but a little for my counsel ; And yet I'll promise thee she shall be rich , And very rich .
We have not spoke us yet of torchbearers .
When were you wont to use my sister thus ?
Signior , it is the Moor .
Why , our battalia trebles that account .
Heavenly powers , restore him !
We wait upon your Grace .
Tell me , if your art Can tell so much : shall Banquo's issue ever Reign in this kingdom ?
Give 's your hand .
Speak yet .
Never in your life , I think , unless you see canary put me down .
We'll enter all together .
For once upon a raw and gusty day , The troubled Tiber chafing with her shores , Caesar said to me , "Darest thou , Cassius , now Leap in with me into this angry flood And swim to yonder point ? " Upon the word , Accoutred as I was , I plunged in And bade him follow .
Yes , gracious madam .
What should I say , sweet lady ?
Yet he looks successfully .
I was adored once too .
Her name is Katherina Minola , Renowned in Padua for her scolding tongue .
Look with thine ears .
Send to his brother .
But yet I run before my horse to market .
Once more unto the breach , dear friends , once more , Or close the wall up with our English dead !
Tis to be doubted , madam .
Is it my lady mother ?
Halfway down Hangs one that gathers samphire , dreadful trade !
Had we done so at first , we had droven them home With clouts about their heads .
I here do give thee that with all my heart Which , but thou hast already , with all my heart I would keep from thee .
That island of England breeds very valiant creatures .
Make thee a fortune from me .
Who was it ?
I can see a church by daylight .
Antonio .
I am half afeard Thou wilt say anon he is some kin to thee , Thou spend'st such high-day wit in praising him. , Come , come , Nerissa , for I long to see Quick Cupid's post that comes so mannerly .
I did hear him groan , Ay , and that tongue of his that bade the Romans Mark him and write his speeches in their books , "Alas , " it cried , "give me some drink , Titinius , " As a sick girl .
It is "music with her silver sound" because musicians have no gold for sounding .
Abate the edge of traitors , gracious Lord , That would reduce these bloody days again , And make poor England weep in streams of blood !
No more than from my soul I mourn for yours .
Men should be what they seem , Or those that be not , would they might seem none !
Have you writ down that they are none ?
Come they of noble family ?
So will you say when you have seen the sequel .
Is he not jealous ?
I will .
And yet no matter .
Tis true , my lords , he did .
I know not why he comes .
Are you good men and true ?
I , thus neglecting worldly ends , all dedicated To closeness and the bettering of my mind With that which , but by being so retired , O'erprized all popular rate , in my false brother Awaked an evil nature .
List his discourse of war , and you shall hear A fearful battle rendered you in music .
Committed ?
Never , my lord .
Your name , I pray you , friend ?
This was but as a fly by an eagle .
Come on .
He longs to see your head .
Why then , let fall Your horrible pleasure .
We will have such a prologue , and it shall be written in eight and six .
How may we try it further ?
My mistress with a monster is in love .
Who's here ?
Then , prophetlike , They hailed him father to a line of kings .
I will bite my thumb at them , which is a disgrace to them , if they bear it .
Would it not grieve a woman to be overmastered with a piece of valiant dust ?
Oh , on my soul , my cousin is belied !
My sweet Cassio !
These wise men that give fools money get themselves a good report , after fourteen years ' purchase .
She is never sad but when she sleeps , and not ever sad then , for I have heard my daughter say she hath often dreamed of unhappiness and waked herself with laughing .
What masque , what music ?
Because that , like a jack , thou keep'st the stroke Betwixt thy begging and my meditation .
What a fearful night is this !
Music i' th' air .
Good morrow , Catesby .
Truly , she must be given , or the marriage is not lawful .
Within these ten days if that thou beest found So near our public court as twenty miles , Thou diest for it .
Read it instantly .
Give me mine armor .
The gold I gave to Dromio is laid up Safe at the Centaur , and the heedful slave Is wandered forth , in care to seek me out .
My lord , my lord , I'll prove it on his body if he dare , Despite his nice fence and his active practice , His May of youth and bloom of lustihood .
Good even to my ghostly confessor .
No more of drowning , do you hear ?
Whip him .
No , my most wronged sister .
Romeo , away , be gone !
What think you of the Scottish lord , his neighbor ?
He hath the jewel of my life in hold , His youngest daughter , beautiful Bianca , And her withholds from me and other more , Suitors to her and rivals in my love , Supposing it a thing impossible , For those defects I have before rehearsed , That ever Katherina will be wooed .
Is it good e'en ?
What traitor hears me and says not "Amen ? " England hath long been mad and scarred herself .
How shall we then behold their natural tears ?
Let's ha ' 't , good Grumio .
But now , I tell thee , keep it to thyself , This day those enemies are put to death , And I in better state than e'er I was .
Who comes here ?
Come , you deceive yourself .
Touching our person , seek we no revenge , But we our kingdom's safety must so tender , Whose ruin you have sought , that to her laws We do deliver you .
Base is the slave that pays .
What , An advocate for an imposter ?
For me , I'll not be gone till I please myself .
Let him come in .
The greater therefore should our courage be .
Were I in England now , as once I was , and had but this fish painted , not a holiday fool there but would give a piece of silver .
Is it not strange , Canidius , That from Tarentum and Brundusium He could so quickly cut the Ionian sea And take in Toryne ? , You have heard on 't , sweet ?
Suffer love !
I'll tell thee , friend , I am almost mad myself .
Fair lady , do you think you have fools in hand ?
A thousand thousand !
But I'll see you soon .
But hollow men , like horses hot at hand , Make gallant show and promise of their mettle .
I am sped .
What is a traitor ?
Then I will kiss your lips , Kate .
Herald , save thou thy labor .
Thou shalt have nothing but the forfeiture To be so taken at thy peril , Jew .
Tis spoken well .
Lysander , whereto tends all this ?
Peace !
Most certain .
Poor living corse , closed in a dead man's tomb !
For mine own good , All causes shall give way .
There are things in this comedy of Pyramus and Thisbe that will never please .

I am sure he is in the fleet .
Get you to bed on th ' instant , I will be returned Forthwith .
Who ambles time withal ?
You English princes all , I do salute you .
I have seen you gleeking and galling at this gentleman twice or thrice .
Let us quit all And give our vineyards to a barbarous people .
We'll keep no great ado , a friend or two .
I do believe that these applauses are For some new honors that are heaped on Caesar .
Throw some of them at me .
So did you me , my liege .
Then take him up and manage well the jest .
Without his roe , like a dried herring .
If there be any impediment , I pray you discover it .
The Count is neither sad , nor sick , nor merry , nor well , but civil count , civil as an orange , and something of that jealous complexion .
Besides , it should appear that if he had The present money to discharge the Jew , He would not take it .
Now , by Apollo , Now , by Apollo , King , Thou swear'st thy gods in vain .
From both , my lord .

Longer , longer .
Come hither , Fabian .

Of whence , I pray ?
Well , well .

Rage , blow !
I do not like your faults .
Angels are bright still , though the brightest fell .
Put them to motion .

Since the youth will not be entreated , his own peril on his forwardness .
Write me a prologue , and let the prologue seem to say we will do no harm with our swords , and that Pyramus is not killed indeed .

But , good Laertes , Will you do this , keep close within your chamber .
March gently on to meet him .
He that plays the king shall be welcome .
What hast thou to do ? , Father , be quiet .
Nor I .
Was he not companion with the riotous knights That tend upon my father ?
What think'st thou ?
Godspeed , fair Helena !
Oh , that she knew she were !
I shall be saved by my husband .
This prince hath neither claimed it nor deserved it And therefore , in mine opinion , can not have it .
Stand up .
Tubal , a wealthy Hebrew of my tribe , Will furnish me .
Like a drowned man , a fool and a madman .
No .
The early village cock Hath twice done salutation to the morn .
Ah keeper , keeper , I have done those things , That now give evidence against my soul , For Edward's sake , and see how he requites me. , O God , if my deep prayers can not appease thee , But thou wilt be avenged on my misdeeds , Yet execute thy wrath in me alone !
Here was a Caesar !
What further woe conspires against mine age ?
Canst thou bring me to th ' party ?
Bless thee , Bottom , bless thee .
And indeed it takes From our achievements , though performed at height , The pith and marrow of our attribute .
Some say the Earth Was feverous and did shake .
We will have no telling .

That shall you know hereafter .
Come on , i ' God's name , once more toward our father's .

Poor Tom , thy horn is dry .
If you tickle us , do we not laugh ?
Did I not , fellow ?
This concurs directly with the letter .
Sir , He is with Caesar .
Where is my page ? , Go , villain , fetch a surgeon .

What say you to a neat's foot ?
Out of my sight ! , Be not offended , dear Cesario. , Rudesby , be gone !
Then must we look from his age to receive not alone the imperfections of long-engrafted condition , but therewithal the unruly waywardness that infirm and choleric years bring with them .

Madam , I will .
Take not her part .
Give me my veil .

Your heart is burst , you have lost half your soul .
You amaze me .
I take some joy to say you are because I would be talking of her .
Thou look'st like him that knows a warlike charge .
But were the day come , I should wish it dark , That I were couching with the doctor's clerk .
You can not better be employed , Bassanio , Than to live still and write mine epitaph .

An it had not fallen flat-long .
Now sir , this granted , as it is a most pregnant and unforced position , who stands so eminent in the degree of this fortune as Cassio does ?
I am not Barbason ; you can not conjure me .
Are you of good or evil ?
What , have you lost your wits ?
Come , away !

That is where we dined , Where Dowsabel did claim me for her husband .
Awake , I say !
A quarrel , ho , already ?
Here is more news .
Not so young , sir , to love a woman for singing , nor so old to dote on her for anything .
But there is , sir , an eyrie of children , little eyases , that cry out on the top of question and are most tyrannically clapped for 't .
Did he never make you laugh ?
Know him I shall , I am well sure of it .
Ay , with Cassio .
Or sleep I now and think I hear all this ?
A friend should bear his friend's infirmities , But Brutus makes mine greater than they are .
We are three of them .
Well said .
Hail !
Such and so finely bolted didst thou seem .
Haply your eye shall light upon some toy You have desire to purchase , and your store , I think , is not for idle markets , sir .
If he be , he knows how to turn his girdle .
I have heard my father name him .
They never meet but there's a skirmish of wit between them .
Would I might never O'ertake pursued success , but I do feel , By the rebound of yours , a grief that smites My very heart at root .
I know her answer .
No , it is Casca , one incorporate To our attempts .
Wisdom and goodness to the vile seem vile .
Why , I have eat none yet .
Invest me in my motley .
There's meaning in thy snores .
If thou wilt lend this money , lend it not As to thy friends , for when did friendship take A breed for barren metal of his friend ?
At such a time I'll loose my daughter to him .
Who dead ?
God give us leisure for these rites of love !
They are all but stomachs , and we all but food .
Flies may do this , but I from this must fly .
Kind sister , thanks .
I confess two sleeves .
This morning are they fled away and gone , And in their steads do ravens , crows , and kites Fly o'er our heads and downward look on us As we were sickly prey .
This day I breathed first .
O , be gone !
By your patience , no .
Come , let us to the castle .
The gentleman that danced with her told her she is much wronged by you .
Buzz , buzz .
Right , as snow in harvest .
If you would take the pains but to examine the wars of Pompey the Great , you shall find , I warrant you , that there is no tiddle toddle nor pibble babble in Pompey's camp .
Most constantly .
The Duke does greet you , general , And he requires your haste-post-haste appearance , Even on the instant .
Marry , beshrew my hand If it should give your age such cause of fear .
Yon ribaudred nag of Egypt , Whom leprosy o'ertake ! , i' th' midst o' th' fight , When vantage like a pair of twins appeared Both as the same , or rather ours the elder , The breeze upon her , like a cow in June , Hoists sails and flies .
Before the eyes of both our armies here , Which should perceive nothing but love from us , Let us not wrangle .
Here's to thy health .
Never .
Calling death "banishment , " Thou cutt'st my head off with a golden ax And smilest upon the stroke that murders me .
Yea , art thou there ?
Hurt him in eleven places .
What says the silver with her virgin hue ?
Let him that loves me strike me dead .
Let her be thine , for we Have no such daughter , nor shall ever see That face of hers again .
Do not laugh at me , For as I am a man , I think this lady To be my child Cordelia .
The night has been unruly .
But who comes here ?
They are afoot .
With his eyes full of anger .
No ?
Methinks they are such a gentle nation that , but for the mountain of mad flesh
Yet this I will not do , do how I can .
Lord , how art thou changed !
The plainsong" is most just , for humors do abound .
He raised the house with loud and coward cries .
Thou shall present me as an eunuch to him .
Take no note of him .
Fly And make your peace with Caesar .
And cries aloud , "Tarry , my cousin Suffolk .
Hast thou the pretty worm of Nilus there , That kills and pains not ?
You know sometimes he walks four hours together Here in the lobby .
I wish him joy of her .
Good morrow to you both .
Were it good , think you ?
But who dare tell her so ?
Fabian can scarce hold him yonder .
Oh , that I were a man for his sake !
But do not look for further recompense Than thine own gladness that thou art employed .
Here's our own hands against our hearts .
Sure we thank you .
You were best go in .
Let's all sink wi ' th ' king .
But , I'll warrant you , when I say so , she looks as pale as any clout in the versal world .
That's my noble master !
Get you to bed , faith .
The goodness of the night upon you , friends !
Where be thy tenants and thy followers ?
How appears the fight ?
For , by this light of heaven , I know not how I lost him .
Fare you well , Jessica .
My back a ' t ' other side .
I am bound to thee forever .
We learn no other but the confident tyrant Keeps still in Dunsinane and will endure Our setting down before 't .
I can not tell wat is dat .
And how does your content Tender your own good fortune ?
This is some fellow , Who , having been praised for bluntness , doth affect A saucy roughness and constrains the garb Quite from his nature .
Under the earth .
He named Sebastian .
O Antony , O thou Arabian bird !
Give me thy hand .
Or I will live Or bathe my dying honor in the blood Shall make it live again .
Tis not a time for private stomaching .
I will kiss thy lips .
If then they chanced to slack you , We could control them .
Iago is most honest .
Ay , madam .
Tell me that .
Orlando .
Signor , you are very near my brother in his love .
Ah , poor heart , he is so shaked of a burning quotidian tertian that it is most lamentable to behold .
Good hay , sweet hay , hath no fellow .
Nurse , commend me to thy lady and mistress .
A man is master of his liberty ; Time is their master , and when they see time They'll go or come .
Madam , undress you and come now to bed .
Do not break off so , For we may pity though not pardon thee .
If to have done the thing you gave in charge Beget your happiness , be happy then , For it is done .
Marry , that , I think , be young Petruchio .
Such comfort as do lusty young men feel When well-appareled April on the heel Of limping winter treads .
Go , go .
If thou beest as poor for a subject as he's for a king , thou'rt poor enough .
Why look you strange on me ?
I'll come to him .
Is Clarence dead ?
Com'st thou again for ransom ?
Thou art as wise as thou art beautiful .
Should you do so , my lord , My speech should fall into such vile success Which my thoughts aimed not at .
Wilt thou be gone ?
Therefore I promise ye I fear you .
And thus she means , videlicet , Asleep , my love ?
I am not Cinna the conspirator .
But where unbruised youth with unstuffed brain Doth couch his limbs , there golden sleep doth reign .
Thou say'st the king grows mad .
Ay , to a niggardly host and more sparing guest .
I dare not , sir .
With what addition ?
For the table , sir , it shall be served in .
Let him command , And to obey shall be in me remorse , What bloody business ever .
All that served Brutus , I will entertain them .
Why , bride !
Oh , I could weep My spirit from mine eyes .
Art thou thus boldened , man , by thy distress Or else a rude despiser of good manners , That in civility thou seem'st so empty ?
Drink , servant-monster , when I bid thee .
Monsieur the challenger , the Princess calls for you .
Of anything the image tell me that Hath kept with thy remembrance .
Why the King of France is so suddenly gone back know you the reason ?
It is no matter .
Save you , gentleman .
Did he confess it ?
Why dost thou spit at me ?
I am not gamesome .
A single thing , as I am now , that wonders To hear thee speak of Naples .
Proceed , proceed .
It is the most impenetrable cur That ever kept with men .
He shall stay my leisure .
This way , my lord .
She robs thee of thy name , And thou wilt show more bright and seem more virtuous When she is gone .
Hark .
Know'st thou his mind ?
If that may be then all is well .
Oh , couldst thou speak , That I might hear thee call great Caesar ass Unpolicied !
Why , he has three thousand ducats a year .
Your way is shorter .
Hear it apart .
Ay , my good lord .
Wherefore ?
Both , both , my lord. , This letter , madam , craves a speedy answer .
Why , she would hang on him As if increase of appetite had grown By what it fed on , and yet , within a month , Let me not think on 't .
The poop was beaten gold , Purple the sails , and so perfumed that The winds were lovesick with them .
If there be any in this assembly , any dear friend of Caesar's , to him I say that Brutus ' love to Caesar was no less than his .
Peace , Grumio .
No , sir , no jot .
While he was yet in Rome His power went out in such distractions as Beguiled all spies .
Answer me like men .
If you love her then , tomorrow wed her .
Near and on speedy foot .
Who ever knew the heavens menace so ?
I am agreed , and would I had given him the best horse inv Padua to begin his wooing that would thoroughly woo her , wed her , and bed her , and rid the house of her !
What features ?
Or else what follows ?
Then is Caesar and he forever knit together .
Go , bring them in. , And take your places , ladies .
Hold little faith , though thou hast too much fear .
Let it be so .
No matter whither , so you come not here .
There's the respect That makes calamity of so long life .
Nothing , but this is so .
But yesterday the word of Caesar might Have stood against the world .
Then is courtesy a turncoat .
No way but gentleness , gently , gently .
What offense , sweet Beatrice ?
What , Nurse , I say !
What , all so soon asleep ?
I have been your tenant and your father's tenant these fourscore years .
Ye say honestly .
Thou wilt quarrel with a man for cracking nuts , having no other reason but because thou hast hazel eyes .
There's no art To find the mind's construction in the face .
Well , let's away and say how much is done .
Well get you gone .
If you saw yourself with your eyes or knew yourself with your judgment , the fear of your adventure would counsel you to a more equal enterprise .
I know not , sir .
Go , one , and call the Jew into the court .
Welcome , ass .
Tongue , not a word .
I would I were at home .
Noses , ears , and lips .
You speak all your part at once , cues and all. , Pyramus , enter .
Poor Tom hath been scared out of his good wits .
And twenty of these puny lies I'll tell , That men shall swear I have discontinued school Above a twelvemonth .
Farewell , my dearest sister , fare thee well .
He stays upon your will .
Tranio , let's go .
Alas , she hath from France too long been chased , And all her husbandry doth lie on heaps , Corrupting in its own fertility .
Yet here she is allowed her virgin crants , Her maiden strewments , and the bringing home Of bell and burial .
I pray you , uncle , give me this dagger .
Speak .
Thou hast amazed me .
Be that thou know'st thou art , and then thou art As great as that thou fear'st .
Away , go !
Read the will .
Oh , excellent !
Thus do I ever make my fool my purse .
Why , she was dead ere thou wast born .
Is 't not Hortensio ?
An there be any matter of weight chances , call up me .
So may it be indeed .
O thou good Kent , how shall I live and work To match thy goodness ?
Casca , be sudden , for we fear prevention , Brutus , what shall be done ?
Let him answer me. , Come , follow me , boy .
Alexas !
Oh , villain !
Ay , marry , was 't , and he put it by thrice , every time gentler than other , and at every putting-by mine honest neighbors shouted .
And fixed his eyes upon you ?
I'll prove mine honor and mine honesty Against thee presently if thou dar'st stand .
I understand not what you mean by this .
Farewell .
A better instance , I say .
M" , why , that begins my name .
I pray , weep not .
Then let us both be sudden .
For our losses , his exchequer is too poor ; for th ' effusion of our blood , the muster of his kingdom too faint a number ; and for our disgrace , his own person , kneeling at our feet but a weak and worthless satisfaction .
If thou kill'st me , boy , thou shalt kill a man .
Where we lay , Our chimneys were blown down and , as they say , Lamentings heard i ' th ' air , strange screams of death , And prophesying with accents terrible Of dire combustion and confused events New hatched to the woeful time .
I have no power upon you .
Music , moody food Of us that trade in love .
Y'are a baggage , the Slys are no rogues .
But for the stuffing , well , we are all mortal .
If all the devils of hell be drawn in little , and Legion himself possessed him , yet I'll speak to him .
If he have the condition of a saint and the complexion of a devil , I had rather he should shrive me than wive me .
I thank thee , master .
Fear nothing .
An you part so , mistress , I would I might never draw sword again .
Away with him .
What's he ?
How now , my noble friend ?
Helen , to you our minds we will unfold .
This course I fittest choose , For forty ducats is too much to lose .
So call the field to rest , and let's away To part the glories of this happy day .
Caesar speaks .
Draw the curtain straight .
Nay , then you lie .
Where is my father and my mother , Nurse ?
No jewel is like Rosalind .
When we have matched our rackets to these balls , We will in France , by God's grace , play a set Shall strike his father's crown into the hazard .
Fall to 't yarely , or we run ourselves aground .
More , I prithee , more .
I may do that I shall be sorry for .
And cross-gartered ?
Shall we call in th ' ambassador , my liege ?
What would she have ?
Thus says my king : an if your father's Highness Do not , in grant of all demands at large , Sweeten the bitter mock you sent his Majesty , He'll call you to so hot an answer of it That caves and womby vaultages of France Shall chide your trespass and return your mock In second accent of his ordinance .
Thus was I , sleeping , by a brother's hand Of life , of crown , of queen at once dispatched , Cut off even in the blossoms of my sin ,
peace , this piece of toasted cheese will do 't .
Nay , do not pause ; for I did kill King Henry , But 'twas thy beauty that provoked me .
At five o'clock I shall receive the money for the same .
Minion , your dear lies dead , And your unblest fate hies .
O , know , my name is lost .
Madam , withdraw : the Prince , the Count , Signor Benedick , Don John , and all the gallants of the town are come to fetch you to church .
Here in the tent .
Swounds , show me what thou'lt do .
Better once than never , for never too late .
Behold the ordnance on their carriages , With fatal mouths gaping on girded Harfleur .
All hail , Macbeth !
Go ask his name. , If he be married .
If ever I live to see it , I will challenge it .
My lord of Orleans , and my Lord High Constable , you talk of horse and armor ?
Why art thou here , Come from the farthest step of India ?
Stand !
We love him highly And shall continue our graces towards him .
All which we pine for now .
Ah , my tender babes , My unblown flowers , new-appearing sweets , If yet your gentle souls fly in the air And be not fixed in doom perpetual , Hover about me with your airy wings And hear your mother's lamentation .
Drones hive not with me .
Faith , some certain dregs of conscience are yet within me .
Come , tailor , let us see these ornaments .
But who comes here ?
Had I before known this young man his son , I should have given him tears unto entreaties Ere he should thus have ventured .
Tell me .
And till the tears that she hath shed for thee Like envious floods o'errun her lovely face , She was the fairest creature in the world , And yet she is inferior to none .
He that shall see this day , and live old age , Will yearly on the vigil feast his neighbors And say , "Tomorrow is Saint Crispian." Then will he strip his sleeve and show his scars , And say , "These wounds I had on Crispin's day."
O wise and upright judge !
If our sport had gone forward , we had all been made men .
A tailor made thee .
Ay , that he did .
How long have you been a sectary astronomical ?
Come , sir .
Thy husband knew it all .
I am for thee straight .
The sun was not so true unto the day As he to me .
In this , though I can not be said to be a flattering honest man , it must not be denied but I am a plain-dealing villain .
My best way is to creep under his gaberdine .
Varrus and Claudio !
Why , Antony .
She should have died hereafter .
Such duty as the subject owes the prince , Even such a woman oweth to her husband .
I like it not .
But for your private satisfaction , Because I love you , I will let you know .
Did ever Dian so become a grove As Kate this chamber with her princely gait ?
It is a letter from my brother that I have not all o'er-read .
Are not you he ?
I shall break The cause of our expedience to the Queen And get her leave to part .
No , great king .
Your Honor wins bad humors .
Good night , Penthesilea .
Hoyday , a riddle !
Perchance he is not drown'd. , What think you , sailors ?
No , he's in Tartar limbo , worse than hell .
Is 't long or round ?
Where is the foolish knave I sent before ?
Thou dost speak masterly .
I will presently go learn their day of marriage .
A whole one , I .
But doth he know that I am in this forest and in man's apparel ?
Silence !
Hark , Tranio !
How now , my lord ?
Art thou his friend ?
It was my turquoise .
I thank you , sir .
Tis hatched , and shall be so .
Fulvia is dead .
You know me well , and herein spend but time To wind about my love with circumstance .
Peace , you were best .
I shall answer that better to the commonwealth than you can the getting up of the Negro's belly .
Let it not , Brutus .
Had I your tongues and eyes , I'd use them so That heaven's vault should crack .
Speak , man .
Yes , I have gained my experience .
Lechery , sir , it provokes and unprovokes .
Brown , madam , and her forehead As low as she would wish it .
How if they will not ?
Grave sir , hail !
A heavy sight !
He's in Arthur's bosom , if ever man went to Arthur's bosom .
Do not you chide .
I never thought him worse .
I say , O Caesar , Antony is dead .
How now , how now ?
Avaunt !
Oh , that estates , degrees and offices Were not derived corruptly , and that clear honor Were purchased by the merit of the wearer !
It waves me forth again .
Foul words is but foul wind , and foul wind is but foul breath , and foul breath is noisome .
That's a certain text .
Ay , if Messala will prefer me to you .
I'll give you a verse to this note that I made yesterday in despite of my invention .
Oh , coward that I am , to live so long To see my best friend ta'en before my face !
Macbeth ! , Had I three ears , I'd hear thee .
But , oh , vain boast !
How have you known the miseries of your father ?
In the great hand of God I stand , and thence Against the undivulged pretense I fight Of treasonous malice .
I will help you to 't .
Eyes , look your last .
Keep thy word .
I think he bought his doublet in Italy , his round hose in France , his bonnet in Germany , and his behavior everywhere .
What less than doomsday is the Prince's doom ?
And she is exceeding wise .
I myself .
I come to bury Caesar , not to praise him .
Fie , Demetrius !
We must obey the time .
Dead , I think. , Help , uncle ! , Hero , why , Hero !
I think I did , sir .
I know you not .
Very well .
If our father would sleep till I waked him , you should enjoy half his revenue forever , and live the beloved of your brother , Edgar." Hum , conspiracy ?
We'll wait upon your lordship .
Of the king's ship , The mariners , say how thou hast disposed , And all the rest o ' th ' fleet .
Now he importunes him To tell it o'er .
So to most noble Caesar .
Most happy !
A friend .
Before the time be out ?
And you by land .
Go with me to the vault .
When he is gone I would on great occasion speak with you .
Not in the legions Of horrid hell can come a devil more damned In evils to top Macbeth .
What noise is here ?
Did we , my lord ?
What is your tidings ?
Is it not hard , Nerissa , that I can not choose one nor refuse none ?
I am a fellow o ' th ' strangest mind i ' th ' world .
He seems to have a foreknowledge of that too , and therefore comes to speak with you .
Give you good night .
Then both , or one , or anything thou wilt .
A fine woman !
Yes , that thou didst .
I'll not believe 't .
He has broke my head across and has given Sir Toby a bloody coxcomb too .
The king , sir , Ay , sir , what of him ?
I'll rhyme you so eight years together , dinners and suppers and sleeping hours excepted .
As you are old and reverend , should be wise .
What needs this iterance , woman ?
Gentle Octavia , Let your best love draw to that point which seeks Best to preserve it .
It seemed she was a queen Over her passion , who , most rebel-like , Sought to be king o'er her .
What , is this so ?
Your face , my thane , is as a book where men May read strange matters .
I tell you , he that can lay hold of her Shall have the chinks .
Peace !
Here he is , here he is .
So the gods preserve thee !
And I as I love Hastings with my heart .
A very dishonest paltry boy , and more a coward than a hare .
If I could pray to move , prayers would move me .
Some villain hath done me wrong .
Be as ourself in Denmark. , Madam , come .
O , tell me , Friar , tell me , In what vile part of this anatomy Doth my name lodge ?
Proud , " and "I thank you , " and "I thank you not , " And yet "not proud" ?
What you have charged me with , that have I done , And more , much more .
For , since the mortal and intestine jars 'Twixt thy seditious countrymen and us , It hath in solemn synods been decreed Both by the Syracusians and ourselves , To admit no traffic to our adverse towns .
How say you to that , Malvolio ?
Goodly Lord , what a wit-snapper are you !
I shall answer for her .
I had forgot the reward .
Welcome to Rome .
Art thou so hasty ?
Hath he asked for me ?
And I am such a tender ass , if my hair do but tickle me , I must scratch .
But if these , As I am sure they do , bear fire enough To kindle cowards and to steel with valor The melting spirits of women , then , countrymen , What need we any spur but our own cause To prick us to redress ?
Farewell , good Strato .
Nothing that is so is so .
Thou art a strange fellow .
Lady , were you her bedfellow last night ?
Caesar's will ?
With drinking healths to my niece .
And mine , to eke out hers .
What , a feast , a feast ?
What news , Borachio ?
Master , knock the door hard .
It waves me still .
This wedding day Perhaps is but prolonged .
Let me see his face .
As I have life and honor , there shall he sit till noon .
Time calls upon 's .
What , dead , my dove ?
Never at quiet .
Well , let it strike .
If die , be brief , That our swift-winged souls may catch the king's , Or , like obedient subjects , follow him To his new kingdom of ne'er-changing night .
Believe me , I am not .
And so adieu , good madam .
Beloved Regan , Thy sister's naught .
Trust not Trebonius .
Methinks your maw , like mine , should be your clock , And strike you home without a messenger .
Tis true .
The knave counterfeits well .
By heavens , the duke shall know how slack you have been .
I'll be sworn , if thou be Launcelot , thou art mine own flesh and blood .
A touch , a touch , I do confess 't .
I heard nothing .
What's this ?
Ah , cut my lace asunder , That my pent heart may have some scope to beat , Or else I swoon with this dead-killing news !
We took this mattock and this spade from him As he was coming from this churchyard's side .
He is married ?
And , as thou badest me , In troops I have dispersed them 'bout the isle .
Sir , I shall study deserving .
So , it will make us mad .
Hold , take these keys , and fetch more spices , Nurse .
Oh , villain that I am !
The man that once did sell the lion's skin While the beast lived was killed with hunting him .
Ay , my lord .
No noise , and enter .
Welcome from Mantua .
Say that she frown ; I'll say she looks as clear As morning roses newly washed with dew .
I heard it not .
I am the king himself .
Service .
I will unto Venice To buy apparel 'gainst the wedding day .
Excellent well .
I tell thee , man , 'tis better with me now Than when thou met'st me last where now we meet .
Why , no , sir .
And now I do bethink me , it was she First told me thou wast mad , then camest in smiling , And in such forms which here were presupposed Upon thee in the letter .
Have patience , sir .
Therefore , my lords , omit no happy hour That may give furth'rance to our expedition ; For we have now no thought in us but France , Save those to God , that run before our business .
You must play Pyramus. , And Flute , you Thisbe .
Soft , sir !
Nor have I seen More that I may call men than you , good friend , And my dear father .
Let us be conjunctive in our revenge against him .
Get thee gone , And hire those horses .
Speak thou now .
Tis strange .
Tell me not , Friar , that thou hear'st of this , Unless thou tell me how I may prevent it .
Good night then , Casca .
Certainly my conscience will serve me to run from this Jew , my master .
The devil himself could not pronounce a title More hateful to mine ear .
Mock not , Enobarbus .
He's friends with Caesar , In state of health , thou say'st , and , thou say'st , free .
Why , man ?
Do you intend it ?
Out upon you !
Come , is the bride ready to go to church ?
You are to blame , my lord , to rate her so .
I gave my love a ring and made him swear Never to part with it .
O mischief , thou art swift To enter in the thoughts of desperate men !
Thou speak'st aright .
If in Naples I should report this now , would they believe me ?
We have consented to all terms of reason .
I am very proud , revengeful , ambitious , with more offences at my beck than I have thoughts to put them in , imagination to give them shape , or time to act them in .
O hell-kite !
mutinies , in countries discord , in palaces treason , and the bond cracked 'twixt son and father .
Damned as thou art , thou hast enchanted her !
Her only fault , and that is faults enough , Is that she is intolerable curst , And shrewd and froward , so beyond all measure That , were my state far worser than it is , I would not wed her for a mine of gold .
Be patient , for the prize I'll bring thee to Shall hoodwink this mischance .
Were 't my fitness To let these hands obey my blood , They are apt enough to dislocate and tear Thy flesh and bones .
Safer than trust too far .
By what rule , sir ?
Hark !
Till night , my lord , and all night too .
Why do you speak to me ?
Marry , they say my uncle grew so fast That he could gnaw a crust at two hours old .
My lord , whoever journeys to the prince , For God's sake let not us two at home .
That goldsmith there , were he not packed with her , Could witness it , for he was with me then , Who parted with me to go fetch a chain , Promising to bring it to the Porpentine , Where Balthasar and I did dine together .
I had rather hear my dog bark at a crow than a man swear he loves me .
I'll signify so much unto him straight .
Be thou a spirit of health or goblin damned , Bring with thee airs from heaven or blasts from hell , Be thy intents wicked or charitable , Thou comest in such a questionable shape That I will speak to thee .
It hath been taught us from the primal state That he which is was wished until he were , And the ebbed man , ne'er loved till ne'er worth love , Comes deared by being lacked .
So Fulvia told me .
I would rather have one of your father's getting .
This may prove food to my displeasure .
What serious contemplation are you in ?
O Pomfret , Pomfret !
Go release them , Ariel .
I hear my father coming .
They swore that you were well-nigh dead for me .
No more than my residing here at Rome Might be to you in Egypt .
And these does she apply for warnings and portents And evils imminent , and on her knee Hath begged that I will stay at home today .
What wert thou if the King of Naples heard thee ?
Who meets us here ?
O , then be bold to say Bassanio's dead !
Do you hear , you minion ?
How chance the roses there do fade so fast ?
Francis Flute , the bellows-mender ?
My brother he is in Elysium .
Thrice within this hour I saw him down , thrice up again and fighting .
I have done .
Thou hast me , if thou hast me , at the worst , and thou shalt wear me , if thou wear me , better and better .
See for the news .
Whate'er becomes of me , This is a soldier's kiss .
Vouchsafe to those that have not read the story That I may prompt them ; and of such as have , I humbly pray them to admit th ' excuse Of time , of numbers , and due course of things , Which can not in their huge and proper life Be here presented .
But thine doth fry .
A mellifluous voice , as I am true knight .
I know this , and thus I challenge it .
Thanks , you the valiant of this warlike isle That so approve the Moor .
It is my birthday .
Hold you , there is a groat to heal your pate .
Farewell , my coz .
Thou know'st that Banquo , and his Fleance , lives .
Give me answer to it .
Well , I say no .
For if thou dost intend Never so little show of love to her , Thou shalt aby it .
Marry , on Hero , the daughter and heir of Leonato .
And so the lion vanished .
Go then , my mother ; to thy daughter go .
Give me your neaf , Monsieur Mustardseed .
Mistress !
Who could refrain , That had a heart to love , and in that heart Courage to make 's love known ?
Some tender money to me ; some invite me ; Some other give me thanks for kindnesses ; Some offer me commodities to buy .
This it is : 'T is better that the enemy seek us .
Tomorrow , my lord .
Shall I entreat a word ?
Know you what Caesar means to do with me ?
My lord , from head to foot .
Thou know'st my lodging .
Harp not on that string , madam ; that is past .
