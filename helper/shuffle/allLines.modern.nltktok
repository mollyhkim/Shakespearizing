Goodbye .
In any case , Antonio assured the duke they weren't with Bassanio on his ship .
If it takes all the wine in my bottle , I'll cure him .
He ate at my house , but that doesn't make me nervous .
Beware of March 15th .
What an idiot that monster is !
My lord , his throat is cut .
Don't tempt me to suicide again .
Catesby .
Come with me now , and help me out .
You are an honest man .
Say something , man !
That's already been done , sir .
Well , praise the Lord you're ugly .
Think about it .
Yes .
Does he look as bright and handsome as the day we saw him wrestling ?
Her name is Katherina Minola , famous throughout Padua for her scolding tongue .
Give me that boy and I'll come with you .
Sorry , I'm all stuffed .
It wants you to go off with it , as if it wants to tell you something alone .
You agree now that we're not imagining this , don't you ?
No one admires speed more than the lazy .
No , really , I'm not .
I won't deny you anything !
When she is like this , besides walking and performing various activities , have you heard her say anything ?
I have to eat my dinner now .
Can any of your neighbors tell , Kate ?
I hope I never achieve success if I don't feel some of your heartbroken grief right now .
The fool will stay .
Oh , don't worry about it , we'll dip your I'll get you for that one .
I'm very glad about that .
Take a trumpet , herald .
Amen to that .
First let me talk with this philosopher here. ,
This week he was sad , moody , and depressed and very different from his usual self .
He's running bareheaded , calling for the end of the world , out there on a night like this , when even savage animals ravenous with hunger crawl under cover and hide .
And so , ?
What a spoiled little brat .
We heard it very clearly .
But she loves it so much ( since Othello told her she should always keep it with her ) that she always keeps it near her to kiss it and talk to it .
Yes it is , you half-blood .
I changed my mind .
At that time you can smash in his skull after seizing his books ; or you can bash his skull with a log ; or you can stab him in the belly ; or cut his windpipe .
I've been informed by certain sources I can't disclose that your younger brother Orlando plans to fight me in disguise .
Yes , it's well built , and the ship's pilot is very expert and experienced .
Why , what's the danger ?
She's the devil .
Call him !
Someone whose mood is as foul as the weather , very troubled .
How dare you tell us about God's laws when you have broken them so savagely yourself ?
Oh , how awful !
But Roderigo , if you're as courageous and determined as I think you are , then wait just a bit longer .
Hear the shrill whistle that brings order to the hubbub .
Stay invisible .
But I never spoke the whole time ?
Because if that's the case , I will tell you a plan that will get rid of your enemy and bring you closer to me .
Kings have trembled to kiss this hand .
I must leave them and seek some better employment .
I'm sure he's somewhere on the island .
But it wasn't until this afternoon that he broke out into violence .
Return to the gracious duke , good Catesby .
Are they all ready ?
So , sir .
Goodbye !
He swears he used to be a courtier .
What do you mean , beside yourself ?
I'll be more jealous of you than a wild rooster over his hen ; more noisy than a parrot chattering about the rain ; more fond of new things than an ape ; more giddy about getting what I want than a monkey .
That's true , it's your beauty's fault .
Prove you are worthy of your birth , which I do not doubt for a moment .
That will kill our lovers .
They are harder than the stones the house is made of .
We'll go together , and before we've spent all the savings of your youth , we'll find a way to make a living .
Forgive me , your grace .
Come , Dromio , let's go .
Whom did he leave in charge here ?
Here are my keys. , But why should I go ?
And the ghost frowned just like the king did once when he attacked the Poles , traveling on the ice in sleds .
Then Dobbin's tail must be growing backward .
Do what he says , William .
What a fearful night this is !
But don't delay .
Oh , this day has turned into a disaster !
Where should we go ?
You see , we're not alone in our unhappiness .
My lord , I don't know what's going on , but it seems to me that your highness isn't being treated as politely as before .
As I was standing watch on the hill , I looked toward Birnam , and I thought I saw the forest begin to move .
There's going to be a storm .
Hey !
Why , the he that will marry this woman .
I can not live without her .
Be kind now and tell me some excellent fortune .
His faults were equally matched by his virtues .
What did you do that for ?
Call them .
If you ever loved your poor dear father , Oh God !
Come on .
I swear to God I'll get revenge .
Paying debts is for peasants .
Please go .
Yes , he does .
I've said too much in telling you of it .
I think I hear Antony call me .
If you pay too much attention to him you'll make him angry , and that will make his convulsions go on longer .
Then give it a nice welcome , as you would give to any stranger .
I'm going to find out what you're thinking .
That's comforting .
I'm a fool. , Let's go , Lorenzo. , Goodbye for now .
Sir , I know I'm not a flatterer .
You should know , my loving lord , I've heard that the marquess Dorset has fled to Brittany , to the earl of Richmond .
And I'll tell him about the letter too .
No , you entertain your suitors with mild and gentle conversation , quiet and pleasant .
Did he lose his other eye ?
Don't say no .
If only I could spit poison .
I'll walk up and down and sing a song , so they'll know I'm not afraid .
Which he'll shove down our throats the way pigeons feed their young .
In that case it's good to be a post .
Today , great duke , she locked me out of my house and feasted there with whores .
Tell me , Othello .
And what if they won't go ?
Your grief should not be equal to his worth , because then your sorrow would never end .
Oh I hope that's not true !
It's shameful , and we have to make some changes right away .
Let's go greet him when he lands .
It isn't daybreak yet .
Goodbye .
His attendants are desperate , violent men .
We can't think that way about what we did .
An Englishman ?
I think I see a friend who will pay my bail and save my life .
A man is master of his own freedom : time is his only master , and when the right moment comes along , he'll come or go as he pleases .
She's gone forever .
So how can anyone say I'm alone , when the whole world is here to look at me ?
I will perform this ceremony every year .
Goneril with a white beard ?
And you yourself will determine the sentence as you see fit , and impose the death penalty if you choose to , even if the criminal were my own son .
Go take them back and smear the sleeping guards with the blood .
If you put me in the stocks you'll insult him both as a king and as a man .
Well , sir , the gown is not for me .
To Adriana ?
Besides , how have I offended you , my friends ?
Then everything must really be finished .
Woman , stop your frantic curses and false prophesies before we run out of patience and do something bad to you .
He's too good to have any compassion for you .
Don't let the heavens hear these chattery women abuse the Lord's anointed king .
We did , my lord , weeping and carrying on about the sobbing deer .
The interest rate will be , Well , Shylock ?
The noble Brutus told you that Caesar was ambitious .
Let me lick your shoe .
Your darling ?
They're playing with me .
You'll be afraid to hear it .
Good food's not a big deal , everyone can afford that .
We don't want you to think we came here to offend you , except that we want to offend you with our good intentions .
I'll come see you right away .
Listen to Antony .
By the Lord who raised me to this weighty post from the happy and carefree life I used to enjoy , I promise you I never did anything to get the king to turn against the duke of Clarence .
Good luck , sir .
About the table , sir , dinner will be served on it .
If you've got any music that can't be heard , then play that .
Weren't you ordered , on penalty of , Why Dover ? , Let him answer that question first .
I'll leave you without revealing any emotion , like a man of steel .
I hope you're right .
What do you want from me , my good man ?
I want my bond , so stop talking .
Come on , show me the wound that my eyes have caused .
Are you ?
As I was working on one musty room , the Prince and Claudio entered .
Isn't that the reason you told me all this ?
This is Casca .
What , are you sleepy ?
Nothing , my lord .
Right or not , it's made you the Earl of Gloucester .
Let the dying fire shine a glimmering light throughout the house .
Good heavens , man , give them more than that !
Come here , Leonato .
Fulvia is dead .
It's your music , madam , from your house .
Damn it !
Bless your heart .
The Moor says the man you hurt is very important in Cyprus , and that under the circumstances he has no choice but to refuse to reinstate you .
Sir , it's a troupe of actors who want to perform for your Lordship .
I found him here , Beating ?
And now I'll do it .
Not at all , Touchstone .
Whore , your lover's dead now , and you'll be going to hell soon .
What do you mean , "in a strange way" ?
Well , at least that's something .
And why do you blame me for loving you ?
That's it , I'm done .
I have to tell you , I thought you were a much kinder person than this .
Most noble Antony ! " Then , as she was speaking your name , a strangled groan split her words .
As it is God's will and pleasure , Captain , I entreat you to come quickly to the king .
I wish you'd won the Something bad in that letter is making Bassanio turn pale .
Such an expression of despair would only prove that I was guilty .
Then you're a better man than the king .
But you've seen her and Cassio together .
Lysander and I are running away from here .
Yes , my lord .
I'll join you , sir .
Madam , I'd better leave now .
And she's fierce , even though she's little .
Didn't you go to her for a purse full of ducats ?
They killed my children too ?
By his side lies the noble earl of Suffolk , York's comrade and equal in brave wounds .
I didn't take any more pains bringing this message than you took pains in thanking me." That's like saying , "Any thing I do for you is as easy as saying 'thank you.'" If this doesn't move me to take pity on her , I'm a horrible person .
Is your name William ?
They're very anxious for you to get there .
Go and put on your own armor .
Exactly , madam , until I sleep with you .
Yes , my lady .
Here's my hand .
Or if you follow me , you'd better understand that I'll do something bad to you in the forest .
This storm protects me from thoughts that would hurt me more .
This is his sword .
Take this !
Come , my sweet Kate .
Again , good night , kind lords and gentlemen .
Oh , he was gentle , mild , and virtuous .
Oh you damned villain !
To work for you , sir .
But you would be more honorable if you changed your mind .
Where is he ?
Quiet !
Not me .
Many former friends of ours have gathered to meet the fleet and aren't willing to beat it back .
If you're happy with what you've won And accept this prize as your blissful destiny , Then turn to where your lady is , And claim her with a loving kiss."
Hortensio , have you come to break up the fight ?
You must understand , Silius , that it's better to leave something undone than achieve too much fame in your superior's absence .
It's no time for jokes : sober up .
I can not speak your England .
You'll grant me , you hedgehog ?
A lovely , cunning shore can distract a man from the perils of a stormy sea , just as a pretty scarf can hide a dangerous dark-skinned beauty .
Goblin , lead them up and down .
Jesus , he's an ass if there ever was one !
Good-bye , sir .
Fair princess , you've missed some good sport .
Let's go .
She takes these signs for warnings and predictions of terrible evils to come , and , on her knee , she begged me to stay home today .
Bring here The gentleman who advised you To give away your land .
Stay with us tonight .
What makes you say that ?
What should we do with all these rhyming fools that follow us from post to post ?
It seems that the guards who were supposed to be protecting his chamber did it .
I'll do anything rather than marry a drunk , Nerissa .
I'm telling you , just watch his face .
The man in the moon !
If you don't like him you should quit .
No .
If I were king ?
You , will you join with me ?
For my part , I really don't care .
Listen , hussy , is this man one of your customers ?
No , I had to do something .
Let your thoughts make up for our imperfections .
He did ask for mercy .
That our clothes were drenched with sea water , but they came out looking brand-new .
Be silent and go in .
Your grave is gaping open , and your death is near .
We won't hold back any of our wisdom .
Come on , bring them in .
I will , even if I were king of all kingdoms .
If I ever see it , I will challenge you .
How are you ?
The truth will be all the inheritance you get .
This is your job .
Word is that Richmond is the navy's admiral .
It's always better to get rid of what you're scared of than to be afraid .
Is it true , is it true ?
Prepare your troops .
Are you over your ridiculous mood ?
And you'll speak on the same platform as I do , after I'm done .
Be happy about it .
Look at you !
I wouldn't do that for the whole wide world .
I won't deny him anything of mine , including my own body and my husband's bed .
About an hour for the ringing and fifteen minutes for the crying .
You told me to make it well and properly and in keeping with the current style .
Please just listen .
No , son .
I never saw Cassio's kisses on her lips .
If I could get my hands on you , I'd make you care .
It doesn't look that way to me .
I'll say goodbye once more .
And I think she's at least thirty .
I don't know any fancy ways of talking about love , only to say right out , "I love you." If you press me any further than with the question , "Do you really ? " my love scene is over .
I will .
But if you steal my reputation , you're robbing me of something that doesn't make you richer , but makes me much poorer .
Just a minute ago I was the owner of this beautiful mansion , master of these servants , and queen over myself .
So , good-bye .
Go bring them all here ; I give you power over them .
When was there ever before so great a loss on one side and so little on the other , in the ordinary and equal clash of battle ?
Denmark's a prison .
Listen to me , for I have something to tell you .
Where's Seleucus ?
We'll write it in alternating eight- and six-syllable lines , just like in a ballad .
One of us will stay and stand guard .
But no matter , I'll get back at him soon enough .
No more talk about my father ; you'll be whipped for slander one of these days .
That her father's brother wants to be her husband ?
I'm serious , I can't .
What a farce !
I think there must be something invigorating about death , since she dies with such enthusiasm .
The English are in the field , French lords .
Nice Grumio , bring me some .
Let's hope his sense of shame will send him back to Rome quickly .
Stay warm .
Your death would prevent that .
When this wood burns , it'll weep for making you tired .
I've locked it up in my room .
Nonsense !
Time's not the one in debt .
No , my lord .
Go ahead .
Great kings of France and England , I owe you both equal service and loyalty .
Promising favors ?
Oh-ho-ho , kid !
I'll take responsibility for that .
I curse myself for doing that !
Don't take my love for granted .
piece of cheese will get him. , I challenge you to a match .
Luck and Antony separate here and now .
It looks like these witches are scared of swords .
Why not stay and hear me talk to him ?
But mortals like you aren't allowed to hear this description of the afterlife .
I've been stripped of everything , betrayed .
Wasn't that letter from Jessica ?
Monster sweetie , be a good monster and just speak once .
Well , what do you guess ?
Poor Tom , your cup is empty .
That's an odd thing to say .
What we do we have been commanded to do .
When his god falls asleep , the monster will snatch his wine bottle .
Yes , sir , I have .
Though I have far more reason , I don't have as much energy to curse you .
Caesar .
Oh , I wish you'd never been born !
What other rites are you going to give her ?
This is the devil Flibbertigibbet .
Observe how Antony takes his defeat and how his attitude influences his actions .
Yes , very bad .
Now , Catesby , what does your lord say to my request ?
So that England may live a long life like this , let God say amen !
Turn the ship to the wind !
have lost , and the indignity we have endured , for which he is too insignificant to sufficiently pay us back .
I sent the king's son off by himself to a faraway nook on the island , where he's sitting now sighing , with his arms crossed like this .
Let's stay and watch a while .
Isn't there any other rite you can perform ?
No , my lord , that was me .
Oh , father , I'm taking care of your business .
It doesn't make either of us happy , I know .
Turn right at the next turn , but at the following turn , turn left .
And as king I'll love you forever .
Won't the ladies be scared of the lion ?
And now you're asking for money .
A nice stool .
Motley is the only thing to wear .
So beware of my contempt , and keep your promise .
It's not for me to say .
Tell them you know that Hero loves me .
And like I am for Ganymede .
He's like a cowardly
That was a fine fanfare , boys .
And I swear by my wickedness ( if I had any ) that I am a knave .
It was incredible !
I told him to knock at your gate and for the life of me could not get him to do it .
Let them last forever .
With my eye sockets ?
What's your name ?
Honest Iago's arranged that .
He's giving her a taste of her own medicine .
No , it's just after twelve ; I heard the clock strike .
Give me your arm .
Excuse me , sir ?
It doesn't get seen enough ; you should wear it in your cap , the way fools wear coxcombs .
This messenger is wise .
It's too bad .
Pardon me , but I'm just repeating what you yourself have said .
Each of you , give me your bloody hand .
Besides that , he says that two meetings are going to be held tomorrow , and something may be decided at one of them that may make you and him , who are at the other , sorry .
I would choose to take my penalty .
It's all still yours .
him terribly .
It would make him curse the heavens and be damned to hell .
Do whatever you want , and I'll say your insults are just a bad mood .
Or did you agree to this as equals ?
He has a ring of mine , worth forty ducats , and he promised to give me a necklace in exchange for it .
Seriously , I think our clothes are as fresh now as they were the day we put them on in Africa , when we attended the marriage of the king's daughter Claribel to the King of Tunis .
Is he married to Cleopatra ?
Captain Fluellen !
I figure that once he's crippled me , I'll beg by showing off my beatings .
If things are the way people tell me they are , and they're only telling me this to warn me , then I have to say , you're not conducting yourself with the self-restraint a daughter of mine should show .
If it isn't my old friend Grumio , and my dear friend Petruchio !
This is how the candle burned the moth .
I do , in fact .
Yes , and she was mild too .
Words before fighting .
An era of universal peace is about to start .
Did you plan Cassio's death with him ?
And , as the speaker of any prologue should , I ask you to hear our play courteously and to judge it kindly .
You can go straight to hell !
Let him mount the pulpit .
My lord Sebastian , even though what you say is true , your way of saying it is tactless and comes at the wrong time .
Get up and tell me how you came here .
And what would you give me for the handkerchief ?
With any luck , the sea and new countries will push out these thoughts that have somehow taken root in his mind .
If she wants to be proud , or "honest , " as she calls it , she can just marry her own pride .
Oh !
You've got a sword , Gloucester .
Are you really alive , Stephano ?
What are you talking about ?
Yes .
But no beautiful woman has an honest face .
I think if we had fought , we would have proven too young and strong for them after all .
Examine them yourselves , then bring me your findings .
I hope this explanation will stand as my excuse .
Don't tone things down or exaggerate them out of hostility .
Bassanio , the best thing you can do is to keep living and write an epitaph for my gravestone .
Caesar has sent , Too slow a messenger .
That's what her mother always tells me .
And now he's gone .
You're most welcome .
I don't see any blood .
You !
Which one will start yammering first , Gonzalo or Adrian ?
Calm down , Smulkin , you fiend !
Why , you speak like an experienced and quiet watchman .
All right , go ahead , keep up your little game , pretend to be sympathetic , but then nudge each other and wink and make faces at me when I turn my back .
I couldn't bear to obey all of your daughters ' harsh orders .
Give my answer to them both .
Dromio , bring this money to the Centaur Inn , where we're lodging , and wait there until I come .
Don't be disturbed by my illness .
There's other work for you to do .
You're snoring , but it sounds like you're talking .
Let me see his face .
I mistook you for that sly Venetian woman who married Othello. , You whorehouse-keeper .
I was ordered not to .
And wouldn't I be damned if I let this monster live to do more harm ?
Give him this money and these letters , Reynaldo .
Sir , we'll follow as soon as Mark Antony kisses Octavia good-bye .
Transform your grief into anger .
Hero is his only child , and his only heir .
He told us to arrange it .
If our father continues to use his authority as usual , then his recent abdication of the kingdom will just hurt us .
In prison we'll outlast hordes of rulers that will come and go as their fortunes change .
I know the man well .
You were right the first time .
I don't have the proud melancholy of a courtier or the ambitious melancholy of a soldier or the calculated melancholy of a lawyer .
Listen to my little story , and when it's done , oh , my heart will break !
I know my rights .
It's a capital offense for anyone from Mantua to come to Padua .
Let's go , because it's already after midnight , and we want him on our side before daylight .
My husband !
If she punishes you , master , she's sure to punish me .
for the other men , we can make them believe anything we choose .
Everything will be all right .
With that , I'll be off .
Therefore , my old age is like a blustery winter : cold , but kindly .
No , come on , one more time .
One of these three boxes contains her lovely picture .
As for Michael Cassio , I think it would be safe for me to swear that he's honest .
I'll show you how .
Oh , be quiet .
If we do , it'll drive us crazy .
That will be a good thing .
See that it is done , and prepare a feast for the soldiers .
He discovered that the man was his older brother .
The lieutenant has to get to heaven before the ensign .
He won't have a chance .
I'd give up my life and take my son's place in the mud on the ocean floor if I could see them alive in Naples. , When did you lose your daughter ?
Oh , are you here , Iago ?
Therefore , I beg your Highness , pardon me .
Good morning , brother Bedford .
Tell me your idea first .
I saw him holding the handkerchief !
His virtue is not hidden .
When you've finished all this , return to the porch of Pompey's theater , where you'll find us .
Give him the instructions for our amusing little contract , and I'll go get the money for you right away .
I became his guide , I led him and begged for him , and kept him from suicide .
If only all struggles ended this well .
No ?
Age is the thing that nourishes .
I admit that in front of you , my lady , she keeps a bit quiet .
Now I've paid you back , Parthia , and gotten revenge for Marcus Crassus' death .
Well , she got away .
Go home , you lazy men .
I've destroyed my reputation , a most shameful error .
We're sitting ducks for the French , if they only knew it , for there is no one guarding it but boys .
If true lovers are always thwarted , then it must be a rule of fate .
Is this your idea of success ?
Wait , good Beatrice .
Sir , sir !
If not , he's got truth on his side !
Caesar is upset .
Ha !
If I told them about this back in Naples , would they believe me ?
I'm not afraid of dead uncles .
Come with us , Lepidus .
Will you fight well ?
Moonshine and Lion are left to bury the dead .
Knowing how much I loved my books , he gave me some books from my library that I value more than my dukedom .
By the end I will either live , or else I'll restore my honor by shedding my blood .
Do you hear what I'm saying , Iago ?
He never did anything in his whole life that looked as good as the way he died .
I'm glad to see you go .
Lunatics , lovers , and poets all are ruled by their overactive imaginations .
If he hadn't , we'd all be embarrassed to look at him .
I'll tell her .
Why have you gotten so rude ?
I sincerely hope it does you good , mangy rascal .
We were pushed out of power by evil deeds , as you call them .
Everything would be produced without labor , and would be shared by all .
Let me go , gentlemen .
Well , I think it's good to be serious and keep quiet .
Then run away .
But goodbye .
What did you say ?
I've changed my mind about that .
Though the truth of your treachery is as plain as black on white , I can scarcely believe it , it's so past understanding .
What you were afraid of has happened .
Look , it's the Prince and Mr. Love .
A constant pain to me !
I can hear the lark singing .
And when has he ever been known to wash his face ?
I swear to you , many members of your mustard family have made my eyes water before .
What do you think you're doing ?
Maybe we can benefit from the same chaos that has defeated us .
Bassanio told him he'd try to hurry back .
Oh , traitors , villains !
Then the two of them will both pursue one girl .
Here's what you'll do .
Oh , Isis , that's impossible .
Yes , monstrous , monstrous !
We've been looking for him everywhere .
We're not saying anything treasonous , man .
Drunk ?
Come on , sir .
Goodbye , good Mr. Love .
But sir , he's crazy .
Claudio , take my daughter , and , with her , take my fortunes .
I've served you since childhood , but I've never done you a better service than telling you to stop .
Sir , enter the castle .
I hear someone knocking at the south entry .
Come , gentlemen , let's discuss tomorrow's action in my tent .
Is everyone here ?
Take comfort .
Yes , it's Emilia .
Pile of dirt !
You can have it then , your highness .
Until you get back , Nerissa and I will live like virgins and widows .
You need to leave to take care of your own business .
Here , my good lord .
Lights , lights , get us some lights !
Neither rhyme nor reason can express how much I love her .
Are these the wretches that we threw dice for ?
My soul is stuck to sin , and the more it struggles to break free , the more it sticks .
Well , I'm sorry for you , gentle Silvius .
Everyone join hands .
Take my hand , Hastings .
Why do you need twenty-five knights , or ten , or even five , when you're staying in a house with a staff of double that at your service ?
Look , his noble blood is still on it .
It's doubly wrong to cheat on your wife and then let her see the offense in your eyes .
Maybe , but you're wrinkled all the same .
If she is , you can sue me for lying to you .
Try being sick , great greatness , and see if ceremony can cure you !
No , add a couple more syllables .
Oh , oh , oh , oh .
Yes , for three months .
Follow me , madam. , Throw the blind traitor outside .
Actually I think I would , and then I'd undo it after I did it .
Just say it .
My lord , he wonders why you have assembled such troops of citizens to speak with him , since he had no idea they were coming .
I hope you remember that I said all this because I love you .
Your bedroom .
If you poison us , don't we die ?
Welcome back !
I've never heard such confused emotions as what that Jew dog was shouting in the streets .
Two of my brother's men , all tied up !
Get information from her .
Without doubt I've heard that .
Unless you can also teach me how to forget my banished father , you shouldn't try to teach me how to be happy .
Yes , but how he adores Mark Antony !
Her eyes are like April : full of showers .
Get out of my face .
But did I fall or not ?
What could I say , my dear ?
My old brain is troubled .
I could have saved her .
Once we have covered the two servants with blood , and used their daggers to kill , won't people believe that they were the culprits ?
It's worse than murder to humiliate a king's messenger like this .
I won't be kind to you .
You know what you know .
I swam ashore like a duck .
I'll get your goats , Audrey .
Oh , mischief has ruined our plans !
Give it to my wife , and get your money .
Why are you talking to me like this ?
Now that he's old , we can expect to have to deal not only with his old character flaws , which have turned into deep-rooted habits , but also with the uncontrollable crabbiness that comes with old age .
And we will raise your wages .
I won't consider it .
All because of what happened to that brat Rutland ?
Will we be separated ?
End it , then , and everything is over. , Eros ! , I'm coming , my Queen ! , Eros ! , Wait for me .
Richard , the duke of Gloucester , is very dangerous , and the queen's sons and brothers are haughty and proud , it would be better for this ailing country if they were subjects , not rulers .
Why bother with them ?
No , I swear , I don't even know what's in it .
I can help you find a wife who's rich , young , beautiful , and reared in a manner fit for a gentlewoman .
You're still here ?
I'll meet all your attacks , even if you come charging at me with a lance at full gallop .
And just try to remember a few rules of life .
You have impatience all over your face .
He is close to death , but not dead yet .
Alas , why would you heap all these responsibilities on me ?
I've been alive for twenty-eight years , and I've never met a man who knew what was good for him .
I don't know her , but I know her father and he knew mine well .
Tell him to surrender .
I will go out .
It eases the spirit .
From this moment on , I'll never say another word .
All these quarrels are about me .
These lords seem so astonished that they've lost their use of reason and can hardly believe what they see with their own eyes. , But whatever the reason for your losing your senses , you can know for sure that I'm Prospero , that same duke who was kicked out of Milan and landed on this same island where you landed , and became the lord of it .
Fair and noble hostess , we are your guests tonight .
No , after you .
You lie , you disgusting tyrant .
And go away , witch , go away .
Do you know him ?
Why ?
A big blast of wind shook our fortifications .
Where's the jury , the judge , the lawful proceedings , the verdict ?
It's mine , sir .
Yes , yes , my lord .
I remember he's already occupied .
I don't have any news to report , my lord .
I need a doctor .
He is like a god and knows the truth .
That's more than we know .
He likes me , and I've given him good reason to .
He has to pay the price for his foolish actions .
Is that true ?
I followed it here , or I should say it dragged me here .
Your scolding is somewhat overblown .
The whole world thought your father was an honorable man , but he was always my enemy .
I have more news too .
Christ , it's a disaster .
Shall I come down ?
Yes , look , it's true that children are punished for the sins of their fathers .
We , now at our largest , can only decrease .
Good luck , worthy soldier , and good-bye .
It won't be long before I'm back .
You suffered a loss like mine ?
Hortensio and I have given you up .
Now he lies there worth nothing , and no one is so humble as to show him respect .
Is he still alive , good uncle ?
I didn't say anything .
Kiss her soft mouth , and we'll be off .
Good morning , my friends .
If you still feel so affectionate toward her , then why not give her permission to cheat on you ?
I can't stand her .
That's just how he is .
Nothing but "little" and "short" ! , Why are you letting her insult me like this ?
Very wise .
What's your name ?
Let me see it .
Will I hear from you soon ?
As it dissolves , so shall my life .
As wicked as I am , they were slaughtered because of me , not because of anything they did .
Your complaint against me is perfectly understandable , but I still insist I've done everything I could to help you .
Will you say grace , sweet Kate , or shall I ? , What is this ?
It's on such a high tide that we're now floating , and we must take the current when it is offered , or lose our campaign .
Well , then , be brave and pretend to be a man .
Strangle her in her bed , the same bed she's contaminated .
Caesar ?
We've seen the best our age has to offer .
Do so .
You see , her eyes are open .
My sons Edward and Clarence !
You're not answering my question .
I swear I thought you meant you'd been hurt physically .
And when a wise man gives you better advice than I just did , give me my advice back again .
And he told us to follow him to the temple .
Look who's coming .
Why , he won't wake up till Judgment Day .
I have to go .
Then sure ones .
It's good to grow .
Who could be out of things to say if he were with the girl he loves ?
What does he say ?
Help me here .
I'll tell you what to do .
No , don't even mention him .
Who put out the light ?
Yes , sir .
My vision is dull .
What support did I have other than Edward ?
Howl , howl , howl , howl !
I gave my lover a ring and made him swear never to lose it or give it away .
Then hear me , gracious sovereign , and all you peers who owe your lives and duty to this imperial throne .
Even the fragile wren , the smallest of birds , will fight against the owl when it threatens her young ones in the nest .
The moon's bright tonight .
Demetrius is an admirable man .
No !
Lord , how painful it was to drown .
When Roscius was an actor in ancient Rome , The actors have arrived , my lord .
Farewell , good Strato .
My lord , he's afraid you mean him harm .
My dear Portia , if you knew who I gave the ring to , for whose sake I gave the ring to him , why I gave it to him , and how unwilling I was to leave it when he wouldn't accept anything but the ring , you wouldn't be so angry .
Why are you talking about robbery ?
Live in the moment .
The fact that this summer bird , the house martin , builds his nests here proves how inviting the breezes are .
Oh , I don't know .
Let them marry your children !
I'm afraid that I wrong the honorable men whose daggers have stabbed Caesar .
With his own lightning bolts ; I've shaken up the sturdy cliffs and uprooted pines and cedars ; I've opened up graves and awakened the corpses sleeping in them , letting them out with my powerful magic .
Is he married ?
I tell you truly , in true English : I love you , Kate .
You seasoned his food with screams .
Read it , great Caesar .
Didn't I turn down the page where I left off reading ?
Go bring them here .
How will you get proof ?
My uncle the king is to blame for this .
I wish you well .
Then I have to assume you don't want him to be king .
Ask this man's forgiveness , love him , and accept his offer .
I'm just sorry I had to be the one to kill him .
Oh , what a fall it was , my countrymen !
How are things going now ?
On a night like this a campfire in an empty field would be like the heart of a dirty old man , a tiny spark in a cold body .
What a pain .
That's how Claudio will respond .
If your master wants a queen to beg from him , you should tell him that a queen will beg for no less than a kingdom .
All this fighting is because of you .
I say my prayers out loud .
By my faith in love , I will , then .
Then I'll change it to this : Father Time himself is bald , so for all time there will be bald men .
I've seen both of you fence .
Each day new widows howl , new orphans cry , and new sorrows slap heaven in the face , until it sounds like heaven itself feels Scotland's anguish and screams in pain .
Bottom , you're Pyramus. , And Flute , you're Thisbe .
Farewell .
Farewell , hostess .
Enough of this frivolous talk .
Silver .
My sweet darling cries when she sees me work and tells me that such a wonderful man never performed such lowly tasks before .
But I'm sorry , I'm not allowed to let you visit them .
A lot of words .
Put the goblets of wine on that table .
What sickness did she die of ?
They finished their business with Pompey , and Pompey has left .
And if I , your poor devoted servant , may ask you for one small favor , you will guarantee my happiness forever .
And even though Nature has given us the wit to have this argument , hasn't Fortune sent this fool here to stop us ?
All I wanted to tell you is that the lantern is the moon , I'm the man in the moon , this thornbush is my thornbush , and this dog is my dog .
You're using this as an excuse for not showing up at the Porcupine like you promised .
Everyone else , march on with me .
Go back to where you're staying and go to sleep .
I know he wouldn't be a wolf if the Romans didn't act like sheep .
Congratulations , lady : you resemble a most honorable man .
Come forward and speak .
I'm not going to be bothered by you for long .
This is some monster of the island , with four legs , who seems to me to have some kind of ache .
Really , Audrey , I wish you were more poetical .
Come like shadows and depart in the same way !
Good , sir ?
But you still wish the gods had made me poetical ?
Give me one , " I said .
That's enough .
Hurry , hurry , prepare my horse .
What is your name ?
It is .
That's another bad deal I've made ! , a bankrupt , a spendthrift , who now has to hide his head on the Rialto , a beggar who used to look so smug in front of the other merchants .
Antony's eyes are fiery red from crying .
I'm sure Lorenzo isn't on their ship .
Therefore I say again that he must have used some powerful drug or magic potion on her .
My strength is all gone , as if in a dream .
There are enemies here .
If your affection for me doesn't convince you to come , don't let my letter do so." Oh , my darling , make your arrangements and go !
Oh , sweet mermaid , don't command me to drown myself in the flood of your sister's tears .
Where is Montjoy , the herald ?
It doesn't matter .
Quiet , you stupid fool .
Well , I don't .
Now please , tell Beatrice to come out .
Can't a plain man live and do no harm to anyone without being taken advantage of by a bunch of slick , sneaky lowlifes ?
Please .
Gentlemen , on to the bridal dinner .
You can't trust them .
What did you say , uncle ?
Why , you're absolutely right , cousin .
They shout for joy .
Hello there , good sirs .
Past noon .
Farewell , farewell .
I'll bet we're both thinking the same thing , master .
You look angry .
What marvelous music !
I wish they'd fight in fire or in the air .
Or are you low , vulgar , and of the common people ?
Shame of what , lady ?
What was that thing I saw moving away from you up on the cliff before you fell ?
Now , if that's true , and it's obviously true , who's in a better position than Cassio ?
But it is his handwriting ?
If you close the doors on a woman's wit , it'll fly out the window .
Yes , ma'am .
Don't spend any more time here .
We'll send Mark Antony to the senate house , and he'll say that you're sick today .
You know that I used to believe in Epicurus and his disregard for omens .
He said he would deny that he wrote his letter ?
Any man can get drunk sometime .
Take my sword .
They're wise and honorable , and will no doubt give you reasons for it .
Give me another horse !
Bring that swinger Orlando here .
I'm going to get my Please , listen to me .
If I owe you anything , I'll pay you in clubbings .
When powerful kings cave in to flatterers , do you think loyal men will be afraid to speak out against it ?
The English have promised me thousands of troops .
Why do you look so depressed today , your Grace ?
Hold on a second .
No , it doesn't mean anything .
Good-bye .
Oh , how fortunate that horse is to have Antony on him .
And don't be proud .
You saw my master wink and laugh at you ?
It's a lot to ask of a maiden .
I'm going to make sure I stay on your good side , lady .
I can't even be sure these are my hands .
Do I ask you to follow me ?
I swear the only ransom will be these bones of mine .
Find a time to speak with Don Pedro and Claudio alone .
Wait , countrymen .
I would gladly do without that if he would only stay faithful to me .
How are you , my pretty Bianca ?
With the help of the grim The first to greet me there was my great
Come , why be so hesitant ?
I've worked it out .
So she is drowned .
Remember what I've told you .
Come on , get ready .
Oh , God help me !
What , you're not a whore ?
This hard work would be boring and nasty to me , but I'm working for a mistress who makes me enjoy my labor .
Or , rather , I'll kill you , or I'll do away with you , or I'll turn your life into death and your freedom into captivity .
You always loved to tell me I couldn't do anything without being told .
An evil soul using a holy story is like a criminal who smiles at you .
But if we have reasons that are strong enough to ignite cowards into action and to make weak women brave , and I think we do , then , countrymen , what else could we possibly need to spur us to action ?
What are you doing ?
Come help me bless this couple , so they will be prosperous and have many children .
Yet not one among them , if all three were to wait on me , could be my "man , " because three such fakes don't amount to a man .
Your husband , being saddled with a shrew , projects his own suffering onto my husband .
Come on , Casca , you and I will go see Brutus at his house before sunrise .
The moral of this story is that it's not enough to speak ; you have to speak grammatically .
What's your answer ?
You thought because he didn't speak English like a native he couldn't handle an English club .
He can't possibly be such a monster , And I'm sure he isn't .
You're shaking with emotion .
His wildness is a threat to all of us , to you , to me , to everyone .
I'm an ass , I'm a woman's servant , and I'm beside myself .
Let me shake your hand .
I'd trust him with everything I own .
Keep your voice down .
Go on , my loving lord .
Now Antony has to leave her completely .
Is the news good or bad that you enter without knocking ?
Bring the fancy clothes out of my house , to use as bait to catch these thieves .
Did you notice ?
Master , knock hard upon the door .
I can't run away .
This is Caesar you're looking at .
Ruining his meals , his enjoyment , and his sleep would drive any man or beast mad .
Listen !
Bring his will here , and we'll figure out a way to reduce his bequests to the people .
There's still a bit of daylight in the sky .
What is that bloody knife ?
While you were dazed by grief , which isn't appropriate for a man like you , Cassio showed up here .
Oh , let me remember what happened to Hastings and hurry to
We'll all want our fortune told .
And good ones , too .
If I live to see it , I'll never trust his word again .
Good morning , sir .
Is there anyone to give the bride away ?
Her once-trimmed hedges , like prisoners with wild , untended hair , put forth unruly twigs .
I'll do as you say , father .
Two of both kinds makes four .
Oh , please don't swear , my lord of Buckingham .
Just listen this once .
Shylock , they're offering you three times the money you lent .
Give it up and go drink .
My royal kinsman , are you teaching our princess English ?
Tell him to bring his pen and his inkwell to the jail .
My stomach's a little upset .
Has he asked for me ?
Nice save !
That's all I want , and I'll do anything to accomplish it .
I'm dying to hear your life story , which must be a strange tale .
Go disguise yourself as a sea nymph .
Tell the hot-headed duke that I, But no , not yet .
God knows why , but your mother and your brother have taken sanctuary in Westminster Abbey .
Or did the letter make him emotional somehow , and this is the first time he's done it ?
You will be exhibited in Rome along with me , like Egyptian puppets .
What a crazy island this is .
It goes along with being born to greatness , but it makes you get badmouthed by every fool who only has his own suffering to care about .
Her eyes are vicious , but yours are comforting .
God alive !
Other than Richard , even those whom we fight against would rather we won .
There he is at the window .
Either we go after Pompey or he'll come after us .
My master will be here in the morning .
By the way , if I were to compose an extra speech of twelve to sixteen lines and stick it into the play , you could learn it by heart for tomorrow , right ?
As I get to leech him , I will show some mercy .
To have seen much but own nothing is to have rich eyes and poor hands .
The best thing about me is that I'm hardworking .
You're acting like an ass , don't you think ?
Which ring did you give away , my lord ?
For I'm sure that although you may know what temperance is , you've never experienced it firsthand .
Sweet men , come to him .
It was a color he never did like .
This much I can say about him : he is well-born , has proven his bravery in battle , and has established his good character .
Well , it's a fault I wouldn't trade for your best virtue .
Look , here he comes .
Prepare yourselves , generals .
Get out of my sight !
Read it instantly .
The will , the will !
Captain Macmorris , when we have more leisure , see , I will be so bold as to show you I know about the practice of warfare , and that's that .
Where's the Queen ?
Father , this isn't easy for me .
Oh , the things men dare to do !
Though science can explain them away , disasters still come after eclipses .
Well done !
Last night , when that star to the west of the North Star had traveled across the night sky to that point where it's shining now , at one o'clock , Marcellus and I , Quiet , shut up !
That's right , and then after we fixed the moon , we'd go bird-hunting .
He has killed me , Mother .
She will not .
Oh , lying woman !
You force me to read the will , then ?
I won't say no to you , but let it be known that I'm only doing this after a lot of persuasion and to save your life , I hear you were quickly wasting away without me .
And there were a hundred spooked women huddled together in fear who swore they saw men on fire walk up and down the streets .
No , master , I've been changed in both mind and body .
If Fulvia were the last woman on earth , there would be a reason to grieve .
Let's go .
If we were in front of our armies , about to fight , I would do this .
They certainly do like to butt heads !
I never saw such a shameful act .
Healing is part and parcel of my religious vows ; it is a charitable duty my order performs .
Well , it doesn't matter anymore .
If it pleases your Majesty , let his neck pay the price , if there is any martial law in the world .
Let's hear it .
My dearest relative , I'm begging you , pull yourself together .
What's the matter ?
I give you a sister whom I love more than a brother ever loved any sister .
Men who risk everything hope to make profits .
What did he say when he regained consciousness ?
You knew that my sword , weakened by my love for you , would obey that love no matter what .
Tell me to run , and I'll run .
Yes , I am .
What do you mean , my lord ?
You'll be sorry later , but it'll be too late .
I'm afraid we're intruding too boldly on your sleep time .
How did they die ?
Leave him to my wrath. , Edmund , go with my sister-in-law .
He who will not follow me now , let him depart and stand in the doorway like a pimp , cap in hand , while some slave , no nobler than my dog , violates his daughter .
I mean well , sir .
Listen .
I also hope that we can be better strangers .
No more than I do yours .
Or at least I can describe the rumors .
Emilia , go to the castle and tell Othello and Desdemona what happened. , Will you please go now ?
No , by our Lady , I don't think he can .
I won't wrong any of my friends , because I don't have any to mourn for me , and I won't have wronged the world , because I don't have anything in the world .
I'll do whatever the king wants .
This little prank of hers is going to cost me .
Yes .
Noses , ears , lips .
Please , dear , calm down .
The storm separated us .
So the lion disappeared .
I wouldn't commit so serious a crime for anything .
How did you tolerate prison ?
I'm going to cry .
You'll be my witness that I've been forced , as Pompey was , to wager all of our freedoms on one battle .
Do you mean to say that the duke has abandoned the glamorous court to live as a monk ?
Here an angel's lying in a golden bed. , Give me the key .
They did , Fluellen .
Follow and see to it that nothing serious happens between them .
Or if you've got some buried treasure somewhere , which they say often makes ghosts restless , then tell us about it .
Do you know me ?
The point is that she didn't write this letter .
Farewell , lady .
Me , a penny ?
Well , I'm the man you're speaking of .
If it turns out he wasn't , certain people are going to get it .
So the weak third of the triumvirate is imprisoned until death frees him .
There's a man haunting this forest who abuses the trees by carving "Rosalind" on their barks .
I pray that God will let me learn from women like that , not to follow their bad example , but to avoid it !
Your brother is young and inexperienced , and because of my affection for you , I'd hate to crush him , though I'd have to , if he challenged me .
The poor souls , how strangely they talk !
Come on .
Please , dear , come here .
The problem is in what the letter says , as far as I can tell .
If you hang around me for two more years , you'll forget the sound of your own voice .
A tiny spot of evil casts doubt on their good qualities and ruins their reputations .
You're getting in the way of our work .
I want all such offenders to be dealt with that way , and I give precise orders that in our progress through the country there shall be nothing seized from the villages , nothing taken that is not paid for , none of the French harassed or abused in disrespectful language .
I thank you , Sir John , with all my heart .
Hello , mortal !
He uses his clownishness to disguise his deadly wit .
I've decided on a plan that doesn't require your assistance .
How is Hamlet ?
What news , man ?
The air is sweet and appeals to my refined senses .
Or come back to life again and challenge me to a duel in some deserted place .
Lysander , keep your Hermia .
Soak your hands in blood and gore , since you have cut the thread of his life with scissors .
I know you can do better than that , but it'll do for now .
I'll stop at every house .
The storm has begun and everything is at stake .
I beg your pardon .
She's the one who's got to do it .
So , tell people that you're from Epidamnum-otherwise all your goods will be confiscated .
We don't intend any harm to you , nor to anyone else .
I'll fight every one of these devils if I have to , one at a time .
You killed my child .
Who heard me do that ?
You're in your own kingdom , sir .
Was it a man ?
I swear , By nothing , because this is no oath .
My arm is sore .
He used to lend money as a favor between Christians ; but now , let him think about his own debt .
Here's someone coming in his pajamas , with a candle and weapons .
A wonderful miracle !
If your gentle souls are still flying in the air and have not yet landed where they will remain forever , hover around me with your airy wings and hear your mother's lament .
The crows flying down below look as small as ants .
The moon has set .
Othello , have one of your officers stay behind to bring you your commission and whatever else is important to you .
It may be that his antagonist is a gentleman of very high degree , quite outside of his own sphere .
And I'm such a sensitive ass that if my hair even tickles me a little , I need to scratch .
Well , old man , I'll tell you news of your son .
Otherwise , forgive me , but if you should die before him , what becomes of her dowry ?
I don't see any Thisbe .
Damn it , who's there ?
I come to ask you out of charity to let us wander over this bloody field to record the numbers of our dead and bury them , separating our nobles from the common men , for many of our princes , alas ! , lie drowned and soaked in the blood of mercenary soldiers .
They probably received warning about how much I stirred up the people .
True , if a fool such as yourself could find it .
I'll
I don't know what you're talking about .
Things are what they are .
A veteran commander and a very kind gentleman .
So go in peace .
Yes Signior ?
Do you understand what I'm saying , man ?
Therefore , you should obey their wishes .
We'll see about that !
I'll follow in the center of the troop formation , which I'll defend with my best horse , and with Saint George on my side , as well !
Their story is bizarre and astounding , but it's solid and consistent .
I swear , old fools become like babies again .
How are you , Roderigo ?
Keep up your courage , man !
What does the golden box say ?
I have it ready for you .
Who's that ?
Let heaven and men and devils tell me to shut me up .
Greetings , my lady , and may God always be with you .
Peace to you , my lord of Burgundy .
There's no power in Venice that can change an established decree .
Hope with good cause is swift ; it flies as fast as a swallow .
Yes , if I'm still alive , and you're still sane , and your dinner is worth eating .
Rise , princes , and , with a spirit of honor more sharply edged than your swords , rush to the battlefield : Charles Delabreth , High Constable of France ; you dukes of Orleans , Bourbon , Berri , Alencon , Brabant , Bar , and Burgundy ; Jaques Chatillon , Rambures , Vaudemont , Beaumont , Grandpre , Roussi , and Fauconberg , Foix , Lestrale , Bouciqualt , and Charolois .
I won't play the fool anymore and just cry while my husband and his man laugh at me .
Music , listen !
Canidius , take our nineteen
To hell with you !
Oh , this is cause for an extraordinary joy that should be engraved in gold on pillars to last forever .
It was carried to Colmekill to be placed in the tomb of his ancestors , where their bones are kept safe .
And so I'm dying .
The tyrant I'm serving now can go to hell !
Where's Antony ?
Lady Beatrice , have you been crying this entire time ?
If you behave yourself and join us in our circle dance and moonlight celebrations , then you can come with us .
You knew that my spirit was completely under your control and that I would ignore the gods' orders in favor of yours .
My wife's coming .
If they do fight , I hope Lysander is safe !
Receive all the blessings of a happy father .
Please allow her to do this .
You're kidding !
But I'll linger .
Farewell to you , and you , and you , Volumnius .
And I think that if I hadn't been brave and strong , she would have turned me into a dog and made me her slave .
Can you blame him ?
If she orders me to go , I'll thank her warmly as if she'd just offered to put me up for a week .
I'll kill myself out of grief !
Are you acting so boldly from hardship or because you despise good manners ?
Now , most noble Brutus , the gods are friendly with us today so that we , who want peace , can live on to old age !
Dear God , please make him normal again !
A friend ?
That's you , right ?
There's only one body here .
No , please , save it for dinner conversation .
But I can't be too obvious about being on your side without risking the life of your stepbrother , young George .
If you pursue it , this strict court of Venice will need to carry out the sentence against the merchant there .
Leah gave it to me before we were married .
Who calls so coldly ?
Where did you hear this ?
Don't disturb his soul .
This news is absolutely true : Mark Antony is expected to arrive in Rome at any hour now .
Where should we stable our horses ?
I know the man a bit .
I'm going , I'm going .
My mistress and her sister are waiting for you .
You're a lying , cowardly wretch .
Why so pale , my friend ?
But why couldn't I say "Amen" ?
No , you can't sign a contract like that for me !
The games are done and Caesar is returning .
Is everything ready for that event ?
Kneel down to the duke before he passes by the abbey .
But wait a minute .
Sir , it's the Moor .
I just did my duty , sir .
Well , I wish you liked me .
Amen to that , lady .
If they'll do neither , we'll come to them and make them fly like stones shot from powerful slings .
Ever since I've been a free agent in my choice of friends , I've chosen you because you take everything life hands you with calm acceptance , grateful for both good and bad .
I'll tell him all of this , dear lady .
If I took the kingdom from your sons , I'll give it to your daughter to make up for it .
What do you have to tell me ?
I'm here .
You all know this cloak .
Yes , if your memories do you no good .
Ha , ha , ha !
Yes , madam , but he'll be back tonight .
Come on , I'll escort you to dinner .
I stand here with the law on my side .
Speak , Pyramus. , Thisbe , come forward .
From now on I'll put up with my anguish until the anguish itself cries out , "Enough , enough ! " and disappears .
Everything's ready .
If I died right now I'd be completely happy , since I'll probably never be as happy as this again in my life .
I will proclaim my name around the field .
Come on , take control of your feelings .
By God , I order you to speak .
I hope things go well there .
I'll go and join my men .
I think you're an ass .
My brother , your uncle Antonio , just listen to this ( I still can't believe a brother could be so disloyal !
Come on , sweet Audrey .
Don't worry .
Oh , dear !
But for a fine , elegant , graceful , and excellent dress , yours is worth ten of those .
Yes , I will .
Let's play billiards .
They vanished strangely .
Yes , your Highness .
I'm not Cinna the conspirator .
Just you wait .
Yes , my lord .
She is welcome to stay .
Then let the rain come down .
It's Richard who sent us here to slaughter you .
I have done the deed .
I promise I'll carry the wood faster .
I am bound by oath , so please forgive me .
Here I lie and will never get up again .
No , my dear , you were a little angel who kept me going .
What have you done ?
Where are they ?
Send a message to his brother .
You've bet on the weaker fencer .
If it pleases you , your highness , why don't you sit with us and grace us with your royal company ?
I don't
Did he confess ?
Never a moment of peace !
Take him to the surgeons .
The East is very seductive .
Oh Clitus !
The tiring journey seems to have made you gloomy .
I'm dying for food , so let me have some .
Lady , did you sleep in her room last night ?
You're thinking something .
Speak .
Macbeth will never be defeated until Birnam Wood marches to fight you at Dunsinane Hill .
To hell with all worn-out horses , all crazy masters , and all bad roads .
You mean the man who used to be Othello ?
Your descendants will be kings , even though you will not be one .
Is she as tall as I am ?
We'll revenge his death .
And like I am for Rosalind .
Yes , it faded away when the rooster crowed .
I don't know why he's come here .
Men tend to be at their most irresponsible when they're away from home .
Dead .
I had a scar here that looked like a "T" ; now it's an "H." They're retreating .
Dear master , listen to me .
Here comes the good Macduff .
For three months .
He's been killed .
Yes , why shouldn't she ?
It is better to be tricked completely than to only suspect a little .
Her ladies-in-waiting saw her go to bed , and early this morning the bed was empty .
Go on .
Do you want to go in and join the party ?
Punish me if it's not true .
Bring out the stocks !
Sir , the laws of Ephesus will be on my side , and you'll be embarrassed .
Go out and feel what the impoverished feel .
Things have certainly changed !
And though his feelings may be pitched higher than ours , when they plummet , they plummet that much farther .
Girls , girls !
Listen to me , madam .
Yes , very well , sir .
I know who you are .
Well then , add some interjections that indicate laughter , like Hold on , Friar .
So I won't choose what many men desire , because I won't jump on the bandwagon and include myself with the whole crude population .
Whether your banquet is first or last , your Egyptian cooking will make it the best .
I've got something for you .
Yes , my lord .
Why did you send so many ?
As they pass by , grab Casca by the sleeve , and he'll tell you if anything important happened today , in his usual sour way .
Lord , what fools these mortals are !
Say anything .
I've got no hope that he survived .
Shame on you !
I know that voice .
Believe me , I'd rather have lost a purse full of gold coins .
A man no mightier than you or I in ability , yet grown as huge and frightening as tonight's strange happenings .
That light we see is coming from my hall .
Poor Tom has been scared out of his mind .
Here , sir ! " You stupid , unpolished dolts !
I should sit in the corner and sing that song , "Heigh-Ho for a Husband ! " Lady Beatrice , I'll get you a husband .
They're pretty busy in there .
When will there be another like him ?
I've heard about this indirectly , but I will send for him .
Why ?
Listen , Dardanius .
They're all dead .
God defend and guard us innocents against them !
It's not fair to punish me for something you make me do .
But I've often heard him argue that when sons are at their prime and their fathers are declining , the sons should be their fathers ' guardians and manage their fathers ' money .
That will never happen .
It's amazing , if I may say so , that she let herself be tamed .
Neighbors and friends , though we don't have anyone for the bride and bridegroom's places at the table , you know there's nothing missing in the feast itself .
There are parents living whose children you have butchered ; they are now old withered plants who will moan over their losses as they grow old .
You have offered me the lands of Sicily and Sardinia .
I'll have them sleep on cushions in my tent .
I dreamed last night that I feasted with Caesar , and unlucky signs overwhelmed my imagination .
You , I think , would best know what he's thinking .
Good night , my lord .
Why , he's the Prince's fool , and a very dull fool at that .
I don't care if you love me or not , I like the cap and I'll have it or I won't have any .
Casca , you'll be the first to raise your hand .
But I agree , sir , that we were locked out .
That's my way , when I see a crab-apple .
You're pale and trembling .
Here it is , I think .
Why is the Jew waiting ?
With all my heart , I'll join you .
I'm glad your father isn't alive to see this .
Don't tell us what our duty is .
Have I lost my wit ?
You're so neat and well put-together that you look like you love yourself more than anyone else .
A victory in battle is twice as victorious when all the soldiers return home safely .
If I can bear that pain , then I can bear my husband's secrets .
I'm ready to hear you .
Halt !
They're coming .
Though I said my name was Benedick , I heard this news with Claudio's ears .
We're available .
No , I'd rather be married to a skull with a bone in its mouth than to either of those men .
Don't try to tempt me !
Let me go with him .
Look how the moon seems to be sleeping with its lover and can't be awoken !
Well , do your best .
That you lift the death sentence on my servant , who killed a rowdy and belligerent former servant of the duke of Norfolk .
Right on cue , here's the duke himself .
Antonio will guarantee it , hmmm .
You're a pustule , a sore , a tumor digesting my bloodline .
Order them to escape .
You said it when you were furious .
But , really , what's going on , Clarence ?
Sir , your description of him doesn't detract from his good qualities , though I know that trying to list them all would make your head spin , and even so you wouldn't be able to keep up with him .
So young and so cruel ?
Take care of the lady .
But there's reason for me to look more closely at this schoolmaster .
Nobody but the fool , who's trying to soothe the wounds in the king's heart with jokes .
Yes , and it seemed twice as long to me , having been kept from your bed that whole time .
Is he enough of a man to wear a hat and grow a beard ?
What time is it ?
Good night , good brother .
Oh , he's a gallant king !
And if we don't shake hands , when I act all nice to the players it will seem like I'm happier to see them than you .
Who can explain this to me ?
I never talked with her in my life .
Take whatever wife you want to bed with you , You'll have a fool's head forever .
It'd be impossible for you to watch them , even if they were as horny as animals in heat and as stupid as drunks .
Please , hurry up .
That's the whore's curse , to seduce many men , but to be seduced by one .
He's coming , ma'am .
But will I wear these honors for only a day or will I enjoy them for a long time ?
Until her beautiful life's end .
I won't betray them .
And he had a chain that once belonged to you hanging around his neck .
If she admits she wanted this , then I won't blame Othello. , Come here , my child .
I've never known any woman or seen a woman's face , except my own in the mirror .
What ?
I never thought any less of him .
Every minute we expect more ships to arrive .
Well , I think that even if it weren't on record , the truth would be remembered from one generation to the next , all the way to Doomsday .
Hail , brave friend !
I am the son of Marcus Cato !
I suspect some foul play .
Carry him away .
Then he swore he was a stranger here .
Why do you say that ?
It would be wonderfully wise of you , my dear Reynaldo , to ask around about his behavior a little before you visit him .
I've left our luggage on the ship , and I bought the oil , balm , and liquor you wanted .
As good a reason as any .
My cousin Westmoreland ?
I came to Venice with a number of Antonio's creditors who say he won't be able to avoid going bankrupt .
I've seen her do it .
No more about that , please .
As my child , I order you to do so .
Oh , my dear Cassio !
If that's what you mean , I'll melt this gold and pour it down your throat that speaks these hateful words .
I'm not a traitor .
He wants the child for himself , to accompany him on his wanderings through the wild forests .
I won't speak to her .
Nobody was hurt in the slightest .
Unfortunately , I love myself .
Get them in here .
I pray that God ends his life before I die , so I can say , "The dog is dead ! "
It's time for me to say goodbye to you .
Damn him !
What's going on , Rosalind ?
Her grapes , which make the wine that cheers our hearts , die unpruned on the vines .
Who's that ?
Go back to bed .
It's "never get tired." Oh !
You aren't wood , you aren't stones , you're men .
I'm afraid to think how I'll be criticized for letting my natural affection for my father give way to my loyalty to you .
Where will we meet in the morning ?
I did .
Will my daughter be a good musician , do you think ?
Well then , here's more money for you .
Where is he ?
Or are we both on drugs ?
And hello to you , fair sister .
If I can just get him to drink one more glass after what he's drunk already , he'll be as argumentative and eager to fight as a little dog .
Leave now .
Mark Antony heard that you were preparing to wage war on him .
Your guardian angel is noble , courageous , significant , and unmatched when Caesar's not around .
People don't cry when they're mocking someone .
Here comes the Prince and Claudio .
It's as strange as this other thing which I don't understand .
Oh , what a mean low-life I am !
She'll be here soon , just like her letter said .
Caesar , you are revenged with the very same sword that killed you .
You'll hear more from me by midnight .
Sir and madam , to make grand speeches about what majesty is , what service is , or why day is day , night is night , and time is time is just a waste of a lot of day , night , and time .
So go and put your stamp on the girl .
May the gods destroy you !
Not a word .
Meanwhile I'll stay with Regan with my hundred knights .
They're really being spoken , sir , and they're true .
I work for Titania , the Fairy Queen , and organize fairy dances for her in the grass .
Where's my notebook ? , It's a good idea for me to write down that one can smile and smile , and be a villain .
Thank you , Ariel .
Don't mess with me .
All right , then .
In England this strange monster would be just like a man .
Indeed , she gives a very good testimony of the snake's power .
You seem to think no one outside of your bedroom knows what you wish .
Be quiet , you are Antonio .
Get busy , go !
But God forbid he says no to us !
That's it .
Armed , sir .
It would be better to die that way than to die from being mocked , which is as bad as being killed by tickling .
I'll take the Queen into my custody .
Young though I am , I've been observing these three blowhards closely .
If things go well , bring the crowd to I'm off .
If you shut the windows , it will pour out the keyhole .
Why do you keep repeating that , woman ?
One more thing , sir .
Where is he ?
Heaven help us !
Please invite them in .
It's fair game to mark a coward .
Pull them apart .
If she returns my jewels , I'll stop pursuing her and apologize to her .
Yes , she said that .
The senate has decided to give mighty Caesar a crown today .
What do you want , fellow ?
I'm not sad , my lord .
Yes , madam , twenty different messengers .
It's not in the contract .
My lady , will you have a dance with me ?
Cheer up , good Adam .
Absolutely , so long as he gets the girl .
How long has he been possessed like this ?
Tell me right now and stop fooling : where's the money ?
You might just as well say , "That's a valiant flea that dares to eat its breakfast on the lip of a lion." Yes , exactly .
I'll yield my legions and cavalry to Caesar .
And now that I have the boy , I'll undo the spell that makes her vision so disgustingly wrong .
Well , God bless this marriage !
Yes , your Majesty .
I hear him mock Caesar's luck , which the gods give to men in order to balance out their subsequent wrath .
This is old Ninny's tomb .
Would you like to be king of the entire world ?
Once I'm there , I won't need a guide anymore .
What , we're going to die ?
But what about your guilty conscience ?
Young people often lose their self-control even without any help from others .
I'll get some cloth and egg whites to bandage his bleeding face .
But if you remember , I didn't tell you to parody the style .
Master , should I watch the door ?
No doubt the murderous knife was blunt till it was sharpened on your stony heart , you reveled in my lambs ' bloody guts .
I did , sir , but it didn't answer me .
My heart feels like it's about to explode .
So she was moved by it ?
I told him what I thought .
It's not right to obey his orders to let him go alone .
I've done everything you accuse me of , and more , much more .
Do you really think so ?
Oh Lorenzo , if you keep your promise to me , I'll end this agony by becoming a Christian and marrying you .
It would be just like a nice daydream or fantasy .
Yes , noble lord .
But first I'll release the fairy queen from the spell .
Myself ?
If love has touched you , love has touched you , end of story .
Because Pyramus is a good-looking man , the most handsome man that you could find on a summer's day , a lovely gentlemanly man .
Master Constable , you're going about this all wrong .
Don't ever tell anyone what you've seen tonight .
Friends , go .
Yes , unfortunately .
Come , find the conspirators !
Bassanio , let him have the ring .
Let this solemn melody comfort your fevered minds , which are now useless , seething inside your skulls. , All of you stand there in my spell. ,
I didn't accuse you of lying .
Step aside .
Ratcliffe , come here .
Oh , to think that the same body that once ruled the world could now patch up a wall !
For heaven's sake , help me !
Of course we will .
I saw Bassanio sail away , and Gratiano went with him .
What worries have kept you awake tonight ?
How can it be ?
No , no , he's dead .
Saw who ?
Tranio , I think I've got it !
We owe you love and service forever .
Peaseblossom .
The sorrow that I feel actually belongs to you , and the high life you enjoy actually belongs to me .
I see him revive himself to praise my noble act .
A messenger has arrived from Caesar .
Is this my prize ?
You promised to take a full year off my sentence .
Oh , spite of spites !
Oh , look , sir , look , sir !
Give me your hand , and explain your situation to me .
The law has another hold on you .
Signor Brabantio , hey !
Don't harp on that point , madam , it's past .
One weakness led to another , to make me hate myself .
How did he try to persuade you to love him ?
Well , that's a fine answer .
Come on , good fellow , help me into that armor you're carrying .
And there's another storm brewing , I can hear it in the way the wind whistles .
Then I could stop wondering , and find some other career .
That's not the tune I had in mind .
No , no , I can't , really .
Then sing it .
After that , nothing can hurt him further , not weapons , poison , rebellion , invasion , or anything else .
Hastings loved the prince's father so much that we won't be able to persuade him to do anything against the prince .
I think he got his jacket in Italy , his tights in France , his hat in Germany , and his behavior everywhere .
I'm glad to see you in such a merry mood .
Mistress , your father requests that you leave your books and come help decorate your sister's room .
And mine say a hundred and forty .
I'll do it , if you help me out .
But Macbeth is .
Yes , if you want to help yourself .
Yes , you poor ghost , as long as I have any power of memory in this distracted head .
What do you want with her , sir ?
You swear never to mention what you've seen .
We're close enough now .
Just looking at you makes me sick .
Give me some light !
I haven't seen you since you sent me to the Centaur with the gold you gave me .
Come , help me bang on the door , master .
Decius Brutus doesn't love you .
If you're Stephano , touch me and speak to me .
Is there any more , or is that it ?
How much does he owe the Jew ?
Friends , come here .
Cleopatra , How could I have ever thought that you would be faithful and true , even though your vows of love shook the heavens themselves , you , who were unfaithful to Fulvia ?
Beware Macduff .
When you see leeks in the future , I hope you keep mocking them .
Venus went home again , and her little son broke all his arrows , swearing he'll never shoot them again , but play with birds like other little boys .
Goodbye to the horses and the trumpets and the drums , the flute and the splendid banners , and all those proud displays and pageantry of war !
Bring down that top sail !
Then there would be two cousins lying sick in bed : one hurt by reasons and the other gone crazy without any .
Flee ?
You have to read us the will , Caesar's will .
Will they see us ?
No , I swear I'm not .
That's it !
The king will be angry with him .
Please , don't speak to him .
Enough , enough .
Get out of my sight !
Even if we don't fight foreign enemies , we'll beat down these rebels at home .
Why "let it strike" ?
That may be true , my lord .
Why ?
What do you say ?
No , no , put your hat back on .
My letters say only seventy senators were killed , one being Cicero .
You have broken my heart .
Yes , he was .
No , Caesar doesn't have epilepsy .
How's that ?
We are destined to be betrayed when we are born .
Well then , I know who you are .
Must I bite ?
Have you forgotten who I am ?
Tell me , you villainous lowlife , where are my children ?
Set it down awhile .
Well , hello there , Horatio !
A likely story !
He has an uncle here in Messina who will be glad to hear this news .
Come here , sir .
Was it mine ?
I don't care what he told you in Latin .
Isn't every living thing condemning her ?
Forgive my boldness if I take you up on your words about making magic .
That way I can conquer my own fear and sleep easy at night .
Go home to bed , Francisco .
Do you have in there the pretty snake of the Nile that kills without pain ?
What work can you do ?
And do you see how much your foolish wife means to him ?
May you choke on any other sentiments like that !
They keep up Adam's profession .
Who are these people ?
I leave a slimy bastard with you , your Worship , for you to punish and make an example of .
I want to head out tonight .
We would have liked to have heard your good advice , which has always been serious and helpful , at the council today , but we'll wait until tomorrow .
Have them come in front of the master constable .
Go tell the priests to perform a sacrifice immediately , and bring me their interpretation of the results .
You attract me to you , you cruel magnet !
They pulled out the guts of the sacrificed animal and couldn't find its heart .
Did heaven watch the slaughter and not send down any help ?
Calphurnia cried out three times in her sleep , "Help , someone !
And why do you blame me for loving you ?
I've never seen a creature with a human shape who was so eager to destroy a man .
Gracious King Edward has sent us noble Siward and ten thousand soldiers .
Is it on record that he built it , or is it just word of mouth ?
You're right .
You'll never find her without an answer unless you find her without a tongue .
It doesn't matter .
Look at you , standing there in a stupor !
It was Kent , sir , the exiled Kent , who , after the king treated him like an enemy of the state , put on a disguise and followed his king , carrying out tasks unworthy of even a slave .
Why are you silent ?
They've switched their operation to the sea today .
Let Caesar do whatever he wants .
The whole world could look at you , and no one would be as blind as he is , thinking you're beautiful .
If the Jew cuts deep enough , I'll pay it instantly with all my heart .
Please go , sir .
Shame on you !
I had my father's signet ring in my pocket , with the royal seal of Denmark on it .
I'll come at you with the old proverb : "Should I make myself at home ? "
It was obviously a hit .
Sleep well there on the ground .
I tell you , though , it's incredible how much she loves me .
Hello , Tubal .
Where is kind Hastings ?
If that's not enough , I'll sign a contract to pay ten times that much , and I'll give you my hands , my head , and my heart as security .
All hail , Macbeth !
It's as common for us old people to assume we know more than we do as for young people to be too wild and crazy .
May God , who is the best matchmaker , join your hearts and realms in one .
Repent and avoid damnation .
If you leave like that , you tell the world that it's not worthy of a good-bye .
followed you on your sad wanderings , ever since your bad luck began .
I might wake you up in a while to send you on an errand to my brother Cassius .
Right now we're shaken up by fears and doubts .
And were you then happy to find shelter on a bed of hay along with swine and homeless bums ?
I think I've found one already , thanks to you , my lord .
The work we enjoy is not really work .
On , on , you noblest Englishmen , descended as you are from battle-tested fathers , fathers who , like so many Alexander the Greats , have fought in these regions from morning until night , sheathing their swords only when there was no one left to fight .
It's nobler to leap in ourselves than dawdle until they push us .
No , I'll help too .
It probably has something to do with, I don't know .
Please make him change his mind .
Make these men work .
She will be pleased .
Before you got so angry , I never would have thought that .
It's a skull with a scroll in its empty eye socket .
Grumio gave the order for how it should be done .
If I were in England now , like I was once , and I had even a painted picture of this fish , every fool there would give me a piece of silver to look at it .
Let me see them .
Tom's chilly .
He answered , "You penniless bastard !
Have you heard anything to the contrary ?
These are tricks of the imagination , and this place is filled with magicians .
Sextus Pompeius is sailing toward the port of Rome .
You are very welcome here , sir .
Horny animals !
You lie , you nasty , ungrateful thing !
Tie up his withered old arms .
Let me take my chances .
When things are at their worst they have to stop , or else improve to the way things were before .
There is a poor old man who , purely out of love , has limped after me for miles .
You should be ashamed , generals !
My brother whom , aside from you , I loved more than anyone else in the world , I trusted to run my state , which at that time was the strongest in the land , and Prospero the number one duke , famous for my dignity and my education .
I haven't come to steal your loyalty , friends .
Look , how she blushes like a virgin !
We will , my noble lord .
Stop her !
I won't have one any bigger .
Go , Pindarus , climb a little higher on this hill .
This disrespectful stance toward the man who is your lord , your king , your governor tarnishes your beauty the way the frosts of winter blights the land .
Who else should it be ?
Time to buy myself a mirror and employ a few dozen tailors to dress me up in the current fashions .
That way , he'll waste his provisions and tire out his soldiers , weakening his own capacities , while we , lying still , are rested , energetic , and nimble .
Cleopatra recognizes your greatness and accepts your authority .
She was lying even as she was going down to hell .
But you're wrong .
No , your words are too precious to be wasted on dogs .
She's yours. , Come , Ariel !
He's not your relative .
If I come back from the battlefield again to kiss those lips , I'll be covered in blood .
Silvius , keep your promise to marry Phoebe if she refuses me .
Where ?
But did you listen to all that poetry without even wondering about what your name is doing on all these trees ?
Where is Gloucester ?
This doesn't look like a wedding .
That's enough for one lesson .
And I'm going to sleep .
She can't hurt you , Helena .
No , don't hit him , lieutenant !
My beautiful warrior !
The best plays are still only illusions , and the worst are just as good , if you just use your imagination to fill them in .
His feelings don't move in that direction .
Look , my little spirit is sitting in a foggy cloud waiting for me .
Next thing you know , he'll be saying "widower Aeneas." "Widow Dido , " did you say ?
Look , if you really love the beautiful Hero , enjoy it .
Therefore , love and tongue-tied simplicity can say the most even when they're saying the least , in my opinion .
If there's any reason we shouldn't get married , I urge you to tell me .
My new master is expecting your approach .
Mark Antony will say I'm not well , and to please you I'll stay at home .
If I'm more noble than you , you've done me wrong .
This is a rotten song to sing at a man's funeral .
It's only going to make you sad , Monsieur Jaques .
When you have to steal your own wives some day , I'll wait for you just as long .
Could my good brother-in-law , a man to whom the
My lord , no one will believe this in Venice , even though I'd swear I saw it with my own eyes .
What , are we having a feast ?
We'll leave you here .
The name of Cassius gives credit to these corrupt actions , and so they go unpunished .
I'll get her , but I won't keep her long .
Treason !
That I won't stand for .
This is the inventory of the money , silverware , dishes , and jewels that are still in my possession .
Then may your daughters be cursed with all the horrible fates that await sinners !
I'm leaving your court now .
The man that once sold the skin of a lion while the beast still lived died hunting him .
still fight you and embed your lies back in your hellish heart. , Trumpets , blow !
Don't go , " says my conscience .
I hope for my brother's sake that he just wrote it to test my honor .
I hope you're not trying to cheat me .
Where is he ?
This last course here is for closing up the stomach after great feasting .
You can judge for yourself what I mean .
How does it go with my magnificent Mark Antony ?
I'll write how , under his flag and with his well-paid troops , we have beaten the formerly unvanquished Parthia .
Truly , no , no more than is reasonable .
Tell him a messenger has arrived from my master with good news .
Greetings , good general !
Today Pompey laughs away his fortune .
I'd rather be a slave or a packhorse for this hateful stablehand here .
Antipholus owes me the exact amount that I owe you .
We'll do our duty to you , sir .
My situation is desperate .
Agree to swear .
There are tears for his love , joy for his fortune , honor for his bravery , and death for his ambition .
Well , well , let's go .
I slept well , ate well , and was happy .
you , as sure as your name's Roderigo , if I were the Moor I wouldn't want to be Iago .
Do we have devils on the island ?
Go ahead , swear to that , so you'll be damned to hell for lying .
Pour in the blood of a sow who has eaten her nine offspring .
And as for my soul , how can the ghost endanger that , since it's as immortal as the ghost is ?
Cover the sky with a low-hanging fog , as dark as hell , and get these overeager rivals so completely lost in the woods that they can't run into each other .
Eros , would you like to look through a window in Rome and watch your master marching in Caesar's victory parade , his arms crossed and tied , his head bowed in submission , his face red from shame , while the chariot of triumphant Caesar precedes him , putting the final stamp to his humiliation ?
Good Metellus , go to him now .
I did too , and he also swore he would marry her tonight .
What's that noise ?
We have to go out and talk to them .
Oh yes , you spoke , my lord , but total nonsense .
The poor thing !
And where's Cordelia ? , Do you see this , Kent ?
Yes , just as great and just as recent .
This is the plague of important men , our wives betray us more than those of poor men .
Miranda. , Oh father , I've disobeyed you by telling him that !
Never , my lord .
I'm coming .
She's dead , my Queen .
Also , you're supposed to visit all the bars and tell anyone who's drunk to go home and go to bed .
I admire your efforts , and all of you will share the rewards .
I'm terribly sleepy .
Hello and God bless you , sir .
In just an hour from now , Duchess of York , I'll be saluting you as the mother of two beautiful queens .
The voice kept crying , "Sleep no more ! " to everyone in the house .
She's probably right .
Goodbye then , Hero .
Go on !
Oh , no .
In that case , I ask that for the sake of friendship and alliance you let that one item stand with the rest , and bestow your daughter on me .
Please , tell me some of them .
My name is Pistol .
Please , try to act a little more serious , or the people in Belmont will get the wrong impression about me , and your wildness will make me blow my chance with Portia .
Death didn't conquer
You've got it wrong , old man .
What's going on , daughter ?
I guess not , for good reason , as you'll soon hear .
I do indeed , my lord .
Did you see how he laughed about sleeping with her ?
Let's follow him .
The Duke's in a meeting right now , and he's sent for you too .
I was his daughter when your Highness took my father's dukedom .
Who's that coming ?
Go away , get out of here , and stop following me .
If I decide to get angry at you , just watch out , You'd be done for then , monster .
Go away now and in the morning meet me in the pit by the river in hell .
We'll both be safer if we go separate ways .
If you say it isn't true , I'll give you a province and make you rich .
Damned Iago !
You're bothering me .
You can't stay here any longer .
It's pretty .
There is a man who loves you better than your husband could .
So , in God's name , let's march .
I don't know where he's staying , so if I told you he's sleeping here or there , I'd be lying .
That's for sure .
Has the storm passed ?
Oh my God , what a terrible world this is !
Lepidus flatters both of them , as they flatter him , but he doesn't love them , and they don't love him .
Go on ahead .
Lucillius and Titinius , order the commanders to have the men camp for the night .
Claudio !
You're not going to take him .
One more time , we proclaim this publicly : If anyone will pay this man's bail , he will not be put to death .
Why , what's the problem ?
There's not a strand of feather left in our whole army , a good sign , I hope , that we won't fly away like birds , and time on the field has made us slovenly .
But I'm a hired hand : I don't profit from the flocks I tend .
I wouldn't do it for a nice ring , or fine linen , or pretty gowns or petticoats or hats .
Will you meet me right away at Ninny's grave ?
I really want to sleep now .
Assemble our squadrons on the other side of the hill , in sight of Caesar's navy .
Give me your hand .
What are these warlike noises ?
Look here , this is the entrance to his room .
I wish we were safely on board our ship already .
Let's look in his pockets .
He woke up the whole house with his loud and cowardly screams .
Along with this strange power , he also has the gift of prophecy and various other abilities .
Well , let's hope your good fortune continues !
Give me an aphrodisiac , pharmacist .
A man old Frederick , your father , loves .
Let me have your attention for a moment .
And I departed in a rage , right ?
We're probably a very valuable catch for these guys .
Though he seems a little old-fashioned , there is much care and courage in this Welshman .
Indeed , it's a strange time .
Light the candles !
I'll moan very believably. , Name the other actors. , But I'm really in the mood to play a tyrant .
What foolish thief brags about his crimes ?
I could rhyme like that for eight years in a row , excepting meal times and sleeping hours .
Yes , here it is .
I want you to see the difference between us , so I pardon you even before you ask for a pardon .
But please , tell me the worst thing that could happen to me if I refuse to marry Demetrius .
That's the way to do it !
Amen to that !
Their illness confounds the most advanced techniques of modern medicine , but when he touches them , they heal immediately because of the power granted to him by heaven .
I remember , Adam , that's Here comes my master , your brother .
Soldier , you are .
Get a little sleep .
You should know , my friends , that I have good hopes for tomorrow , and that I will lead you as if I expect victory rather than an honorable death .
Shame on you ; I've already run out of patience with you all .
This is no way to treat a host who has welcomed you into his house .
As for myself , it was Greek to me .
That's not what I wish .
If you won't listen to reason , I'll have to die .
My heart adores him , even though my tongue curses him .
My letters are ready to go .
I want very much to find out .
When he wakes up !
Please be quiet .
Follow them straight to the cottage .
How's the queen ?
Let it fly out .
Let's have more sex in the world , since Gloucester's bastard son was kinder to him than my daughters , conceived in lawful wedlock , have been to me .
Pass on the command to halt !
If he doesn't like it , he can go live with my sister .
What do you mean ?
The play's the thing to uncover the conscience of the king .
Let me tell you , friends ,
If I can disguise my voice as well as my appearance , then I'll be able to carry out my plan perfectly .
I wish I were , so I could deprive you of both day and life .
I don't know you .
Medicine is for the dogs .
I didn't do anything wrong that I know of , unless it was a sin to defend myself when someone attacked me .
I've got nothing to do with you .
They shouted three times .
Oh , he's been betrayed , and I've been ruined .
She's as dead as the cold ground .
It seems to me like we're still sleeping , still dreaming .
We come to hate that which controls us .
The royal tree has left us other fruit , which , with time , will do just fine on the throne and make us all happy as king , I'm sure .
The container of that great soul is now cold .
So were their daggers , which we found on their pillows , unwiped .
I'll go now to find out the date of the wedding .
We haven't been able to meet on a hill or in a valley , in the forest or a meadow , by a pebbly fountain or a rushing stream , or on the beach by the ocean without you disturbing us .
Good-bye .
Brutus killed me .
You represented yourself as just a common man .
Imagine the French ambassador returning to inform Harry that the king offers him
Just now , my lord .
The best thing to do is crawl under his cloak .
Your words are idiotic .
Give me the gown .
Is it possible to be wise , bewildered , calm , furious , loyal , and neutral all at once ?
This land will belong to your and Albany's children forever. , And now what does my second daughter Regan , the wife of Cornwall , have to say ?
They are my daylight , my life .
I will .
Great Queen Juno is coming .
Make sure the ones who have wronged you suffer too .
Queen Margaret saw your sword steaming with his blood .
We just want you to answer to your real name .
It's the truth .
If I can't have an estate by birthright , then I'll get it by being clever .
Ely joining Richmond troubles me more than Buckingham and his quickly assembled army .
Taurus !
I think this night is just like sick daylight .
You get trickier and trickier .
They probably put him up to killing old man Gloucester to get his money .
She's weak and will die unless you comfort her .
Speak , if you can .
You are the best of the cutthroats .
Has it come to this ?
Oh , my heart , my heart is rising into my throat !
My Will you come on , cousin ?
Come on , men !
What's the matter ?
And if they don't find charity there , they find it someplace else .
My fears can't actually make you evil .
Yawn , snore .
What time is it ?
We haven't yet encountered that danger , and the best thing to do is avoid it entirely .
Your answers are too shallow and too hasty .
God knows I loved my niece , and now she's dead , slandered to death by cowards who would just as likely fight a real man as I would grab a poisonous snake by the tongue .
I'll chop her into pieces .
Oh , my bad luck has forced honest men to become traitors .
You brazen whore !
She cheated on me , and she was a whore .
Please , remain seated .
Why are you here ?
Please hire Cassio again .
But gilded tombs contain worms .
Shall we go send them food and fresh clothing and feed their starving horses before we fight them ?
Don't be quick to pick a fight , but once you're in one , hold your own .
Come on , my lord .
My plans are almost at their climax .
I want my bond .
Oh , how wonderful to see you !
The man who finds the sweetest rose Will be pricked by it , and by Rosalind .
Duke Solinus , my husband , and both my children , and you two Dromios , who marked the day of my sons ' births with your own , come into the abbey with me for a new christening .
I'd risk my soul for that .
Who's shouting "murder" ?
But wait , what's that sound ?
He's just Launcelot .
What's the prize ?
He brings me freedom .
The life" ?
Do you know me ?
Let's speak to him .
You resent my friends ' rise in society , and my own .
If you ever loved me , then please postpone the sweet relief of death awhile , and stay in this harsh world long enough to tell my story .
So , take me , death !
Now , Titania , wake up , my sweet queen .
Amen .
How did this happen ?
Justice , find the girl !
Two reasons .
Take out your sword and come on .
Goodbye .
I'll be off before you are .
Do you see ?
I will .
Or if you haven't broken away from human company , as my feelings now lead me to do , you haven't loved .
I don't like his face .
Good sir , as a friend , I advise you to leave this place .
He who is dizzy thinks the world is spinning .
What was it that you told me today , that your niece Beatrice was in love with Signior Benedick ?
No , it is not possible you should love the enemy of France , Kate .
Goodbye .
But , oh no !
This would be enough to make my husband suspect me , if he wasn't so free of jealousy .
Metellus Cimber ?
Name them .
I thank you all for your trouble and courtesy .
You think she gave it to Cassio ?
The king made peace among all of us .
And to hell with drowning yourself !
Here , Peter Quince .
I was not myself , as a result of the wine .
Oh , stop , fool .
Why Dover ?
I won't live long enough , and all my efforts will fail me .
Good-bye , until you return tonight .
Then I will kiss your lips , Kate .
She's the daughter of this famous Duke of Milan I heard so much about but never saw before .
Don't do it , sir .
Having already thought about the fact that she would have to die sometime , I can endure her death now .
Since you left , I've been enjoying the sweetest sleep and most promising dreams I've ever had , my lords .
Come here , Ventidius .
The king was wearing exactly this armor when he fought the king of Norway .
Richard loves Richard , that is , there's just me and myself here .
Where is he ?
How did you like the young German , the duke of Saxony's nephew ?
I wasn't invited because they like me .
I'll pull on these smaller legs .
Doesn't that rising blush suggest that she is virtuous and innocent ?
Your father is a sailmaker in Bergamo .
Two of them are completely honorable , and if they have been tricked in this , we must blame John the Bastard , who lives to create conflict .
You've only insulted yourself .
You think it's a big deal that this fierce storm is soaking me to the skin .
I have to leave right away .
Admit you were wrong .
Neither good nor bad .
There's no reason to be afraid .
Call me when it's lit .
Laertes , I want you to hear what they say .
Go and tell my daughter I want to speak with her .
In that case , I think Cassio's an honest man .
We've got to give them and take them , my lord .
You can't judge me based on what I do tonight .
She's not going to borrow money from them .
When we're by ourselves you can call me "Tranio." Everywhere else , address me as your master Lucentio .
Please , give me that goblet , if you love me .
I'm helping Indeed , sir , find something better to do and get lost for a while .
Just one glass .
But for one reason they refused to execute her .
Their dying shouts broke my heart !
That way we can conceal how many of us there are , and Macbeth's spies will give him inaccurate reports .
Oh dear gods !
I'll go straight for that proverb with "To hell with the devil." You are better at proverbs than I am by as much as "A fool shoots quickly and overshoots his mark." You have overshot .
My uncle ?
Now , Balthazar , you've always been honest and faithful to me , and I trust you still are .
Isn't their ingratitude like the mouth biting the hand that feeds it ?
The owl made noise all night .
Round enough to be unattractive .
Go tell the hunters to blow their horns and wake them up .
But if it overwhelms you to look at Caesar's wounded cloak , how will you feel , kind men , now ?
Now , my lord , what are we going to do if we find that Lord Hastings won't go along with our plans ?
What do you mean by "carriages" ?
The nine Muses mourning the death of learning and scholarship." That's some sharp , critical satire , and it's not appropriate for a wedding .
Tell your master there is no sound basis for his worries .
Isn't it strange , Canidius , that he could cross the Ionian Sea so quickly from Tarentum and Brundusium and take Toryne ? , Have you heard about this , sweet ?
Now you sound like a man .
So I'm free .
What are the chances of his getting better , lords ?
The devil's advice is nicer .
Let's shake on it .
Your Brutus ordered me to give it to you , and I'll do what he says .
Anything .
Your shoes are in pretty bad shape .
My sweet Cassio !
And when she was here recently she flirted with Edmund and gave him significant glances .
He speaks roughly , but what he says is smart , and his roughness makes other people enjoy listening to him .
You can have a whole story , not just a word .
But I'm afraid we'll never get him to agree to be king .
It's time for you to know the whole story .
I did them for Edward's sake , and look how he rewards me. , Oh God , if my prayers don't satisfy you , and you have to avenge the wrongs I've done , at least punish me alone !
That's a poor example .
Do my simple features please you ?
I hope I enjoy wearing it , for my heart is very heavy .
I don't care .
Yes .
Who's next ?
How can you stand there shamelessly talking about me and Hippolyta , when you know that I know about your love for Theseus ?
What did they do wrong ?
She was filthy !
Fight ?
I wouldn't want to stay here and make you angry .
Why , Dromio ?
Look , I don't love you , so stop following me around .
It would be wrong for me to think poorly of my grandmother .
Is he standing or sitting ?
That's a stupid thing to say .
Leave it alone , you fool .
What's that noise ?
But if
I'll be no king of England if I'm not also king of France .
We argued about which was best , and now we won't get either one .
First , he said you had no right to him .
I'm in a good mood now and likely to give you what you want .
I wonder that none of you thought about getting his support .
He liked to call me a loan shark ; let him think about his debt to me .
Edmund is dead , my lord .
Wait for mine , sweet soul .
Not even to get her fan , or her gloves , or her mask , or anything ?
Tunis has never had such a beautiful queen .
It's better that you didn't kill him .
Go find him .
But , tell me , where is the noble Richmond now ?
Don't shed even one tear .
I would not .
In God's name , speak .
You do the same , wherever the crowds are thick .
But here's an old , true saying : "If you want to win France , start with Scotland." For when the eagle England leaves her nest to seek prey , the weasel Scot always comes sneaking around to suck dry her princely eggs and , like the mouse when the cat's away , destroy more than she can actually eat .
I saw her , but I didn't notice her .
I do , Mark Antony .
Goodbye .
God protect me from these two !
As for myself , I didn't dare laugh , for fear of opening my lips and inhaling the stinking air .
Your mistress's marks ?
Is that a good idea , do you think ?
You'll find out everything in due time .
If the other two are as loopy as we are , our country's in bad shape .
Your royal father is murdered .
Gremio , this is no time to compete over how deeply we love Bianca .
Thank you .
There was even more foolishness , if I could only remember it .
Why are they running away ?
Aren't things going well ?
What , from myself ?
Then if he loses , it'll be his swan song , music before the end .
Leave me quickly .
Look at the three little dogs , Tray , Blanch , and Sweetheart , all barking at me .
Why ?
No , my dearest love , I wouldn't cheat you for the whole world .
To be brief , as the occasion requires , prepare to fight early in the morning , when your future will be decided .
No , I didn't say that .
They're like stomachs and we're just the food .
Yes , I'll wipe my mind clean of all trivial facts and memories and preserve only your commandment there .
Let's get started right away .
His kiss is as holy as bread blessed by a priest .
But you see my finger doesn't have the ring on it .
Come on , shovel .
Has Caesar gone to the Capital yet ?
Where did you learn that song , Fool ?
Just keep your love under control , and don't let yourself become a target of his lust .
Get up .
So it's no surprise that Demetrius runs away from me as if I were a monster .
I thought the king preferred the Duke of Albany to the Duke of Cornwall .
Let me see , let me see .
Wrong , evil traitor .
Who's that ?
Now I know better .
I am Benedick .
I folded up the new document , signed it , sealed it , and put it safely back so that no one noticed any difference .
How old are you , friend ?
Where do you think he is now ?
Oh no !
My thanes and kinsmen , I name you all earls , the first earls that Scotland has ever had .
Our troops are deployed tomorrow .
Some dungeon .
My God , who knows ?
I don't know .
Stand back , boy .
Yes , my lord , and calfskin too .
Not yet .
I know what I'm talking about .
He's left them to you and to your heirs forever , public pleasures in which you will be able to stroll and relax .
Pish !
She is our principal demand , one of the first points of the treaty .
Neighbors , hello .
get his position and use him to hurt Othello at the same time ?
This way , my lord .
Indeed , my lord , he is a perfectly wonderful horse .
Me , "greedy" !
I have important business that requires me to remain in disguise a while longer .
Authority .
I think of as many things as he does , but I just thank heaven and don't show off about it .
Drink when I order you , servant-monster .
In my soul , I believe Hero has been falsely accused .
Please let me know your plan , Bassanio .
Then do so , with all your heart .
I'll leave him alone .
And whoever is most irritated by my foolishness has to laugh the hardest .
Come on , then .
This poor virgin isn't much to look at , sir , but she's mine .
Yes , Cassius .
Here is the count of the slaughtered French .
Are you scared ?
Lend me your cloak , Sir Thomas .
Change into better clothes .
Good Hermia , please don't act so bitter toward me .
It's too bad .
Why , dear me , Kate !
In Algiers , sir .
I know I ought to obey my husband , but not now .
Please , don't forget to leave me a tip .
Well , that's just greedy .
In this day and age , if a man doesn't erect his own monument before he dies , he won't be remembered past the funeral bell's ringing and his widow's crying .
What could my sister's letter to him say ?
He rushed away on serious business .
Here , Peter Quince .
Whoosh !
You're under arrest , sir .
Fool , do not flatter yourself .
When did she send you ?
It's not lost , but what if it were ?
Easy , Petruchio .
A good laugh .
Caesar , beware of Brutus .
Who's calling ?
Then lay that sentence on me too , my lord .
Yes , that's the way I'll do it .
God should keep me from false friends , but they weren't false .
Gave me , sir ?
Out , out , brief candle .
Unfaithful , my lord ?
I led them on in this frightened , distracted state , and left sweet
How are you , Charmian ?
She's more cunning than anyone can imagine .
The king , the king's to blame .
Come out , I order you .
Then you have to say , "I take you , Rosalind , to be my lawfully wedded wife." I take you , Rosalind , to be my lawfully wedded wife .
She doesn't have anything going for her so far .
As for the food , it will be served in covered dishes .
He just said that they're no good at acting .
Lay her in the ground , and let violets bloom from her lovely and pure flesh !
I'll read you a sermon .
Even if you're not a traitor , you're going to look like one if you run away .
I swear , I think my wife's faithful , and I think she's not .
Wait , and listen to me , countrymen .
Was he pale or flushed and red-faced ?
But two men complimenting each other is like two baboons getting together .
Plantagenet .
No , you have to swear it .
It means peace and love and a quiet life , supremacy based on reverence and profound respect , and , not to go on and on about it , everything that's sweet and happy .
What do you want ?
But I bet Fortinbras will win the election to the Danish crown .
I beg you , listen well .
What endeavor , Popillius ?
Come here .
Don't trust rotten planks .
Make it eight and eight .
These child actors are now in fashion , and they've so overtaken the public theaters that society types hardly come at all , they're so afraid of being mocked by the playwrights who write for the boys .
You go pale , you stare , and you act in awe of the strange disturbance in the heavens .
Look with your ears .
Finally , the ceremony done , he called for wine .
Thanks to your majesty .
Yes , and don't let anyone come in , or else I'll break your head .
I know who you are .
Is that enough of an answer ?
Are your tears wet ?
How did you lose your breath ?
And I'll neigh like a horse and bark like a hound and grunt like a pig and roar like a bear and burn like a fire at every turn .
Mighty duke , please allow me to say something .
I won't bet on whether or not any of this is real .
I want this to provoke confrontations , so I can give him a piece of my mind .
What could you possibly ask for ?
Oh , come on , woman .
Please take them .
How's the night going , boy ?
Amen to that , from the bottom of my heart .
Tell me what I want to know .
Oh , conspiracy , are you ashamed to show your face even at night , when evil things are most free ?
Where have you sent the king ?
God , what a burden on you I must have been !
And didn't I finally arrive to comfort you ?
Then , gentlemen , we can count on trouble .
A mischievous child .
I have the authority to dismiss this court , unless Bellario comes today .
His legs aren't great , but they're alright .
But why did you tempt the heavens like that ?
To show you that that's me , let me prove it a little even in this case .
Did I do anything good to myself ?
But quiet , be quiet a minute .
Well then , tomorrow night , or Tuesday morning .
My leg's been cut in two .
Leave me alone now , Iago .
I won't fight you .
Will you take me , my lady ?
He smiled and said , "The better for us." He's right , and that's how it is .
Everything that made me worry about my ships would make me sad .
I'll humor him when he learns how to behave .
It'll be lunchtime within an hour .
Be careful , Signior Baptista , lest you be made the dupe in this business .
Well , I'll get married one day , just to see .
Be tough , " says the devil , "and run ! " But then my conscience , hanging around my heart , says very wisely to me , "My good friend Launcelot , you're a good boy , the son of an honest man , " really , that should be the son of an honest woman , since my father cheated on my mother .
Oh , how I love you !
Silvius , tell this youth what it means to be in love .
Escape and make peace with Caesar .
It is .
What , you don't want me to be chaste ?
Though I expect she'll wear me out more quickly than I'll wear out what I'm wearing , which will be good for her and even better for me !
Have a good life .
A nice coincidence , my lord .
Yes , my lord .
By God , I will tell the king about these taunts .
Good .
Your beautiful eyes , sweet lady , have infected mine with love .
You need to learn what ants know well about winter , there's no point in slaving away if there's no hope for profit .
Before I learn how to love , I'll learn how to follow orders .
Oh , heaven , how did she get out ?
Calphurnia !
A nice , soft pillow would be a more suitable place to lay that good white head than France's hard , cold ground .
She's round , like a globe .
Among the ten thousand the French have lost only sixteen hundred are mercenaries .
All of us have reason to mourn the dimming of our shining star the king .
Where are your sister and Hortensio's wife ?
Please , father , I beg you .
And that's everything , Leonato. , Claudio , Benedick , my dear friend Leonato has invited you all to stay here at Messina .
I swear by this hand and my father's soul , the whole thing is a disaster .
Amen to that , Gonzalo .
Why , what symptoms of love does she exhibit ?
Out of the frying pan and into the fire , from a tyrant duke to a tyrant brother !
Goodbye to my happiness !
The duke of Gloucester , who has command over the siege , is in consultation with an Irishman , a very valiant gentleman indeed .
I don't want her .
How can that be ?
No doubt , no doubt .
Pay for something I never got ?
No more than twenty-five .
Should I say to you , "Set them free !
I recognize the handwriting .
While we were here guarding you as you slept , we heard a loud roar that sounded like bulls , or lions .
Oh , if only we had with us here ten thousand of those men back home in England who aren't working today .
I'm not a traitor , unfair lady .
Though I am not a flattering , righteous man , at least you can say that I am honest about being a villain .
I'll use Albany's power and authority for now to win the war , but afterward one of the sisters , whichever one wants to , can get rid of him .
Please , tell me your cure .
I know his eyes are worshiping some other woman , or why wouldn't he be here ?
Oh , my lady , I'm ashamed to admit it .
Fresh beauty attracts thugs and thieves even more than money .
Killed ?
I'll play the part wearing either a straw-colored beard , or a sandy beard , or a red beard , or one of those bright yellow beards that's the color of a French coin .
Making your loss greater makes the person who caused it worse .
He begs you to spare his life .
If it pleases Caesar to be so good to himself as to hear me , I'll try to get him to do what's good for him .
A million goodbyes to you .
Bring him in front of me .
Please treat my babies well .
Let him come forward .
Den it shall also content me .
You're not going anywhere .
There must be a strange explanation for this , if it's true .
Oh , quick , before I'm gone .
I don't think he wants to be disturbed .
Hello , sir .
Is that called for in the contract ?
If you'd like to talk tomorrow , I'll come to your home .
Get somebody strong to carry him out of here .
Yes , the state's half can be reduced , but not Antonio's .
We'll go forward with you and meet them at Philippi .
I say you're not .
When the time comes , tell the herald to blow the trumpet and I'll return .
The wind's whipping up the waves so high you expect them to reach the clouds and splash against the stars in the sky .
I'll talk with this good man .
What's that noise ?
And he's still warm , by God .
But I still have a little memory left , and there's still some fire in my eyes ; my dull , deaf ears can still hear a little .
Heaven keep you safe !
I wish I'd been there .
I'll go get my sister and see what she thinks .
I would've been happy if the whole army had had sex with her , the lowest-ranking grunts and all , as long as I didn't know anything about it .
Nothing but cruel daughters could have degraded him like this .
Sir , you're old .
Who does he accuse ?
Some people will laugh at anything , and others are so grouchy they won't even crack a smile when they hear something hysterically funny .
Here's where they'll end up , on the floor .
Get down on your knees and thank heaven for sending you such a good man .
What's that ?
Well , I hope you stay in that frame of mind or some poor man will end up with his face all scratched up .
The armies were like two exhausted swimmers clinging to each other and struggling in the water , unable to move .
I am indebted to you for your last sermon .
I feel better already , and I know there's more good advice where that came from .
Yes , ma'am .
If people take what he says , fine .
Who's calling me ?
That's why your daughter and son-in-law are punishing me shamefully .
If you don't mind , I'd like to speak with you .
Then I guess I was misled .
My door is locked .
Tell me .
I didn't see him .
Which one is it ?
Look how cheerful my mother is , only two hours after my father died .
Go !
Let's proceed to the field .
You were supposed to be proving that there isn't time for everything .
He's like a huge wheel on the top of the highest mountain whose spokes touch the rim of ten thousand smaller things , when it falls down the mountain , every little object goes down with it .
And yet I think you look with your eyes just like every other woman does .
I smile and think , "Thank goodness the wind doesn't flatter me : it's like a councilor who makes me feel what I'm really made of." Adversity can have its benefits , like the ugly , poisonous I wouldn't change my situation for anything .
Half of your wealth goes to Antonio .
Why are you mumbling to yourself instead of answering the order I gave you ?
I told you , sir , they were totally drunk , so puffed up with courage that they were getting angry at the air for blowing in their faces , and beating the ground for touching their feet , yet even when drunk , they kept their plan firmly in mind .
The stuff you had at the Centaur , sir .
It was a huge mistake to let old Gloucester live after we blinded him .
If I don't answer , perhaps you'll think I'm accepting the heavy responsibility you foolishly want to impose on me .
When did I ever do you any harm ?
Tell me .
Is it possible ?
Your master and his servant are here .
Good morning , gentlemen .
Anyway , what's up ?
Come , sisters , let's cheer him up and show him our talents .
Search high and low , in every acre of the fields , and bring him here for me to see him .
So be it .
If you'll take a simple man's advice , don't be here when it arrives .
What's your business ?
How are you and your master getting along ?
These men all have one intention , and it's directed against Caesar .
How the hell does he know our language ?
Good to see you , Master Antipholus .
But God forgive me for bragging .
Ah , leave it alone .
If we can do that , everything will be all right .
Tut , tut , my lord , we're not going to stand around chit-chatting .
There is a crab-apple here .
These things are beyond anything we've seen before , and I'm afraid .
This is that time .
He's eager to see your head .
I'll answer for everything .
Boys , how are you both doing ?
So Rosencrantz and Guildenstern are in for it .
Why did I ever have one ?
That was a humorous message .
Yes , I'll say it again , my lord .
In order to find a mother and a brother , I too have lost myself , unhappily .
You'll have to woo Bianca like the rest .
Now I'll stand up .
I'll never speak to you again .
Will you come with us ?
Why would Titania want to argue with her Oberon ?
Good to see you , Signior Hortensio .
I'll show you how kind I am .
The man who gives away his crust and his crumbs Will discover that he needs some crumbs back .
But first , I'll dump this fellow in his grave , then return to my love weeping with grief .
The question is , how would being king change him ?
Don't you realize the duke has also banished me , his daughter ?
Who's there ?
You look like a person who knows the business of war .
Please , my king , be quiet .
Music !
Please , sir ; crack jokes over lunch .
Will you come immediately ?
There isn't a single drop of sincerity in him that could be touched with love .
If a ship's leaving , come to the marketplace .
What about it ?
May the good Lord keep me safe from all women like her !
Oh , oh , Edmund , I don't like this monstrous business .
Now he's telling the story .
I was told that you were violent , proud , and sullen .
Excellent , good .
Well then , the beef without the mustard .
That's Enobarbus ?
Go to sleep , and I will wrap my arms around you .
He was happy here , listening to a song .
Have you come from Bellario's office in Padua ?
He thinks highly of me .
Oh wicked wall , through which I don't see any happiness !
Will he tell us what that pantomime meant ?
Be lenient , dearest !
You notorious whore !
I'm so amazed by this , I don't know what to say .
Are you laughing at what I say , as if I were a fool ?
I do not know that you are as good a man as myself .
Who will thank us now ?
Divide each man into a thousand , and there you will have an imaginary army .
Let's go , we'll obey you .
Yes , but I am insulting myself by thinking this way .
He's married .
Oh , go , leave me .
Servant monster" ?
Meanwhile , I'd be gratified if you'd live and eat your food .
You old traitor , repent all your sins .
Then heaven have mercy on me !
Call yourself your own sister , because I want you .
He has one ship bound for Tripoli , another heading for the Indies .
It's a long story , and tough to listen to .
Those who have done this deed are honorable .
I don't love Hermia ; I love Helena .
He said "Goodbye , madam , " and nothing else .
I wish you well .
Give me my robe , because I'm going .
Do you doubt I'll write ?
It can not be .
I have news from Rome , my good lord .
What if I'd said I saw him do something to hurt you ?
They made him drink the leftover wine usually given to the poor .
And although we're giving these honors to this man so that he shares some of the blame for what we're doing , he'll carry these honors like a jackass carries gold , groaning and sweating under the load , either led or pushed , as we direct him .
Ride out to the horsemen on that hill .
Yes , my good lord .
Don't let them know fear .
If he's nearby , I want an explanation .
Very well , my supreme lord , that's what I have to call you now .
Not yet." Well , the time has come .
Why are you yelling at me so angrily ?
What about Stanley ?
You teach me how I should act .
No , no , until it comes true we'll pretend it was just a dream we had .
Why not ?
Ready .
Are you hiding your forehead with a golden crown , when , if there was any justice in this world , it should be branded with the murders you committed , your slaughter of the prince who held that crown , and of my sons and my brothers ?
Do something about it , then .
I know him well by reputation .
If my doing what you told me to makes you happy , then be happy , because I did it .
You're a man ?
Cassio was wrong to hurt Montano , who was only trying to help him , but I'm sure the guy who ran away must have offended Cassio in some terrible way , and Cassio couldn't let it pass .
Why , who's so stupid that he can't see through this fraud ?
And Cassio's killed ?
You mean a devil !
I know that young men look forward to their rest .
Noble Brutus has mounted the platform .
What my lord said I was .
I only need to show your sword to Caesar and tell him about your death to get into his good favor .
If any legs here are Trinculo's , these are .
Farewell , sir .
No one .
I can stand well enough , and I can speak just fine .
Pardon us , dear father .
To our horses , you gallant princes .
I am not made of stone ; I am affected by all these kind pleas , though it goes against my conscience and my soul .
Cassius , stand firm .
Is there more news ?
All right then .
What time is it ?
She says all the right things , but the dumbest brothel-keeper would tell the same story .
He'll have to kill both of us , and indeed we're both men .
Then tomorrow at dinner ?
From this moment on I have a higher opinion of you than before .
I don't want anything more .
Haven't you made your other love , Demetrius , who kicked me with his foot not long ago , call me a goddess and a divine , rare , precious , heavenly creature ?
Please wear this ring .
Put him within the reach of my sword , and if he escapes , may heaven forgive him as well !
Can you tell me ?
And my king goes on : if your royal father does not sweeten the bitter insult you sent my king and grant all our demands , Henry's artillery will give you so resounding an answer that the very caves and vaulted cathedrals of France shall echo your mocking of him back in your face .
I know you have no choice .
Music feeds the melancholy moods of us lovers .
Antony , it's time to stop your wild hedonism .
The Danes , the Germans , and the Dutch , come on , drink , drink ! , are nothing compared to the English .
Now that you speak of paper , I remember a funny story of Hero's .
Please tell me seriously what you think of her .
Come on , niece , I'm sure you love him .
Tell me where you live .
In the end I grudgingly consented .
Whether your mouth is black or white , Do-dee , dee-dee da .
Don't go out today .
He gave Syria , Cilicia , and Phoenicia to Ptolemy .
And as you know , his connections , if he put them to good use , might be enough to hurt us all .
Even if you had your eyes , you still might not recognize me .
The sun is up and we're wasting the day !
I found her adjusting the crown on her dead mistress .
Stanley dreamed the boar beheaded him , and I laughed and refused to flee with him .
I think it would be very hard to arrange for them to have sex while you watched .
That's good advice .
I held the sword and he ran on it .
I rejoice in his good fortune .
Come on .
Oh , Luciana , did he tempt you like that ?
No , she's worse : she's the devil's mother , and she comes to us disguised as an easy wench .
There's my dagger Put away your dagger .
Do you know anyone who would kill someone for money ?
This means I've mistreated Edgar .
And the Prince and Claudio , who accused her , are innocent as well , because they were deceived by Don John .
What if your husband strays elsewhere ?
Let us in so we can tie him up tight and bring him home to recover .
And he deserves it , having been excellent before he had a reputation for it .
When your mind is at peace , your body is sensitive to the elements .
I'm sorry .
I think I'm getting delirious .
Besides , I have some business to take care of in town .
The handkerchief !
But in this way , grief and comfort appear together .
You can heat your iron up in here .
Get out of my sight ! , I guess if she doesn't love her father , then I'll only have peace when I'm dead. , Call the King of France .
Maybe some merchant at the marketplace invited him home for lunch .
Tell us , Othello .
All right , stop this .
See , now I have you .
Here , madam : Translate .
Your whole family will be ruined .
Both ?
Come here .
If everyone looked so lovely in their sorrow , then sorrow would be highly prized .
You'll pay for this if I ever see you face-to-face in the daylight .
Come on , I'll fight you .
The clock hasn't struck yet .
Fine , but you weren't harsh enough .
Those men you just mentioned will be beheaded today .
You're just playing around .
You , Roderigo !
What , the necklace ?
Yes , him , woman .
The king loves you very much .
I beg your pardon , sirs. , Please tell me your name , sir ?
Very near , my master .
Dear man , calm your rage .
Why do you look like a frightened goose ?
Nobody will hurt us .
That's right , you stupid thing .
It would be hard , almost impossible .
You're standing .
We have to be married properly .
So be it , Dolabella .
Yes , it's William , sir .
But you had bad blood in you , no matter how much you learned , and good people couldn't stand to be near you .
He wouldn't get drunk much , since there's no wine here .
You'll get some of what you want .
I hope to God I'm wrong about your chances .
Here comes his body , mourned by Mark Antony , who , though he had no part in the killing , will benefit from his death , receiving a share in the commonwealth , as you all will .
But where will we go ?
I hope to God it's something political , like you think , and not jealousy involving you .
Let's start .
Yes , ma'am .
Let me sit down .
be like the fountain that my children and all my descendants flow from , has rejected me !
God bless you .
That was one hit .
And even though you were brought up as a gentleman , you patiently tolerated more hardships than savages could withstand .
Why should men be more free than women ?
If I could beg others to change their minds , begging would convince me , too .
There isn't a nobler man than Antony in all of Rome .
If he'd written nice things , I'd swear yes right away .
Please just name a time , but don't wait more than three days .
Yes , my lord .
And no doubt he is , gracious madam .
What does it matter ?
And yet for all that , if she didn't hate him to death , she'd love him to death .
At dinner .
And I'm expecting his reproach .
You have bested many things , well don't try and best me .
Sir , he told me quite bluntly that he didn't feel like it .
I know that he'll be on our side .
When a great leader dies he doesn't die alone but , like a whirlpool , draws others with him .
What should I pay you ?
Just remember who you've got on board with you , good man .
I'll walk around and force the commoners off the streets .
Is there such a place ?
Oh , how silly we are !
I'll think over what you've said , I'll listen patiently to whatever else you have to say , and I'll find a good time for us to discuss further such weighty matters .
I hope he's not anywhere so disreputable that thugs like you can find him .
Our men have all broken ranks .
Your grace , the person who is going to deliver the prologue is ready .
I could drink hot blood and do such terrible deeds that people would tremble even in the daylight .
Halt !
I hope heaven protects him from the weather , because I lost sight of him on the stormy sea .
Why , what's the matter ?
Oh , liars can look so honest !
I hate it and want all good men's love .
Come on , put it away .
I could swear this is the real Vincentio .
Ladies , you're dropping bread from the heavens to starving people .
The gods forbid !
Choose your revenge .
I'm very sick , too .
As king , I can not risk the danger he represents as he grows crazier by the hour .
Aren't these woods less perilous than the court , with all its jealousies and intrigues ?
Some people kiss shadows .
In every one of the lords ' households I have a servant paid to spy for me .
Didn't you just say he was ?
Drown yourself ?
Ding , dong , bell .
I did kill her .
Come , this way to the rowboat .
Let's go to the temple first .
As long as I'm alive , I'll be here .
Let me finish my curse .
He will if he lives long enough to become a man .
Thoughts work so quickly that even now you can imagine him on Blackheath , where his lords suggest that he should carry his battle-scarred sword and helmet on a procession through the city .
Yours , if we're talking about I'm leaving .
Why , mistress , my master is as angry as a bull with horns .
Meet me at the palace as soon as possible .
I swear I have no idea why he stopped loving me .
Really , I'm afraid you are .
It might as well be the same with Caesar .
Caesar and he are better friends than ever .
So submit to my mercy or , like men who revel in their own destruction , challenge me to do my worst .
On the way , we came across my wife , her sister , and their gang of vile associates .
You'll be ashamed of this forever !
We'd find that he was a dangerous plotter .
What a fine sight !
I have a list of all the important men .
I have to do it , I have to do it .
There isn't any kindness in the snake .
Oh God , Benedick will plague him like a disease !
Before you make My lord , you could really help me out now .
Is that true , my lords of England ?
When they're endangered , I save them .
Claribel , his daughter .
Run , everyone , run !
I'll bet my life you gave some woman the ring !
Why didn't I just adopt a beggar's child left at my doorstep , whose shame and dishonor I could have denied , not being its true father ?
And to you , most noble Caesar .
Or ask you to leave the room ?
My belongings are on the ship already .
Now he won't give me either .
Please do .
It's my daughter !
But you'll see that the very thing that joins them will be the thing that separates them .
Why did you carry these daggers out of the room ?
These ones , then , will be assassinated .
He's out of his right mind .
Oh , let me speak !
He couldn't eat without me talking about it .
Did you call for me , your Worship ?
What is the tyrant Macbeth doing ?
I think someone's coming from Venice .
And its tears are wet .
Before I saw Lysander , Athens seemed like paradise to me .
For you , our swords have blunt edges , too dull to harm you , Mark Antony .
God bless your Grace !
This is the fool who lent out money without charging interest .
Three thousand ducats .
Now I'll believe that unicorns exist , and that there's a tree in Arabia where the phoenix lives .
True .
Foolish dogs , blindly running straight toward a Russian bear only to have their heads crushed like rotten apples .
Let fortune and victory be yours !
I hope Demetrius comes to love you as much as you love him !
Look , sir .
Thanks for that .
Bandage my wounds !
I'll do anything you ask .
Go get some water and wash this bloody evidence from your hands .
I have no doubt that you love me .
Man , they were asking for it .
You're acting stupid , Casca , and you lack the quick wits that a Roman should have , or else you don't use them .
Show them in .
No , someone has to give her away or the marriage isn't legal .
But Count Claudio can stay , for what I'm about to say concerns him .
To leave his wife , his children , his house , and his titles in a place so unsafe that he himself flees it !
Do you hear what I say , lady ?
Oh , cut my bodice-staps so that my pent-up heart can have some room to breathe , or I'll faint from this deadly news !
Oh , Brutus !
Look how politely it's pointing you to a place that's farther away .
Farewell , my lord .
Your friend , Artemidorus." I'll stand here until Caesar passes by , and I'll give him this as though it's a petition .
Make room for Antony , most noble Antony !
Madam , I'm a bit like you in that I can't tolerate a tone of disapproval .
Not now .
I don't think there's anywhere I'd rather die than in the king's company , as his cause is just and honorable .
Sir , that would be me and my partner .
If I'm not mistaken , that's Portia's voice .
Run and proclaim it in the streets .
We're off to eat and whoop it up at your father's house .
You'll just lie there like sleeping dogs and say nothing .
Indulge us further and supplement our performance with your own imaginings .
Kings and noblemen served him .
Here I am , Theseus .
Oh God , who is , by the way , the best comic of them all .
And harm is getting close !
What do you think will be the result of this storm ?
I swear I won't , sir .
Have mercy , Jesus ! , Wait , I was only dreaming .
If I weren't forbidden to tell you the secrets of
What , you're leaving it with Lysander ?
I beg your pardon , I thought it was me whom you were calling all those terrible names .
I don't know you .
The less they deserve , the more your generosity is worth .
Where's my son Edmund ?
And Trinculo's drunk .
God help you , foolish man .
James Tyrrel , and your most obedient subject .
Goodbye .
Is that what he says ?
Look for yourself , see the top of the cliff way up there ?
Don't you , Dromio ?
We charge you , in the Prince's name , to stop !
How horrible !
What do you mean by that ?
A man of great influence .
Three months from twelve months of the year .
I don't know .
I see you're all determined to gang up on me for a few laughs .
The court awards it and the law authorizes it .
Give him the goblet .
Be bold , and get ready .
Is this the Prince ?
Very well , thank you .
I heard the news , my lord .
Twelve years ago , Miranda , twelve years ago your father was the Duke of Milan , a powerful prince .
Please , don't be sad , and don't tell me how reluctant you are .
Your eyes are like stars , and your voice is more musical than a lark's song is to a shepherd in the springtime .
Have you heard this , Cassio ?
The sails were dyed purple , and they were perfumed so heavily that they made the air seem dizzy with love .
But sir , have you married my daughter without my consent ?
I'm good at everything that ordinary men can do .
Oh , it's horrible , horrible .
And so he fainted .
They're entirely welcome .
It does have a back like a weasel's .
Before your sentence has been completed ?
This is a good agreement .
So you've dared him to single combat .
Is this servant of yours a smart man ?
Good idea .
The two of them were separated during the storm .
Have you forgotten the torture I freed you from ?
I've told cowards to turn their backs on me and run .
Please , get some excellent music , because tomorrow we want to serenade Lady Hero at her bedroom window .
No .
When did I say all that ?
For God's sake , my lord , let's be sure to be part of the group that meets the prince .
I heard the owl scream and the crickets cry .
But I won't sleep till I get back .
And she screamed at me , right ?
But in this case of wooing , a child shall father his own father , if my wits don't fail me .
I wish I were as big and strong as you .
There's a nice reason why the constellation Pleiades has only seven stars in it .
You told me that you don't salute at the court but kiss hands .
What miracle will he work next ?
Knock .
I can't speak anymore .
All right , then .
It's you we were laughing at .
I don't even know you .
And so , good morning to all of you .
We'll talk more about this later. , Egeus , I'm overriding your wishes .
Yes , and he's been carried off the field .
Don't make me wait for dinner even a moment .
Do that .
I am the duke who loved your father .
Come here , ma'am .
All traitors protest like this .
Therefore my sadness is without limit .
Yes .
Come on .
Bad friends were .
No !
My husband is often like this , and he has been since he was a child .
Be patient with him , Brutus .
And brief , good mother , I'm in a hurry .
I repeat , he's in love .
It never ceases to amaze me the way people ignore the correct , traditional principles and rules of war .
Will it never be morning ?
What would the King of Naples do if he heard you say that ?
And when will you see him again ?
I can't believe that .
He has both my power and my influence over Octavia .
Believe me , King of Illusions , I made a mistake .
Take me by the hand and say , "Harry of England , I am yours." No sooner shall I hear that word than I will tell you straight out , "England is yours , Ireland is yours , France is yours , and Harry Plantagenet
The armies have merely changed places , Titinius , because Octavius has been overthrown by noble Brutus's forces at the very moment that Antony overthrew Cassius's legions .
Who are all these people ?
Go to my room and put on something of mine .
Go on , Caesar .
I'd rather be wooed by a snail .
Until then , think about the well-being of Rome .
It's now late at night , and actions must accommodate bodily needs , which we'll satisfy with only a short rest .
True , noble prince .
And here he comes , puffing himself up like a turkey .
But I must go there , against my will : servants must fulfill their masters ' wishes .
Yes , yes .
Oh , don't ask me why I "need" them !
His eyes used to glow with pride when he reviewed his troops .
It's the wind .
Don't take Helena's side .
Why do you care that he loves Hermia ?
I swear , , each actor arrived on his ass .
Go look and then do the talking yourselves .
Who can tell me who I am ?
That's good .
He didn't know how to stop it .
Yes , with Cassio .
That blind head of yours was created to make me rich .
If he's angry , there must be something seriously wrong .
The dust from your attending troops should have risen to heaven .
If he's caught , he'll never make trouble for anyone again .
Yes .
I'm beginning to understand what you want me to do .
I've heard many of the noblest Romans , next to immortal Caesar , speaking of you , complaining of the tyranny of today's government , and wishing that your eyes were working better .
And that's how I'll turn her good intentions into a big trap to snag them all .
Soon we will toast around the table .
I don't know what to say .
That's Claudio .
Bring us the letters .
Don't talk to me .
I won't say anything negative about what he might be .
My lord !
Ate at home ?
And would I have ever done that to you ?
Let's go .
He was like that time of year halfway between the extremes of hot and cold : he was neither sad nor happy .
Then Caesar and he will always be united .
I'm crying at how unworthy I am to give you what I want to give you and to take what I'm dying to have .
But what did you want ?
My God , it's morning .
The moment they planned to act is almost here .
I don't know what you mean , madam .
I'll give you letters of introduction to some friends of mine who will help you .
Fifteen years !
Not young enough to fall in love with a woman because she sings well , but not old enough to dote on a woman for any reason .
Well , onward , then .
He was so slick in covering over his plans that if it hadn't been for his love affair with Shore's wife , I would never have suspected him .
The best way to be happy is to be in between .
As long as that ?
He doesn't have children .
I wouldn't allow your enemies to say that , and I won't believe it from you .
Welcome , my good friends .
Is this the family tomb of Leonato ?
Cheer yourself .
Wait !
I'm telling you , it was Carthage .
What do you think , madam ?
Oh , my son , my son !
Lead us , monster ; we'll follow .
What we have to worry about is a full-scale invasion from Scotland , always an unreliable neighbor .
They're saying I'd be an animal without a heart if I stayed home today out of fear .
But there are many herbs that will help him rest and take his mind off his anguish for a while .
Come , Vaughan .
You know , if you were anyone other than Brutus , that speech would be your last .
You can push my buttons , but you can't play me for a fool .
Why , sir , you know this is your wedding day .
Now , on my life , the young child must be headed to the Tower to greet the young princes , whom she adores .
How is lieutenant Cassio ?
Harry le Roy .
That's when you gave them the spanking paddle and pulled your pants down , Please , uncle , hire a teacher who can teach your fool to lie .
He's afraid to come in .
Rob them of the ability to count before the numbers against them overwhelm their courage .
Who's winning ?
They fled toward Peloponnesus .
I should really leave right away .
Order supplies for your trip and choose your traveling companions .
My name is Proculeius .
I just meant that you should use some holy thistle .
You speak absolutely correctly , sir .
Do you have the flower ?
Watch Titinius and tell me what you see in the field .
Portia , are you really gone ?
The more she
But I'm ashamed to kiss , sir .
This is just another one of the hallucinations you always get when you're afraid .
But tell us , did you hear anything about Antonio's loss at sea ?
Come on , Balthasar , let's hear that song again .
No .
A man , like you .
You're smart , though , and if you were sick , you'd take what you needed to get better .
Oh , honey !
Promise me you'll let me live , and I'll confess the truth .
Boy !
These sweet thoughts relieve me and refresh me , especially when I'm slaving away busily .
Yes , I see them coming .
I'm more like an ancient Roman than a corrupt modern Dane .
Go escort the lords of France and Burgundy , Gloucester .
God be with you and keep you , and may he heal your head .
So get down on your knees and beg mercy from the duke .
Lighten up .
No , and she swears she never will .
The more I love him , the more he hates me .
If I'd been a common laborer and hadn't taken him up on his offer , to hell with me .
What news do you bring ?
What , in our own house ?
What do you mean , the seventh cause ?
You'll remain a prisoner until we bring your crimes to the Venetian government. , Okay , take him away .
But wait a moment .
Listen , Hortensio .
Drowning is for cats or blind puppies , don't drown yourself !
Yes , I was , but I don't want an answer from you .
If you knew the reason , you'd understand and would urge me to go rather than stay .
What handkerchief ?
What , he never made you laugh ?
Anyway , even if he had the money now , the Jew probably wouldn't take it .
There's a nicer piece of work right here .
Have all his business ventures failed ?
Well , we almost fought and then realized that we had reached the seventh cause .
Hello , sir .
Everyone's there except Metellus Cimber , and he's gone to look for you at your house .
You're a man with a good reputation .
Is that the latest we can do it ?
He would just see me for what I am , a person amazed to hear you talking about Naples .
And your lies caused this murder .
Well , it seems to me that she is too short to be praised highly , too dark to be praised fairly , and too small to be praised greatly .
Right this instant , I'm going to Caesar's funeral .
She's talking .
Your Honor's is unhealthy talk .
No .
Oh , here she comes .
I'll tell you as soon as I know , Richard , because at this point I have no idea .
You're thought to be the most
Are we all ready ?
Well , not in deed , madam , since I can't do anything unchaste .
Oh , Mother Nature , why did you create lions ?
What's the matter ?
Adieu , good Mr. Depression .
It is well done , and appropriate for a princess who has descended from so many royal kings .
What do you think ?
If she can't find out what his secret is , then send him off to England or wherever you think best .
This is to feel the news , not hear it .
Where am I going ?
I could go around the world in forty minutes .
I was telling you he used witchcraft to take this island .
I'll head to France soon .
He knows that you didn't embrace Antony because you loved him , but because you feared him .
Oh , please let me .
We're three of them .
Play the kind of music that puts people to sleep .
Not so fast .
The clock struck three .
You're on your deathbed .
Don't get up yet .
Sure , to a cheap host and an even cheaper guest .
And you , sweet Hero ?
Tell her .
When we love our job we get up early and go to it joyfully .
Is there anything inaccurate in that ?
The Duke and any of my fellow senators will take this wrong as seriously as if it were their own .
Dear Bassanio , my ships have all been wrecked .
It's true , this so-called "god" , he shook .
For my part , I'm sorry this battle turned into a drinking match .
I hate to say it , but it's almost two and we won't get there before suppertime .
But here comes a scoundrel who says he saw me at the marketplace and that I beat on him , told him I'd given him a thousand marks in gold , and then lied about my wife and my house .
Yes , my lord , quite well .
They'll consider you and Jessica masters of this house in place of Lord Bassanio and myself .
Yes , but they don't see anything .
Do you even get what I'm saying ?
Enough to buy everything you have declared .
Good-bye .
He who chooses me must give and risk all he has." Must give everything , for what ?
You know tomorrow is her wedding day .
Procreation is a good thing , but if your daughter gets pregnant , look out , friend .
My deep trust in him made him deeply untrustworthy , arousing in him a treachery as big as my trust was , my trust which had no limit , an infinite confidence .
Then heaven have mercy on me .
Good-bye , great commander .
Are you Tyrrel ?
And has my armor been put in my tent ?
Benedick and Beatrice have been waging a war of wits between themselves .
What , all my children and their mother dead in one fell swoop ?
Quiet , I say .
This just may cheer me up .
But let it rain ; I'll survive .
I'm reluctant to tell you what I wish you knew .
It's a good shilling , I promise you .
What are you doing here alone ?
May the evil one take me if I meant it like that !
Wake up my whole household !
And I've been avoiding him all day .
The two of us will guard you while you sleep , my lord , and keep you safe .
Who ?
Calm down .
They're just flattering me .
Please Margaret , help me write this poem for Beatrice .
I have no personal reason to strike at him , only the best interest of the people .
Why are you whispering ?
Don't swear by the future , because you've ruined it before it has even arrived .
Now , my dear friend , what lucky wind blows you in from Verona ?
Has he come home yet ?
Unfaithful ?
Draw your sword and give me enough blows to kill me .
My lord , I won't miss it .
Treason !
He's calling us back .
And that's how my brother robbed me of my life , my crown , and my queen all at once .
Therefore , tremble with fear and leave .
I saw Mark Antony offer him a crown , though it wasn't a real crown , just a small circlet , and , as I told you , he refused it once , though in my opinion he would've liked to have it .
And here I am , with that piece .
Take me to the edge of it , and I'll reward all your troubles with something valuable .
I just want everything to be all right between you .
I'm never in the mood to laugh when I hear sweet music .
And that's what you want me to do !
Did you hear that ?
What's the "seventh cause" ?
That's how you'll talk about me when you're in this mood .
Then I hope night shadows your day , and death takes your life !
I'm going now .
Thanks , you brave men who defend this island and respect Othello .
Let's go gather our jewels and money .
Did you leave on good terms ?
No .
Now , your gown ?
It would've been better for you not to have been born at all than to displease me as you did .
Now there can only be the promise .
That's the way great men ought to endure great losses .
Yes , I do , sir .
Listen , I hear them .
If you interrupt this monster with one more word , I'll beat you like a piece of salted fish .
I'd rather have a jester to make me happy than experience to make me sad , and to travel for all that trouble , no less !
From now on , goodness in women , not superficial beauty , will win my heart .
But for whose sake did I do that sick deed ?
That's exactly what they said .
Don't you have any manners , you savage ?
Come on , we have to follow the leaders of the dance .
I think a story like that would win my own daughter over .
Do you have it with you ?
If you say one more word , I'll punish you , maybe even hate you .
Ouch , what a comeback !
They all fell asleep together , as if they'd planned it .
Go on , wear your boots out !
We still have hope .
Go as fast as you can .
But this whole thing is strange .
All these aging faculties tell me , and I can not be wrong , that you are my son , Antipholus .
When was there ever an age , since the beginning of time , that didn't feature more than one famous man ?
It's obvious to everyone that you've tricked her , drugged her , or kidnapped her .
Gracious Queen , even Herod of Judea wouldn't dare look at you unless you were in a good mood .
The poor people died .
No one may be bolder than my Lord Hastings .
According to an agreement , I should wear it myself .
As you wish , sir .
You'd better bring the messenger safely through the lines so he can return .
So good-bye for now .
Your wife and children were savagely slaughtered .
What can I do for you , madam ?
No , advancement to the dignity and height of honor , to a high , imperial kind of glory .
Let it be who it is .
What's going on ?
Do you lie still ?
Buckingham , I need to have a word with you .
Then you are damned .
Maybe ?
Where's Antony ?
My lord , when I arrived at their home I gave them your letter .
Yes , and that's surprising , because lovers are usually early .
Is that possible ?
I've made a risky investment .
It's a lucky sign , isn't it ?
Get to it , be lustful , sleep around , I need soldiers for my army .
I see you're all eaten up with emotion .
Shut up , fool .
But you're keeping a hundred knights here who are so disorderly , vulgar , and obnoxious that our noble court is starting to look like a noisy cheap hotel .
I'll keep my promise just as if you really were Rosalind .
Ensign , what's he doing in there ?
If you keep on the way you've been going , you'll kill yourself .
Who , him ?
But how ?
But I promise it can be cured with some guidance .
Unless I've mistaken his battle flags , which I'm sure I haven't , his regiment lies at least half a mile south of the king's mighty army .
What is the name of the castle that stands over there ?
I was not angry since I came to France until this instant .
He only married out of political necessity .
If you say that , you bastard , you'll kill your Queen .
I'm sorry about what happened , but I'm sure everything will turn out all right .
God , help us not be jealous !
But you won't take his flesh if he can't pay .
Poor poisonous fool , be angry and bite .
I have to admit that when I saw his suicide during rehearsal , I had tears in my eyes , but they were tears of laughter .
And the men resemble their English hounds in their loud , showy ferocity , too , leaving their brains behind with their wives .
But as it stands , I wish I could believe it wasn't .
I swear by this hand that I love you .
We'll meet again at nine in the morning .
Away with the doddering fool !
Let me say "amen" quickly , before the devil comes in and stops my prayer , because here comes the devil , disguised as a Jew .
Just as if they were perfectly loyal and faithful .
You stole it from her ?
You may change your mind later .
I'm glad about that .
A person can only pay with their life once , and she has paid in full .
It's the tragedy of our times that lunatics must lead the blind .
If its juice is put on someone's eyelids while they're asleep , that person will fall in love with the next living creature he or she sees .
One of them contains my picture .
It is not the custom for the maids in France to kiss before they are married , is that what she says ?
Yes .
You couldn't find a third like these two unless the devil himself turned into a Jew .
That's all there is to say .
Oh , dear !
Husbands need to know that their wives are human beings too .
Innocent sweethearts , you have no idea who's responsible for your father's death .
We used to sit together and sew one flower with our two needles , sewing it on one piece of cloth , sitting on the same cushion , singing one song in the same key , as if our hands , our sides , our voices and our minds were stuck together .
Enough , cousin .
Because she's been chosen by Signior Hortensio .
She hangs around me all the time .
He is worth more mourning than that , and I will mourn for him .
Well , to wear out their shoes and get myself more work .
Will you , Strato ?
Ha , ha !
I remember when I was in love , I broke my sword on a stone , and told him to take that for coming at night to see Jane Smile .
My master's calling me .
Get off the field , my lord .
I know they do , and I certainly deserve it .
Where are you all off to ?
This guy is exactly the kind of person your sister warned us about. , Come on , bring in the stocks , now !
When you avoid one trap , you fall into another .
Don't hurt me , please .
Sirs , take up the corpse .
Here , sir !
In Spain , Caesar had a fever , and it made him shake .
A very nasty meaning .
If I let him go , I'll have to pay his bail fees myself .
You think so ?
Carry him gently to bed , and every man be ready at his post when he awakes .
I remember him well , and my memory tells me that he deserves your praise .
I'll help out , if only because he speaks the same language as me .
Look , he's approaching Caesar .
Everything is a sick joke .
How dare you talk about kindness or shame .
Answer all of us , now .
It was worse than being a captive in chains .
A man who's robbed , but doesn't miss what's stolen , isn't robbed at all .
No , because my manly heart is grieving .
Do you think you've won ?
I have more reason to be distressed .
If you do , please give it to me , because I need to start learning the lines .
An important droplet is hanging from the corner of the moon .
What would that be ?
The humiliation is all mine .
I saw her face as she walked with her brother and Mark Antony .
If either of you were a prince's son , and you were imprisoned as I am now , and two murderers like yourselves came to you , wouldn't you beg for your life ?
And , being men , the contents of Caesar's will would enrage you .
Besides , according to the French historians , King Pepin , who deposed Childeric , based his own claim to the crown of France on his descent from Blithild , the daughter of King Clothair .
Why do I have to do that ?
I'll fight brutally .
I'll vouch for Grumio .
Definitely not .
Oh , that's nonsense !
You there , sir , come here please .
I just beg death to wait awhile , until I place the last of our many thousands of kisses on your lips .
That's the one .
No , I found it and gave it to my husband .
Yes , sir .
Can you buy them with money ?
Yes , do that .
It's a wonder you didn't lose your life and your mind all at once. , He's waking up .
Really ?
Everyone thought it would pass then , and it probably would have had it not been for the great civil unrest and uncertainty of the time , which required the matter to be put off .
He sent me word that , whether I liked it or not , he liked it fine .
She'll have to have it .
And then he'll , he'll , wait , what was I about to say ?
But did you tell him she cheated on him ?
If they'd put you in the stocks for asking that question , you would've deserved it .
The more fool you for betting on my loyalty .
They're all ready to eat dinner .
Honestly , no .
There's nothing to get upset about .
Here , catch this box .
His youngest daughter , the beautiful Bianca , is the jewel of my life , and he keeps her hidden away from me and other rivals for her hand .
Listening to their frightened voices , I couldn't reply "Amen" when they said "God bless us ! " Don't think about it so much .
You think my uncle was lying , grandmother ?
Oh Nerissa , my poor little body is tired of this great big world .
Sir , let's get to the point .
Can we go ?
I hope you're not drowned .
Then I heard the trumpets blow twice , and left him there in a trance .
While the armed hand fights in foreign lands , the wise head defends itself at home .
Othello's wife has a lot of influence now .
If I'm going to sing along with you , I need to know what key you're singing in .
There is a way , ma'am .
I'm telling you , you jerk priest , my sister will be an angel in heaven while you're howling in hell .
My father's dead , and his fortune is mine now .
Do you hear that , men ?
And you , good farmers , whose limbs were made in England , show us here the vigor of your upbringing .
Oh , what a sinful thought !
Can I have a word with you ?
Jesus , let's kill him !
Oh , no , that was my lady's voice .
Good countrymen , let me leave alone .
My king , they haven't come back yet .
Herald , spare yourself .
Where is my lord , the duke of Gloucester ?
I'll give you a greater gift than that , nephew .
Here's mine .
Where am I ?
Farewell .
Who are you ?
What should we say , my lord ?
This island belongs to me because Sycorax , my mother , left it to me .
I want to hear more about this .
I wish you and your scarred self had convinced me to wage our last battle on land .
No , please , I beg your Majesty .
And will you have me ?
I can justify that better than you can justify sleeping with Portia's African servant .
If Echo were as fast , he would be worth a dozen like Belman .
Goodbye .
Well , then , I hope he chokes on it !
Friends , go your separate ways .
I'll do it , sir .
I am willing to fight you if I must .
Welcome , my lord .
Here's some money for you .
Yes , we are .
Did you see anything ?
The sun will never be seen by such royal eyes again .
They only like things as bad as themselves .
What music should we play then ?
Did God make him ?
He'll just turn it into a joke and torment the poor woman even more .
Let Merriman catch his breath , the poor dog's foaming at the mouth .
But he kept chattering so foolishly , talking about you in such insulting and despicable terms , that it was hard for me to restrain myself .
I'll give you such reasons for killing him that you'll feel obliged to snuff him out .
The one who makes her queen , of course .
Then take this man into your service , Octavius , for he did the final service to my master .
You might as well try to stab the air with your sword .
Why should I be afraid of your judgment when I haven't done anything wrong ?
If anyone here knows a better way to tame a shrew , speak up , please .
Winter garments need to be filled with something , And so does skinny Rosalind .
I hope God keeps that monster from growing in Othello's mind !
Don't you see my baby suckling at my breast so that its nurse will fall asleep ?
I beg you to pardon me .
May God thank you for it .
I got this purse full of money from you , and my Dromio brought it to me .
The queen your mother is upset , and sent me to see you .
Good-bye , my lord .
The whole world wants her .
Please , go away .
That's her father and his friends , who've been roused out of bed .
Oh Dardanius !
Your mother's been poisoned .
The next bit of good news is that our ship , which we gave up for ruined only three hours ago , is as well-outfitted and seaworthy as it was when we first set sail .
But by the grace of God , she's mine .
Hurry , go !
Let any man perish who isn't ready now !
Caesar is in a sober mood .
I will , Caesar .
Did you accompany Caesar home ?
What will be my evidence ?
It was a lovely wedding , and we're doing really well on our trip home .
Your fortunes are the same .
That's just what he said in the letter .
And does this prospect of good fortune make you happy ?
I have quarreled four times , and almost got in a fight .
Does that necessarily mean you should love his son ?
Dreams are a sign of ambition , since ambition is nothing more than the shadow of a dream .
Curly golden hair moves so nicely in the wind and makes a woman beautiful .
I'm afraid something dangerous is coming toward you .
Oh , noble Caesar !
Are you going riding this afternoon ?
Don't worry , I won't .
Now , tell me , which of my bad qualities did you fall in love with first ?
I have drawn my sword .
I should be ridiculed if I were offended so easily , and laughed at even more for speaking of you disrespectfully , when I had no reason to speak of you at all .
Don't ask me to talk about it .
Right in the middle of the fight , just when the battle could have gone either way , actually we had a slight advantage , that immoral Egyptian nag , May she die of leprosy ! , suddenly became frightened , and turned her ships around and fled .
Is Antonio here ?
No , really , I don't .
Madam , he's well .
But for the whole world ?
Are you on duty again tonight ?
Where is my lovely bride ?
By God , it does look like a camel .
Hello , everyone !
Did it stay a long time ?
My only sin was loving you too much .
You have , my lord .
Who's been with her ?
I'll give you more instructions later .
No , and I didn't hear anything either , or suspect anything at all .
In a fit of rage she locked you up in a hollow pine tree , with the help of her powerful assistants , and left you there for twelve years .
And what an excellent piece of work it is , too , madam lady !
Lead those away who will follow you , and we'll explain publicly the reasons for Caesar's death .
Heaven knows what he's going to do with it .
Poor man !
We'll be your witnesses .
I'll carry prayer books in my pocket and look sweet , even more .
A fortunate coincidence , more fortunate for your son .
He won't fight with me , Domitius ?
Well done !
If Well , I'll just forget the difficulties of my situation , in order to focus on the happiness of yours .
Have a good night !
Later , in a better world than this , I'd love to get to know you .
If there's any way I can spoil his life , I'll be overjoyed .
I'm here , I've been destroyed by villains !
Yes , he said something in Greek .
Signior Baptista , I'm glad to see you. , Sir , this is the gentleman I told you of .
My heart is ten times lighter than my looks .
Now please go .
Call Claudio and some of my other men .
Did you fall ?
With God's help .
Here comes my lord .
I'll be able to see better from that pine tree over there .
Fast !
And you're not to utter a syllable of Tranio's name .
Yes , even if I had whole kingdoms to give along with her .
But tell me , how is your cousin ?
He said , "Remember me." I swore I would .
Please let her speak .
Yes , my good lord .
In that case , there's reason to hope a man's memory may outlive him by six months .
Stillness and nighttime are perfect for beautiful music .
Quiet !
She has betrayed me and shall die .
If that's true , it makes up for all the sorrows I've ever known .
Get lost , will you ?
Octavia weeps at the thought of leaving Rome .
I'll let you know right away how it's going .
Say that I hope he never has cause to look for a new master .
But those political considerations might last such a long time that the general will forget my love and service , especially if I'm gone and someone else has my job .
Lord , " he calls you ?
I swear that gown's for me .
I can put him in the right mood , and I'll bring him to the Capitol .
Speak up and tell me !
I'm glad to see your highness .
From my house , if I had a house , " "The sixth of July .
Take it off and throw it on the ground .
But who is that ?
Welcome to Cyprus .
Thieves !
Even the goddess of patience couldn't look at this and be patient , it's too horrifying !
I know you well .
Who are you talking about ?
He is in heaven , where you will never go .
Even innocents can not always escape disaster .
Who can blame him for acting crazy , when inside he condemns himself for everything he's done ?
God be with all of you , princes .
He had a thousand noses and twisted horns , like wave crests in a storm at sea .
You do their work for them and give them good luck .
You're talking in such a crazy way , sir .
Am I a married man or a bachelor ?
That's why I'm worried about you .
Hound or spaniel , bitch or dog , Whether your tail is short or curly , Tom will make you cry and wail .
You are welcome for his sake .
Is something about to happen that warrants working this night and day ?
Good-bye .
Along the way , I'll find an opportunity to separate him from the queen's proud relatives , as step one in the plan we've discussed .
Mutton ?
But he isn't here now .
Let him thank me , who helped him get there .
But people often screw things up trying to make them better .
You're alive .
O Harry's wife , do not triumph in my sorrow !
I won't trouble you yet with questions about your situation. , Some music , please , and , good friend , sing .
You seem all right now .
What news do you have ?
O , this evil wind that spreads nothing but misery .
And buried , noble Tyrrel ?
Thank God , thank God !
See , ladies , how they scorn me now .
Nothing .
But stay calm , and don't get carried away by rage , or I'll think you're not a man .
Didn't I buckle this well ?
Lord , it's glancing every which way !
Oh , excellent !
Put out the light of the candle , and then put out the light of her heart .
Go announce that he will be executed , and tell Macbeth that Cawdor's titles will be given to him .
So , please , my lord , don't assume that I'm treacherous just because I'm poor , with no titles to my name .
Wait until I read the letter .
Wherever he goes , he inspires compassion and people turn against us .
I sneeze on your manhood .
In that case , he's more obliged to you than I am .
The night's too rough for humans to bear .
Come on now , wine is good for you , if you know how to use it .
Go play with yourself .
He was very upset that Fortinbras had taken advantage of his being old and sick to deceive him , and he ordered Fortinbras's arrest .
I know you know something about how excellent Laertes is ,
Therefore you must run , noble Cassius .
Let's go !
Get ready , my lord .
Farewell , and thanks .
Yes , my lord .
Good idea .
I , fight against you , Antony ?
I mean , is the jay more precious than the lark because his feather is more beautiful ?
He won't catch a wink of sleep , either at night or during the day .
What's that trumpet ?
He can act as brave as he wants , but I believe on a cold night like this he wishes he were neck-deep in the Thames , and I wish he were , too , and I with him , whatever the danger , so long as we were far away from here .
No offense taken .
Just listen carefully while I tell you the amazing thing I saw , with these gentlemen as witnesses .
Look , love , see how devoted I am ?
I'll let you know my answer shortly .
How do you mean ?
Ratcliffe !
How does she claim to own you ?
He is a gentleman of a good family , and for his ransom , he will give you two hundred crowns .
Most noble sir , stand up .
Do you know him ?
And then ?
And is it healthy to walk uncovered and breathe in the dampness of the morning ?
The It's too bad there's more of the Moor than there ought to be .
The business you began here needs you as well , especially the business with Cleopatra , which only you can attend to .
As far as I'm concerned , what's past is done .
God bless you for being here .
Stop , for God's sake !
Before the bat flies through the castle , and before the dung beetle makes his little humming noise to tell us it's nighttime , a dreadful deed will be done .
I meant they had to give her credit .
That will please God , who has him now .
I'm sticking to the contract .
Who here is so vile that he doesn't love his country ?
Ranting and raving to my own shadow !
I promise I will .
I think you've been frowning too much recently .
You stupid cop , stop your violence !
Here's more news .
I swear on my life that I'm speaking the truth .
Where is the villain , Edmund ?
If I could colonize this island , my lord , He'd cultivate weeds on it .
I remember kissing her washing stick and the cow's udders that her pretty , chapped hands had milked .
You men are rank beginners !
Rosalind , I have to leave you for two hours .
Me neither .
He was my friend , he was faithful and just to me .
Give me your hand , Kate .
He's not wise enough to be brave .
Yes indeed .
I'm just saying that if you're good and beautiful , your goodness should have nothing to do with your beauty .
It takes a good priest to practice what he preaches .
Good luck , sir .
Did you have to give them everything ?
My lord , he refuses to come .
I will , sir .
That's definitely true , my lord .
I'll bandage up these wounds and swear I got them in the French wars .
Night is approaching .
Why are you going crazy over these trashy clothes ?
You've described a warm friend who's cooling off .
One of our ships has reported that it saw most of their fleet shipwrecked .
She will purchase that peace with an everlasting war .
But I will tell you that I seduced Margaret , the Lady Hero's waiting woman , tonight .
Don't pardon that .
Have some patience , please .
In two months , a month before this loan is due , I expect to earn more than three times that much from my investments .
Oh , the poor man !
That's him .
You should know I've earned a thousand gold pieces from Don John .
What , are you moaning on about your toothache ?
It's too bad some mutual friend of theirs doesn't introduce them .
After you , sir .
Now I am no more than a woman , ruled by the same lowly passion as the maid who milks and does the humblest chores .
Quiet !
Duke , the abbess has wronged me and I seek justice .
Who's sounding that alarm ?
From what , in God's name ?
Who is leading his men ?
Sometimes the love my subjects bring me is inconvenient , but I still accept it as love .
Yes , heavily .
That's all he asks for himself .
With all my heart .
The forests , the skies , the mountains , everything around us seemed to echo the barks of the hounds .
I will not be faced or bested .
Yes , if the devil tempts you to do good .
My happiness and yours lie in her .
Yet you killed my children .
I've got the whole barrel , man .
You'd give the moon a shove if it got stuck five weeks in its orbit .
The things she has shamelessly hurled on me are beyond imagination .
Six pence a day would've been forced on him .
It's strange , strange .
And here's my mistress , Titania .
We're in .
Oh , Cassius , if you could only convince Brutus to join us , Don't worry .
Whew !
Invite all my sad captains .
Well , that turned out well in the end .
Bring her out , brother .
If your love was anything like mine , and I'm sure that no man has loved as I love now , exactly how many ridiculous actions did your fantasizing lead you to ?
I hereby declare we will have no more marriage .
Dear friends , let's go to bed .
Stay here , Titinius .
The wind that scatters young men throughout the world , encouraging them to seek their fortunes some place other than home , where there's little to be found in the way of experience .
Yes , sir .
Where that "sweetheart" said I was her husband !
He says she has no equal .
What do you say ?
It's hell in our house , and you helped cheer it up , like a funny devil .
Get out of here .
That's true , they are .
Early in the morning I'll go visit Desdemona and plead my case .
Besides , he brings his fate with him .
There was a time when I would have been terrified by a shriek in the night , and the hair on my skin would have stood up when I heard a ghost story .
I can .
Don't talk about Helena .
Well , good luck to them tonight in bed !
But here are other matters to be dealt with .
No , if you're ever late like this again , I'll refuse to see you .
My lord , that dirty clown whom you laughed at so often is also missing .
Yes , my lord .
I've said what I have to say .
It's strange that Regan and her husband left their house without sending back my messenger .
I won't be satisfied until I get even with him , wife for wife .
Now I am sure that eyes can't hurt a person .
Moreover , out of mercy , the Constable urges you to remind your men to make their peace with God and repent , so that their souls may depart sweetly and peacefully from these fields where , poor wretches , their bodies will likely fall and fester .
To , to , to , To murder me ?
If luck deserts us today , it's because we defy it .
No , my lord , your polite words are not to the point .
This one ?
There are things in this comedy of Pyramus and Thisbe that will never work .
Lucentio !
I'd rather lie in the Nile mud with flies laying their eggs in me , making me disgusting .
Gower is a good captain , and is well versed and well read in the wars .
Am I that name , Iago ?
We'll get married at some point , Audrey .
Remember that Hamlet is young and has a lot more freedom to fool around than you do .
What should I say to her ?
I even knew the tailor who made the disguise she wore when she ran off .
Doesn't everyone want a wife like that ?
What , an argument already ?
Stanley , pay attention to your wife's doings .
What would you like ?
Early in the morning we'll both rush to Belmont .
Where is your army , then , to beat him back ?
Snip and snip and cut and slash , it's got more holes than a sieve !
Well , until that time , don't come near me .
Please , my friend , give me all the news , both good and bad , at the same time .
Donalbain .
Your threats don't scare me , Cassius , because I'm so secure in my honesty and integrity that they pass me by like a weak breeze .
My darling Othello !
If I didn't have a good reason to do this , damn me to the very bottom of hell .
Certainly .
What is this passion that ties up my tongue ?
I don't think you would .
God have mercy , Grumio !
If my eyes don't deceive me , you are my daughter .
Murder and treason !
You are what's left of the noblest man that ever lived .
Think about it .
I know the king and queen sent for you .
I'll marry the earl of Warwick's youngest daughter , Lady Anne .
That pretty boy , Claudio ?
You corrupt judge , why did you let her escape ?
I'll return the favor .
But as of right this second all these things are yours .
Come , let's go .
Tell Antony that Brutus has been taken .
No , madam , no .
I'm wounded .
That's how I always do it , getting money from fools .
Yes , and that's a serious failing .
Yes , boy .
I'll make him tell me the whole story again , where , how often , how long ago , and when he plans to sleep with your wife in the future .
Why , what is there to do before I get there ?
Do you dare kill a friend of mine ?
Now I'll get Cassio to do something in front of all these drunkards that will offend everyone on the island .
Oh , she's so witty and creative !
Leave me .
He's an unremarkable man , fit only to be sent on errands .
Where have you been , my bravery ?
But his investments are uncertain right now .
I served Mark Antony , who was the commander most worthy of my services .
Nobody's coming ?
We can't all be masters , and not all masters should be followed .
This strong poison's overpowering me .
Watch out !
What proof is there ?
What's that paper you were reading ?
Lead the way , sir .
You're going to make me jealous , Launcelot , if you keep taking my wife into dark corners like this !
You knew , no one knew , no one knew as well as you did , about my daughter's plans to run away .
Agrippa , go start the battle .
The war's over and the Turks are drowned .
You can't have anything but the penalty , to be taken at your peril , Jew .
And I see a lot of Orlando here .
Your death and destiny advise your followers to escape .
I wish she'd never let you come .
It looks better in a king than his own crown looks on him .
It's a bet .
And I'll go to bed at noon .
Tell us about this wrestling .
What soldiers , fool ?
Even if she lives till the end of the world , she'd keep burning an additional week .
Here .
Get ready for the third hit , Laertes .
Can't he pay back the money ?
His running away has everything to do with fear and nothing to do with love .
No , not too upset .
Madam , you've given me life and given me a living too .
I am dying ! , My lord , you still have one eye left to see Cornwall punished .
If we let crimes like this happen , slaves and heathens will be our rulers .
Oh no , not if you say it right .
I swear on my life , which I take pretty seriously , even if I am a magician .
Endless greed and lust in a man's nature is a kind of tyranny .
Our business now is mourning and grief .
There's no face more sincere than one washed in tears .
Yes , they are .
What's the matter ?
The sight made me so sick I couldn't watch any more .
It has come again .
I will do more , though nothing I can do is any good since this remorse comes after the crime , asking for pardon .
Tell me , friend .
But has Catesby gone ?
Well , sir , go inside .
Talk to the ambassadors who've just come back : ask them how majestically he responded to their message , how well supplied he was with good advisors , how restrained in expressing his displeasure , and , moreover , how terrifyingly firm he was in his resolve .
Nothing ?
Go walk the path that you will never return from .
I had a dream last night about the three witches .
So do you take her or leave her ?
How exactly have I offended you ?
My lord , I have thought over the request you just made of me .
Now go , set up for dinner .
So have your money ready .
They're ready , my lord .
Here's Decius Brutus .
Lucius , who's that knocking ?
His father was Philip of Macedon , as I remember .
If our eyes were policemen , they might capture two thieves at once while we're embracing .
Who's that ?
Anyone who has a house to cover his head has a good head on his shoulders .
This may have seemed like the pinnacle of sadness , but if I went on I could outdo it .
One last thing , and this is up to you .
Sir , that's well said and well thought out .
I'll wait for her here and when she comes I'll take a novel approach with her .
What are you going to do ?
Oh , that's not true , my lord .
Goodbye .
Let their beds be as soft as yours , and let them eat the same food as you" ?
I do .
Why do you sound so odd ?
Damn you for mocking me .
While I stood spellbound , messengers from the king arrived and greeted me as the thane of Cawdor , which is precisely how the weird sisters had saluted me before calling me 'the future king !
Go back again , to be beaten home again ?
For the sake of our old friendship , I ask you , hold my sword handle while I run on it .
Please remember , love .
Just a moment .
They made more money and got more attention in the city .
If you go outside , arm yourself .
That useless old man still thinks he can wield all the powers he's given away .
And what will happen if I don't ?
No , you were one of Gneius Pompey's leftovers , not to mention your other , more depraved affairs , which have somehow managed to avoid becoming the subject of vulgar gossip .
I'll hide behind the tapestry to hear what they say .
Tell him I want to speak with him .
Fine , but not enough .
God will take revenge .
That makes me love you even more .
Enobarbus , Antony has sent you all your treasure , with generous gifts besides .
I'll get myself a fur-trimmed suit .
He can't go in there because of the candle .
Leave them alone , and do the murder first .
Like a young man who wants to amount to something , this morning begins early .
I have an aunt who is a widow , who's very rich and doesn't have any children .
Sit between us .
Nor is it up to you , my lord .
Tongue , do not speak .
Of course , sir .
She can't deny it .
Why ?
I'm that great gust to her fire .
Then patiently listen to my impatience .
It's too bad .
I confess my crime and throw myself on your Highness's mercy .
I'll kill him !
If you stop up the keyhole , it will escape from the chimney along with the smoke .
What men have you lost , Fluellen ?
In Sicyon .
Sir , I wouldn't say I was your friend , but I've praised you when you deserved ten times more praise than I gave .
Now I have to go find some dewdrops and hang a pearl earring on every cowslip flower .
And since our quarrel is with his future behavior , not what he does now , I must frame the argument like this : if his position is furthered , his character will fulfill these predictions .
Didn't they ever whisper ?
If it pleases your Majesty , it is the token of a man I must fight with , if he's still alive .
And I hope he's studying his music like he's supposed to .
No more foolish talk .
Good morning to both of you .
Your parents are lucky to have such a lovely child .
What are you going to do for a father ?
I'll tear her to pieces !
Thank you , my noble lord .
I'll warm myself by blowing on the fire .
I swear , somehow the fool has been cheated out of all my money .
Damn it , show me what you're going to do for her .
Off with his son George's head !
Then why am I worried ?
But he's young , and as long as he's too young to become king , Richard , the duke of Gloucester , has power over him .
It's Orlando , who triumphed over both the wrestler and you in the same instant .
How's the prince ?
It is .
We will do the same .
Then I will swear to Kate and you to me , and may our oaths be faithfully kept and prove fortunate .
Excuse me , my lord ?
She stood and spoke .
True , he has an excellent reputation .
Does he reward my dedicated service with such deep contempt ?
This is a love token from some other slut , and you want me to copy its pattern for you ?
With my music playing in the background , I'll lure fish .
Blow the trumpets .
Let's not argue here in front of both our armies , which ought to see nothing but love between us .
No , come on , don't make me play a woman .
Until now , no one could say that only one man mattered in all of vast Rome .
Is there anything else you wish ?
Forgive me , darling Rosalind .
But gentle heavens , don't keep me waiting .
Wasn't that Cassio leaving my wife ?
Don't you hear it ring ?
Did you see the king today , Lord Derby ?
Listen !
It's still warm from the cut .
Brutus will lead , and we'll follow him with the boldest and best hearts of Rome .
If you had , the kings that have revolted and the soldier that deserted this morning would still be behind you .
Let the gods who stirred up this dreadful storm bring their enemies to light .
Enjoy your frankness ; it suits you .
Jacob didn't have any control over what happened .
It's not quite that simple .
The world's huge .
He is worth no more than that .
Good night , lieutenant .
If he can manage to walk after our fight , I'll never wrestle for money again .
My lord , welcome this man .
He was more faithful to me than the sun is to the daytime .
Did he ask about me ?
Yes , I'll grant you that .
Stand close together , in case someone loyal to Caesar tries to , Don't talk about standing together. , Publius , cheer up .
Then I have offended no one .
Tell me one .
Even though everything evil wants to look good , good still has to look good too .
Be quiet and depart .
No , I won't .
Leave you alone !
Have a good morning .
You're not being a good friend , Iago , if you even Please don't ask me to tell you .
Will you play this recorder ?
Have him come to me here , soldier .
I'm not coming .
I think he only loves life because of Bassanio .
Yes , I forgot , three months .
I've only been hurt , not killed .
Go !
A rebel !
The adult snake lies in the ditch .
Dolabella .
You're poisoning my eyes .
He has , my lord .
So you couldn't see his face , then ?
If not , the Fates are on the side of the traitors .
Forgotten you !
He received Caesar's letters , and he is coming .
It's obvious : Here comes Biondello .
It was probably just a rumor .
Sir , he may still be alive .
I'll trust my determination and my hands , but none of Caesar's men .
This means we're having some mischievous fun .
It's over here .
I didn't think you could even be so angry .
There !
More , more , please , more .
He is fortifying his castle at Dunsinane with heavy defenses .
If I extinguish the candle , I can light it again if I regret it .
How did he look ?
Don't go back until I've carried the corpse into the marketplace .
I can't remember how I cried then , but I'll cry all over again .
Well put , Maecenas .
He's not sleeping to fatten up his lazy body , but praying , to nourish his attentive soul .
Sir , he's with Caesar .
He's at home , my lord .
Oh , here comes the storm again .
This is the man .
Well , it's as plain as the beaten path to a parish church .
And now they're both gone .
And , my dear sister , as long as the winds are blowing and ships are sailing , let me hear from you , write .
He is , my lord , and safe in Leicester , where , if you'd like , we can retreat to .
Oh , please , Prince Dauphin !
The answer , my dear , is that they didn't dare , because the people of Milan loved me too much .
But wait a minute !
Wait for me there .
There you go .
Foreign savages who eat their own children for dinner will be as close to my heart as you , ex-daughter of mine .
Come on , noble captain .
Good night .
What did he say ?
I'm finished , then .
Oh , madam , my old heart is broken , broken .
You've said it , friend , and farewell to you .
I didn't survive a shipwreck so I could be scared of your four legs now .
My servants might overhear , and old Gremio is still hanging around , so we might be interrupted .
Take me to the man my husband is in debt to .
You'd have to be as lazy as a weed on the shores of I knew it !
Did you find my daughter ?
Come shake hands with Laertes , Hamlet .
I have forgotten your name , but you were well cast in the role and played it convincingly .
Callow youth , you don't yet know how to love !
I'll finish my lecture after dinner .
What can I do for you , sir ?
If she'd been faithful to me , I never would have given her up , not even if God himself offered me a jewel as big as a planet in exchange for her .
Your majesty !
She had a premonition of what has actually happened .
Three-time traitor and whore !
He's the only worthy man in Italy , aside from my dear Claudio .
Come on , let's go at it , Macduff , and damn the first man who cries , 'Stop !
The earth sings when he touches it .
Have his daughters made him crazy like this ? , Couldn't you have kept something for yourself ?
A ghost , a ghost !
On my honor , I swear I love Rivers with all my heart .
You there , rogue , what do you have to say about that ?
My good lords , I plan to .
And I won't be there either. , Edmund , I'm told you've acted like a true son to your father .
My food , my fortune , my sweetest hope , my heaven on earth , and my entrance to heaven .
You're wrong to kill me for loving you .
And that's how she died ?
Eros , my young friend , your captain is now just like that cloud .
He tried to kill me recently , very recently .
A drum !
What I deserve is that you treat me like a queen , and what you deserve is to act like my subjects .
That's what Fulvia told me .
What's the matter ?
But if your soles are worn out , I can mend you .
Have I hugged you yet ?
Absolutely .
Tell us about the letters that you got from France .
She lives about twenty miles from Athens , and she thinks of me as a son .
Up to the breach , you dogs !
Come with me .
There's a feud between the two dukes .
Me too , I won't , I swear to God .
I wasn't born to die on your sword .
Yes , he has .
Is it lost ?
Let me work on him .
Not me .
Oh , on my soul , my cousin has been slandered falsely !
My first question for Nerissa is whether she'd rather wait till tomorrow night or go to bed now , since there are only two more hours till morning .
And does she have to die for this ?
I must be gone .
If he said that , then I hope his malicious soul rots in hell forever .
Shut the doors after you .
I'll prove that I'm an honest man and a man of honor if you dare defend yourself .
Don't trust Trebonius .
You'll have wine enough , my lord , soon .
I'll hide in the arbor .
Their forces are nearby .
And request that she come here .
What does this mean ?
So I will , my liege .
What do you get to drink , instead of sweet obedience , but poisonous flattery ?
Oh , that was unbelievably low !
If the witches tell the truth , which they did about you , maybe what they said about me will come true too .
I can't blame her .
If there are any , speak , for it is he whom I've offended .
If you cut both their throats , then you are the absolute best .
The reason is that it's what I want .
The duke will be here tonight ?
My sword and I will earn our place in history .
Let's listen to him .
I'm asking you to understand my point of view .
You too .
If your Majesties recall it , the Welsh fought very valiantly in a garden where there were leeks growing , wearing leeks in their Monmouth caps which , your Majesty knows , is to this day a badge of honorable military service .
Honest , my lord ?
Good morning , noble sir .
Quiet , quiet , Iras .
Are you the slave who , with your slanderous words , killed my innocent child ?
I hope some will fall off tomorrow .
I don't know what private grudges they had that made them do it .
It's a shame that you walk the streets with all the honest men .
Okay , but tonight doesn't count .
Because who is this man they follow ?
If she were so moral , she would never have fallen in love with the Moor in the first place .
Draw the curtains , just like that .
Goodbye , then .
Listen , Signor Bassanio , there's nothing to worry about .
What do you mean ?
He's so flighty in his old age , as we keep noticing .
Did you talk with this woman ?
Unless my horse goes faster than expected , I will be back an hour or two after sunset .
Hang on , sir !
Why did you once seem lovely to me ?
But let's shake hands , Menas .
The queen is dead , my lord .
These lovers are saying some strange things , Theseus .
Yes , I've been responsible for his upbringing .
But what am I afraid of ?
Where are you going ?
Think about it .
Remember you !
Would you like to taste the banquet ?
My cousin means Signior Benedick of Padua .
There's a spirit in here !
What's your name , friend ?
What are you thinking ?
Welcome .
Captain Macmorris , I think , see , correct me if I'm wrong , there are not many of your nation , My nation ?
All right , sir , I will .
This place is full of trouble , torments , and amazements .
Whatever seems best to you .
In what sense , my lord ?
Therefore , let every man give some thought to how this noble expedition may be undertaken .
But life itself , my wife , and the whole world aren't more valuable to me than your life is .
Come on , what would you say about me ?
How handsome it is .
I'll run from this woman who claims to be my wife as fast as I'd run from a bear .
Here comes better news .
Hey , if I lay down my " Welcome , Lorenzo and Salerio .
But , unfortunately , Caesar has to bleed if we're going to stop him .
These are frightening odds .
If you killed Lysander while he was sleeping , then you're already up to your ankles in blood .
I will not do them wrong .
No , it hasn't , my lord .
I'm waiting here for the general , and I don't want him to see me with a woman .
Why do you come here ?
I wish you could just stammer this hidden man out of your mouth like wine out of a narrow-necked bottle : either too much at once or none at all .
Who wishes that ?
Did he marry me just to starve me ?
I beg you , remember the good work I've done for you , and how I've never lied to you , never made mistakes , and never grumbled in my work .
Don't be afraid of her company .
And he's rubbed himself with perfume .
Richard loves neither me nor any of you .
Look how far that little candle sends its light !
I'll never believe any of these old legends or fairy tales .
Good day to both of you .
Please spare my innocent wife and children ! , Kind warden , please stay with me for a while .
I'm really worried about that .
Let me tell you , my friend , I'm almost insane myself .
Those uncles that you wish were here were dangerous .
You know the law .
If you're joining together to right these wrongs , I'll go as far as any one of you .
March to meet him at a dignified pace .
I swear by my sword , which killed the Shah of Persia and a Persian prince and defeated the Sultan Suleiman three times , that I would face the meanest-looking warriors on earth .
Please put that log down and rest a while .
Will you marry us here , under this tree , or should we follow you to your chapel ?
Okay , so that's when he'll say we stabbed him in his sleep .
What shall I do for you ?
What's happening now , Lucillius ?
Well , then it isn't one to you , since nothing is really good or bad in itself , it's all what a person thinks about it .
I'll speak to him now .
Oh well .
If I agree to this , we may leave unharmed , with our shields undented .
Yes , ma'am .
I pulled it from his wound .
Just as you'd like to have your sins forgiven , Indulge me , forgive me , and set me free .
I'll be crippled forever !
I'll keep my oath and patiently suffer through my anger .
My heart is thirsty for that noble promise .
Don't leave me in the lurch .
Oh God , Horatio , what a damaged reputation I'm leaving behind me , as no one knows the truth .
I don't think it's a good idea .
He'll run after her .
Madam !
Your sweet brother wanted to come meet you , but his mother wouldn't let him .
So I recommend you take note of what I'm about to say .
If not , to tell you I will die is true , but not for love , by God .
I didn't take any more pains bringing this message than you took pains in thanking me .
My good friends , I'll see you tomorrow .
I wish it were over .
He's safe , Antony .
I'm going to take it from you now .
That's the beginning of the day we see , but I don't think we'll see the end of it. , Who goes there ?
The king , sir , has bet that in a dozen rounds between you and Laertes , he won't beat you by more than three hits .
A cat in heat will look for a mate , And Rosalind certainly will too .
I'll go as fast as I can , madam .
You may be exaggerating the risks .
Monster , I'll kill this man .
I swear I'm not lying .
This guy will tell us everything .
Aren't the playwrights hurting them by making them upstage adult actors , which they are going to grow up and become ?
What , not a word ?
Here comes Oberon .
What else ?
Benedick's heart is like a bell , with his tongue as the clapper : everything his heart thinks , his tongue speaks .
The king has broken his heart .
The most beautiful queen they ever had .
Please hear what Goneril is saying .
They'll be married tomorrow , and I'll invite the duke to the ceremony .
Who could have restrained himself , who loved Duncan and had the courage to act on it ?
I'll do so .
Okay , to the point .
Yes , in a very gentlemanly way .
Come , Dolabella .
My money's almost run out .
Is his army approaching ?
So , if all turns out fine , as you say , it's more than we deserve or I expect .
Then , if you dare to acknowledge it , I'll take up my quarrel with you .
Rage on , blow !
As long as they didn't do anything , it would only be a minor sin .
Well then , you must be in love .
The duke went with him to search Bassanio's ship .
You are your father's daughter .
But how is it possible that Prospero's alive and well and living on this island ?
Oh , immortal gods !
Why , Caesar straddles the narrow world like a giant , and we petty men walk under his huge legs and look forward only to dying dishonorably , as slaves .
Do you really think I'm no stronger than the rest of my sex , with such a father and such a husband ?
You will , my lord .
And when you do , Cassius , calm down .
How old is she ?
Don't put me in the stocks .
Now leave me alone , as I said .
When he couldn't what ?
His absence means he's broken his promise , sir .
Good luck , fair gentleman .
And I your servant .
Write to me very soon and I'll let you know what she thinks .
She is dead .
Here he comes .
But where is he ?
The man hasn't done anything wrong .
With who ?
Let's have him land and solemnly proceed to London .
A husband ?
Then if he dies , his death serves him .
Heaven knows I am .
Carry me , good friends , to where Cleopatra is .
I'm not asking you to call her .
There's nothing of the weak woman left in me .
It isn't proper for you to know how much Caesar loved you .
You haven't said anything against the Duke of Cornwall , have you ?
Curse you for your false appearances !
In the time since he left Egypt , he could have traveled an even longer distance .
Speak , speak .
With the permission of Brutus and the others , for Brutus is an honorable man ; they are all honorable men , I have come here to speak at Caesar's funeral .
Please come with me .
And those who leave their valiant bones in France , dying like men though buried in your dunghills , they'll be remembered , too .
Want ?
Well , we'll speak more soon .
We won't , sir .
And just for today , Oh , Lord , just today don't think of the crime my father committed in seizing the crown !
If there's any doubt , there is no doubt .
For lead ?
Listen to our horses neighing , longing to be working .
He's a very proper man .
Ah , all you up in heaven !
I'd rather be a dog and howl at the moon than be that kind of Roman .
I hereby grant your request , and hope you have a good time .
Follow them , please .
Please don't ruin any more trees by carving love poems on their barks .
Let me embrace you .
You wrong me even more , sir , by denying it .
You should know that I think you're a smart man .
giving it back to him .
Or it's bottomless , at least : pour affection in one end , and it runs out the other .
But I spoke with someone who saw Cawdor die , and he said that Cawdor openly confessed his treasons , begged your highness's forgiveness , and repented deeply .
No , he hasn't .
Dear sir , I pity the lady and wish , more for her sake than my own , that I was more able to help her .
I'm off , my lord .
Goodbye .
So I won't give or risk anything for lead .
But now I must condemn it .
Yes , every inch a king .
But I didn't want you to think that I'm hasty in my emotions .
Go away !
Then you'll be able to cheer If he were dead , what would happen to me ?
If the Turkish fleet isn't protected in some harbor , their men must all be drowned .
It's a villain and a bastard and a coward and a rascal .
No , I'm sure your Grace won't be able to persuade him to try a second round , even though you couldn't dissuade him from trying the first .
Four o'clock in the morning .
Is there any news about my husband ?
Goodbye , sir .
My Italy is full of civil war .
Draw your sword !
No , none that you're smart enough to make .
Okay .
Let's fall on our swords .
I'll go to Ireland .
Let me have it now .
This repays me .
And even though I'm in a distasteful mood , I'll work on being happy .
My honorable , reverend master ?
Shall I tell Caesar what you request from him ?
Good Portia , go to bed .
I'll get my revenge before I leave this house .
You get my point , don't you ?
Your brother Don John the Bastard has run away from Messina .
No , nothing .
You talk like a child , but you're very smart anyway .
C'mon , make an effort .
I can't tell who's who .
Calm down , sir , please .
Whoever is already married ( except one person I know ) will stay married , all but one person .
Some of those lines had more feet than the That's not a problem : the feet can bear Sure , but these feet were
I never saw you before in my life .
Say the last word I spoke was "Antony , " and please word it pathetically .
You've lost your resolve .
Some people say that the earth shook as if it had a fever .
I don't know about that .
He has some wonderful home furnishings , that's what he calls them , that he'll use to decorate his house when he gets one .
I'm the ghost of your father , doomed for a certain period of time to walk the earth at night , while during the day I'm trapped in the fires of purgatory until I've done penance for my past sins .
My master said it .
Neither can my accomplishments at sea .
I will settle this matter .
Let's hope we never need your help for anything .
That way Antony will feel like he's fighting his own men .
Sir , we came to see your father's funeral .
It's a friend of Antony's .
Have you heard any news of impending battle ?
Have them come in .
O noble English , who could take on the entire French army with only half their forces , leaving the other half to stand by , idle and laughing .
Good morning , Caesar .
And if you treat us badly , won't we try to get revenge ?
Are you going to take care of this thing now ?
I have only come in , like the others have , to try to fight him with the strength of my youth .
Oh , yes , I'm sorry , uncle. , If you'll excuse me , your grace .
If it's fighting he is after , some of us here should run and hide .
What's amazing is how long he lasted .
My liege .
You .
So confess your sin freely now .
For three months , hmmm .
It scares me just to hear you talk about it .
Is my ink and paper ready ?
Tell me , is it missing ?
Yes , my lord .
He's an admirable man .
It would make any man as mad as a bull to be betrayed like this .
If I told you I understood Greek , I'd be lying .
That huge black cloud over there looks like a filthy liquor jug that's about to pour out its contents .
Get out of here quickly !
No , let's follow him .
There's nothing more .
We have no friends but determination and the quickest death .
Where is my wife ?
There's Dolabella , who was sent from Caesar .
This is what Calphurnia's dream means .
Soon enough .
Look , he's moving .
All right , now I'm starting to lose my cool .
This paper tells me of ten thousand Frenchmen who lie dead on the battlefield .
I'd endure it until he came home again .
If I'd been a god I would've let the sea sink inside the earth before it had a chance to swallow up that ship and all the people it was carrying .
Ever since you lost yours .
What does a crocodile look like ?
As far as I know , he's not even dead .
Yes , I think that's true .
Oh , proud Death , what banquet are you preparing that you've needed to knock off so many princes at one stroke ?
What have you got on your head ?
What is she saying , my lord ?
They say that this town is full of deception , illusionists that can fool the eye , dark sorcerers who can bewitch your mind , soul-killing witches who can disfigure your body , disguised swindlers , fast-talking fakers , and all kinds of other unchecked sins .
Do you really think that if it came down to my word against yours , anyone would believe you ?
Stand further away .
How can they refuse to speak with me ?
You know I'm powerful enough to make you pay for this .
What does the lead box say ?
Crazy" I'm calling it , since how can you say what craziness is except to say that it's craziness ?
He carries a third of the world .
The general and his wife are talking about it now , and she's defending you strongly .
I took your hands in friendship , but , indeed , I was distracted when I looked down at Caesar .
I wish she were in her coffin here , with the ducats in her coffin !
Please sir , if love or money can buy anything in this empty place , tell us where we can rest and feed ourselves .
If we can not defend our country with three times such a power left at home , then we deserve to be harassed by an invader and lose our reputation as a powerful and politically savvy nation .
Your other daughter Regan will treat you kindly , you'll see .
Stay here .
Come on , I won't stand for it anymore .
Here comes Sir Oliver .
You've probably heard about the "change" that's come over Hamlet , that's the only word for it , since inside and out he's different from what he was before .
Othello's career is over .
How are my old friends from this island doing ? , Honey , they'll love you here in Cyprus .
God , I'm crazy about her .
Michael Cassio , lieutenant of the Moor Othello , has arrived on shore .
Getting right to the point , I live near the Capitol .
Why does it matter that I'm not as lucky or lovable as you are and that the love I feel is unrequited ?
Blow the trumpet !
The only thing different about me is my clothes .
Your mother was extremely virtuous , and she said you were my daughter .
She can turn and turn , and then turn on you again .
Read your history !
Swear your love for each other .
If he breaks the peace , he ought to enter into a quarrel with fear and trembling .
What part of the agreement did I break ?
Stop it , I order you .
I'm afraid of what they might encourage him to do , considering the state he's in .
As I neglected practical matters , being totally dedicated to solitude and to improving my mind with subjects more valuable than most people imagine , I was so shut away from the world that I unwittingly stirred up evil wishes in my disloyal brother .
I will have when you hear the rest of what I have to say .
Nothing , sir , except grandchildren .
So please listen to me .
I will say as much to his face .
No , he did not .
Ingratitude is always hideous , but an ungrateful child is uglier than a sea monster !
I am .
Keep an eye on Cinna .
I heard that Julius Caesar got fat from all the feasting there .
Don't worry , I'll be there .
Pretend that you're standing on the shore , watching a city dance on the shifting waves , and you'll have an idea of the look of this majestic fleet as it holds a straight course for Harfleur .
We have to get out of here , old man .
I'll always be loyal to you , sir .
Still , Edmund was beloved .
Keep it from leaving , Marcellus .
That was when I was young and inexperienced and didn't know what passion was .
I'll disguise myself as you and pour out "my" feelings to Hero , taking her prisoner with the force of my love story .
Good night , dear Captain Blunt .
The town is asking for a pause in the fighting for negotiation .
But mistress , know yourself .
Likewise , I'm young , and my sense of reason has just ripened .
It's very hot .
We're all waiting for the revenge !
This Iago is extremely honest and good , and he knows a lot about human behavior .
hundred times .
Many people have told me so .
Yeah , that would get every single one of us executed .
Lay me next to my mistress .
Play with me , Charmian .
Is he crazy with love for you ?
Stars , my lord .
Thanks for letting me go .
I'd like to think all men have some hope .
I don't want to kill you before you've readied your soul .
But please , tell me : is he coming home ?
Give me one good reason to think she's cheating on me .
Who's there ?
I have a That's from lack of sleep .
If only that were all it is , It is , I promise .
Can I do what all the Parthian arrows , though shot by enemies , could not ?
Really , I had no intention of going for my sword .
My mask is like the roof of the poor
Follow him , friends .
Welcome , dear madam .
What news ?
Oh , you If you want to praise Caesar , just say his name , that's all the praise that's necessary .
He can't like her very long .
Stop right now !
Gloucester , it's true that we are in great danger .
Appear before me now quickly , No talking .
Draw your sword , scoundrel , or I'll slice your thighs like flank steak .
Do they attract big audiences ?
I'll follow you .
No , it's dreadfully steep .
This is the door .
I'm speechless .
Is it possible ?
Both fencers are bleeding , how do you feel , my lord ?
On my life I swear to you that your youngest daughter doesn't love you least .
Really , my lord , I don't know what to make of it , but she loves him with such a passion that it's past all understanding .
Just look .
Is this possible ?
Yes , my lord .
Yes , you did .
I'd be peering over maps to figure out the best ports , piers , and waterways .
Political business is bothering him , and he's just taking it out on you .
So were you .
Husband , I'll eat with you in private today and hear your confession about all the pranks you've pulled .
In my imagination , Horatio .
Oh , sad day !
Ask your daughters for another one .
I'll be gentle and mild .
This one talks about how Roderigo should kill Cassio .
Please let me go .
Are any ships leaving tonight ?
I'm ready now .
A backbiting friend , one who grabs people , who patrols the streets and passageways .
But don't let me keep you from going , Cassius .
God save the charitable organization !
Therefore the dukes of Berri , Bretagne , Brabant , and Orleans shall advance , and you , Prince Dauphin , will swiftly entrench and fortify our fortress towns with men of courage and the means to defend themselves .
He's honest , he's got to speak the truth .
I am .
You mustn't hold my earlier outburst against me .
King Lear , I've always honored you as king , loved you as my father , obeyed you as my master , and thanked you in my prayers , I'm furious and ready to snap .
I'll sleep over here .
What is it ?
It's stopped now , it must be played for some local god of the island .
You're a traitor. , Off with his head .
I'm always happy to hear about brave men .
That you love my daughter to spite your soul .
Welcome , good Robin .
What do you say , your Highness , about my just request ?
Our jailers will shrivel up with old age before they make us cry again .
Listen , Clitus .
It's disgraceful !
Why are the branches still living when the root is gone ?
Please , Emilia , ask Cassio where he was at dinner tonight. ,
I'll invite the duke and all of his followers .
Take some men and horses and go to her .
I have no idea how .
I have .
My friend , your husband , the honest , honest Iago .
I'm like the one sick sheep in the flock , the one who deserves to die .
Tell me , who had him arrested ?
Am I not wise ?
Talk makes him crazy .
Then go gather your men , but leave behind your son , George Stanley .
Amen to that !
But it'd take a miracle to make me believe she could do anything that horrible .
Go .
Yes , I thank God , my father , and yourself .
Good idea .
Watch over Signior Leonato's house ; with the wedding being held there tomorrow , there's a great to-do there tonight .
He plans to leave tomorrow .
Well , then , there !
The French have reinforced their scattered men .
That's the way it goes .
He's as brave as a fox .
What's this !
This choice was as foolish as they are .
You take out your sword too .
While the moon was shining we didn't even notice the candle .
Tyrrel , come back shortly after dinner and tell me the details of their deaths .
Pinch my nose ?
We're off , Biondello .
The ship was already sailing .
To tell the truth , though , I think the duke hasn't lost a single man , except for one who will probably be executed for robbing a church , one Bardolph , I don't know if your Majesty knows the man .
That's not a job for a friend , my lord .
Just tell me what you want me to do , and however hard it is , you'll see that I'm eager to do it .
Is it lunchtime ?
The heavens are being stingy with their light .
Hang there on this tree , you lines of poetry , and bear witness to my love .
Stand still .
You'll have to leave tonight .
And I am Brutus , Marcus Brutus .
That's true , that's very true .
Just now we put him in the abbey over here , and now he's over there .
My friends , remember that you're my guests here .
Call out my household servants .
But since the gibe glanced off me , ten to one it hit you both straight on .
With all my heart , Phoebe .
Lovers , moan and weep .
If I can't do that , I can at least make the Moor so jealous that he can't think straight .
Then if they're negligent , we could control them .
When you weren't at home , the Senate sent out three different search parties to find you .
I love you as a child should love her father , neither more nor less .
I didn't .
He should imprison the person who named you , instead .
His heart used to burst the buckles on his breastplate in great fights , but now he's lost all temperance and dedicates his heart to satisfying the lust of an Egyptian whore .
But he's sleeping .
Where is Lucentio ?
That's a good point .
Come on .
I bet my life some evil busybody , some meddling , lying jerk made up this rumor to get some position .
All these new Christians will make the price of hogs go up .
Should be ?
I pity your situation .
Exactly how long is that , do you think ?
Watch him closely .
No drugs or sleeping pills will ever give you the restful sleep that you had last night .
What are you doing , wearing your best clothes ?
If I let myself do what I yearn to , I'd rip the flesh off your bones .
Rogue , you've lived too long !
You asked for justice , so rest assured you'll get more justice than you bargained for .
Oh , my son , what issue is that ?
Her reputation was as pure as the snow , but now it's as dirty and black as my own face .
You'll "never trust his word again." Come on , that was a stupid thing to say .
So be careful .
Come here , boy .
I feel a lot better after talking to this guy .
Phoebe , keep your promise to marry me , and to marry this shepherd if you choose to refuse me .
Isn't this Stephano , my drunken butler ?
She's a remarkable lady , if the rumors are to be believed .
Does a madman scare me when he stares at me ?
Oh that great , funny guy , Bottom !
If you let go of your power to attract me , I won't have any power to follow you .
The dog returns to its own vomit , and the newly washed sow to its mud puddle." You'd take anything for a mistress .
Very good !
When I talked about all these things , Desdemona used to listen attentively .
Well , sir , I'll take you to Lear and have you stay with him a while .
With a needle and thread .
The gods do this to test my bravery .
I hope to God we can make him happy and do him some good !
Let it be a quarrel between us , if you live .
Yes , he was born at Monmouth , Captain Gower .
But don't kill my sister and her royal sons , be satisfied , dear God , with our blood , which is being spilled unjustly , as you know .
Then we'll see that tomorrow night .
Oh , damn her , damn her !
But do you think that's what he's aiming for ?
You lie .
Get up and listen to me .
No , please good Meg , I'll wear this one .
Tell me that I'll marry three kings before noon and be widowed by all of them .
It would be smart to offer someone poor and innocent like me as a sacrificial lamb to satisfy an angry god like Macbeth .
Two thousand ducats a year from his land !
Niece , will you take care of those things I mentioned ?
Madam ?
Is her voice pitched high or low ?
If I'm a wasp , look out for my stinger .
It's a deal .
No , Cassius , no .
What happened , general ?
Halt .
Oh , I'm sure you don't dislike him so much as to wish he were here alone , even though you say this to find out how the rest of us feel .
Once more I come to ask you , King Harry , if you're ready to negotiate your ransom before your certain defeat .
Look in on me , and talk with me , or I'll attack even without a weapon .
You must go to Parthia .
You're mistaken .
Believe me on my honor and keep my honor in mind , so you may believe me .
We'll be there .
Here , here , sir !
The only profit I seek is a peaceful match .
Me too , my lord .
You're rubbing salt in his wounds when you should be applying bandages .
What an ogre you are to slander someone you don't know , and who doesn't know you !
I remember the plan .
It just happens , the way gentle rain drops on the ground .
Who among us stabbed him for any cause but justice ?
Tomorrow is the happy day , Audrey .
Who here is so low that he wants to be a slave ?
No one here is affected by your curse , because curses are just words with no power .
And did they ask you to tell Beatrice about this , madam ?
She had put a wreath of fresh , fragrant flowers around his hairy forehead , and the drops of dew that lay in the center of the flowers made the flowers look like they were crying with shame to be decorating the head of that ugly jackass .
My uncle Clarence's angry ghost .
This sunken-eyed hag was brought here pregnant and left by the sailors .
Let's not , Brutus .
I'll have no halves .
In Rome , Madam .
I'm sure the duke will never allow this contract to be enforced .
I can't go any further .
The French have retreated , see , and there were great acts of courage .
What's going on , my love ?
I'm the one who fathered those bloodsucking daughters .
It may be honest , but it's never wise to bring bad news .
Yes , but swear by my sword this time .
So you took pleasure in bringing me this message ?
My lord , I don't think I cried out .
Cheer up .
When a majestic king starts acting silly , then it's my duty to be blunt .
Your master is a wise and honorable Roman .
Your wit is too courtly for me .
So use your discretion .
Oh , lady , speak again .
The gods know , Oh , never has a queen been so betrayed as I have been .
I agree , Put a mark next to his name too , Antony .
Hello .
There must be something in the air here .
Good to see you , Corporal Nym .
They were nearly killing each other , as you saw when you pulled them apart .
Gentlemanly manners have more sway around here than force does .
Captain , I have a favor to beg of you .
Eros , send his treasure to him .
Yes , a little too sweet .
That doesn't matter .
No , you won't die yourself , but only by proxy .
I've sworn I'll never sleep with him or talk to him again .
Tell me .
So how's my nephew Hamlet doing ?
For the favor of sleeping in her bed .
Let Rome fall !
Come on .
Are you making fun of me ?
Oh , my , it's my husband .
Absolutely , people should be what they appear to be .
It's a pity that fools aren't allowed to speak wisely about the foolish things that wise men do .
If you say my wife is beautiful , eats well , loves good company , speaks freely , sings , plays music , and dances well , you're not making me jealous .
Gertrude , don't drink that .
I'll have you whipped with wire and soaked in brine like a pickle , making your pain linger .
So , listen , Hermia .
Then die and be damned !
He has distinguished himself as a great soldier in his own right , deserving more than any honor your can bestow on him .
Sweet flowers for a sweet girl .
Have all your conquests , glories , triumphs , achievements , come to so little ?
Good Lord , how bright and splendid is the moon tonight !
Then Desdemona and Othello will go back to Venice .
Show me , or at least prove it beyond the shadow of a doubt .
Ah , you sorceress !
Won't the dawn come from here ?
If she's cheated on me , then heaven itself is a fake .
Oh , my daughter !
His horse is killed , so he's fighting on foot , risking his life to search out Richmond .
I wonder what it means .
Tell him I'll take the leek out of his hat on Saint Davy's Day and slap his head with it .
I heard someone say that's what it means .
Who's there ?
Signior Balthasar , you look upset .
I'm already here , sir .
He has already been named king and has left for Scone to be crowned .
Shall I be tempted by the devil ?
Forget your epilogue .
But this is bad !
You unwashed farmworker !
Who am I , sir ?
You don't know what money can buy .
I haven't seen such a promising candidate for your love .
Your request came at a time when the poisonous effects of reveling caused me to be unaware of my own actions .
What kind of scheme do you have going together ?
We can be happy that things have been resolved so agreeably .
Sorry , sir ?
Listen to me patiently .
What do you want ?
I'm ashamed that I yielded to them .
Do you hear , my friend ?
It applies to you as much as to me , my lord .
I won't sleep until I see her , Hortensio .
The next day I explained all this to him , which was as good as begging his pardon .
What garment would your Honor like to wear today ?
Not yet , cousin .
I'll drink as much as you do !
I'll look over the inscriptions again .
Thank you .
They are here at court now , and I believe they've been told to give a performance for him tonight .
I've written to my sister telling her everything he's said .
One of them was a man named Pinch : a hungry , narrow-faced villain ; a skeleton ; a fraud ; a raggedy magician and fortune-teller ; a needy , hollow-eyed , emaciated wretch ; a walking corpse .
Will you please make this half-devil say why he tricked me and damned my soul ?
I was sent for a rope !
Oh , is that Kent ?
They plan to spend the night in Sardis .
You're competing for
The person who suffers alone suffers the most .
What do you need me to do ?
Maybe you will find a husband without a beard .
As long as you move gracefully , look handsome , and say nothing , I'm yours for the dance .
Telling you where he's sleeping is like telling you where I'm lying .
Sweetheart , go on .
I can't , ma'am .
A sailor's wife had chestnuts in her lap and munched away at them .
Who's Thisbe ?
But , sir , here comes your servant .
What's her skin like ?
And when is he leaving ?
Your son Edward , who stabbed my son Edward , is dead .
The moon sets at twelve , right ?
Have the excavators stopped work ?
He sleeps all day like a cat .
Take in the wheeled canons with their deadly gaping mouths trained on the walled city of Harfleur .
Send me away , my lord , but don't kill me !
He has almost finished dinner .
May I speak , Caesar .
Oh , this is wonderful , wonderful , just wonderful wonderful !
You'll fight with him eventually , and The duke , my father , loved his father very much .
I certainly did , and I never wanted to see you again .
Honestly , it's not as good as the other one , and I'm sure your cousin will agree with me .
Tell me again , where did you leave those lowlifes ?
Forever and forever , farewell , Cassius !
He's slept a long time .
Sir , pardon me for what I am about to say .
Who measured the ground ?
I'll say you're not feeling well .
All right , then .
He's been in an unusually good mood and has granted many gifts to your household and servants .
She said something she shouldn't have said , I'm sure of that .
And that necklace around his neck is the very one he swore he didn't have !
A faithful shepherd worships you .
And you're not loyal , like us .
I'm going to rest my head on this little slope .
Give him my respects , and tell him I'll definitely be there for dinner , since I know he has gone to great lengths for this meal .
Excuse me ?
Why are you frowning like that ?
Hands , speak for me !
Lovely , most lovely Katherine , will you agree to teach a soldier the words that would recommend his love-suit to a gentle heart like yours ?
And you will be , or some people here will suffer for it .
Caesar , you thought this would happen .
Venice has made Cassio governor here on Cyprus .
Come with me and let me advise you .
No , I don't , except as a friend .
When the forked blue lightning seemed to break open the sky , I put myself right where I thought it would hit .
Go to him , petition him .
Have you ever slept before while such a terrible deed was done ?
The army is ready .
If I remember correctly , I can't raise the entire three thousand ducats immediately .
I'm torn .
Faster , Eros , faster .
I can't explain it .
It's been proven that Lady Hero is innocent , that the Prince and Claudio have been utterly deceived , and that Don John , who has run away , is the source of all the trouble .
It is not courteous , you know , to assume you know my meaning before I've finished talking .
Make me believe it ?
Tell me what you are .
Mistress , both the man and his master are possessed .
What do you remember ?
By my sword , Beatrice , you love me .
Go lodge a complaint about this with the duke .
You can refuse to make me your spouse , but I'll be your servant whether you want me to or not .
Cicero , I've seen storms in which the angry winds split old oak trees , and I've seen the ocean swell , rage , and foam , as if it wanted to reach the storm clouds , but never before tonight , never until now , have I experienced a storm that drops fire .
Your father's sons would make excellent husbands , if only a girl could catch one for herself .
Let's say goodbye to him .
Yes , certainly .
I enchanted them so thoroughly that they followed me through thorn bushes and prickly shrubs that tore up their shins .
Release me So I can return to my dukedom With your help .
I second that
Please , tell us .
What can you swear by now ?
Pay attention to the music .
What was I saying ?
Your renowned uncle , Duke Menaphon , the famous soldier , brought me here .
It's the devil speaking through him .
I saw Othello's true face when I saw his mind .
Some should go to the public platforms and cry out , "Liberty , freedom , and democracy ! " People and senators , don't be afraid .
No , that's the truth .
Your words and actions don't match up .
By all means .
I'm telling you , it's not lost .
But Edward is still alive .
That's me , sir .
Go on .
Damn it !
There is scorn and disdain in her eyes , and those sparkling eyes despise everything they look upon .
The person who's poor and contented is rich enough .
You call that ranting ?
I'll ask him for my position back again , and he'll tell me I'm a drunk .
We can't go on with this plan .
We're friends !
Learn from the wise , and comprehend : the courtier's perfume is made from cat discharge , much more disgusting than tar .
Were you drunk when you seemed so hopeful before ?
I got it from him .
I ask you , if you have a grudge against me , to kill me now , while your stained hands still reek of blood .
To invite my former boss , the Jew , to dine tonight with my new master , the Christian .
No-the law goes further : if anyone born in Ephesus is seen in Syracuse's marketplaces or if anyone born in Syracuse comes to Ephesus , that man dies , and his possessions will be confiscated by the Duke , unless he can raise a thousand marks to pay the penalty and ransom himself .
You don't know ?
They are .
This is going even better than I planned .
Oh , if I've got any influence over you at all , please patch things up with him .
That with a series of legal writs , Octavius , Antony , and Lepidus have put a hundred senators to death .
Did you see Octavia ?
Imagine , when we talk of horses , that you see them planting their proud hooves in the soft earth .
I want to learn how to lie .
I wouldn't change my mind even if she were
I know him to be valiant .
If you are human , don't stand for it .
As dumb as dirt !
Go , daughter .
Saddle up my horses .
I will , my lord .
I have no idea what you're talking about , Hamlet .
Banquo , if your soul is going to make it to heaven , tonight's the night .
It would be easier to do it in the dark .
You're mistaken about all that .
May God keep you well , sir .
May the devil turn you black , you white-faced fool !
I'll do most of the drinking for you .
I'd rather adopt a child than have one of my own. , Come here , Moor .
I'd like to know .
If he's been spending his leisure time in lustful pursuits , then he'll be punished with venereal diseases , and that's his business .
When a woman is virtuous , talents like these just make her better .
Rest assured that we're going there to use our hands , not our tongues .
Pyramus is coming up to the wall .
Did you just call me "beautiful" ?
Yes , he'll weep stones , as he taught us to do .
They're speaking to him .
What's important is to be prepared .
Don't you have any brothers like you ?
I was too young at the time to appreciate her value , but now I know her .
But in loving me , you would love the friend of France , for I love France so much that I will not part with a single village of it .
Whatever I think , I have to say .
By Jesus , I am your Majesty's countryman , and I don't care who knows it .
What were you before this ?
They're in the heat of passion ; they simply have to be together .
If you could please stop fooling around , I'll tell you what your mother wants .
Stay near me so I'll remember .
Thanks , my good countryman .
If you're a virgin , you'll answer this question .
What did you say ?
It's clear , every man must take responsibility for the manner of his own death .
Thinking , my lord ?
I don't understand why they're all here together .
Before he leaves this part of the forest , you'll change places : you'll be the one running away , and he'll be in love with you .
Anyway , Jessica , go inside .
These are unnatural events .
Yes , as safe as her brothers ' lives were .
The wooing is like a Scottish jig : hot and fast and full of whimsy and illusion .
It's not okay !
The wolves have finished preying for the night , and look , the gentle dawn is rising , dappling the sleepy eastern sky with spots of light .
Tonight we'll wander through the streets and observe the people .
Fulvia's death and the pressing concerns related to it are not the only reasons I am eager to go ; friends in Rome have also sent many letters advising my return .
What woman's servant ?
Tell the king what was happening in the battle when you left it .
I heard myself declared an outlaw and escaped capture by hiding in the trunk of a hollow tree .
I don't know , " he said , "any house , wife , or mistress." My message , which was supposed to be delivered with my mouth , ended up being carried back home by my shoulders .
Now I'll go inside and write out a secret order to keep Clarence's brats out of sight and to forbid anyone whatsoever from seeing King Edward's sons .
And all because I use my own money to make a profit .
You and I can not be held within the confines of a country's arbitrary customs , dear Kate .
But who would dare tell her ?
And servants of the Danish king .
Don't cry , don't cry .
If a man's brain were in his feet , wouldn't it be susceptible to frostbite ?
Get them in here , Nathaniel , Joseph , Nicholas , Philip , Walter , Sugarsop , and the rest .
In that case , the wise gods deny our prayers for our own good .
Most mighty sovereign , you have no reason to doubt my friendship .
Welcome , my lord .
The lowest part of his hoof is more musical than Pan's pipe .
Henry Lord Scroop of Masham , I arrest you for high treason .
Yes , go ahead and moan , because you killed the sweetest , most innocent woman who ever lived !
But where's the money ?
What are you saying ?
I'll be nearby to help you , and between the two of us we can handle him .
I'll just stay here till the storm passes .
Did this fool with the yellow face feast and celebrate in my house today while the guilty doors shut in my face and locked me out of my own house ?
Put on your nightgown .
Where , where ?
This was the most unkind cut of all .
Let those who would mar this fair land's peace with treason die before they can enjoy its wealth .
And look , here's Publius , come to fetch me .
The same to you , my lord !
I have nothing to do with what you're talking about , my lord .
If you wish .
The present time is like a woman in labor , each minute giving birth to some piece of news .
I'll meet you there in an hour .
I heard that Apollodorus carried , What did he carry , please ?
Please , give it to me .
Oh ho , is that what you're getting at ?
And if I were king of it , you know what I'd do ?
I shook you and shouted at you , sir .
It will give you some protection from this storm .
I think the best sign of intelligence will soon be silence , and talking will only be a good thing for parrots to do .
Here comes your father .
My clerk has some comforting news for you , too .
Here , Peter Quince .
Why do you think I'm making fun of you when I tell you I love you ?
I showed it to you once .
I'll vouch for that .
She would make a good wife for Benedick .
I only want idiots following my advice , the advice of a fool .
If it weren't for the fact that so many of our soldiers revolted and joined them , we could have met them out in front of the castle , man to man , and beaten them back to England .
Macbeth will go there to learn his destiny .
Can you ask around and find out ?
Oh , give us permission , great king , to search the field in safety and dispose of our dead bodies .
Your threats are no stronger than her whining. , Helena , I love you .
Didn't he say my brother has run away ?
In private ?
I never heard so loud a voice issue from such an empty heart .
But my heart is still throbbing to know one thing .
I'm not sick if you've prepared some honorable exploit for me .
I mean , what sort of man is he ?
He can't speak , my lord .
Who are the actors ?
I gave it to Dromio , who rushed in for it .
Why are you so rude to someone who loves you so much ?
No , that's not it , trust me .
I feel I should recognize you and that man
What are you doing with a sword ?
How did my master die , Strato ?
He writes brave poems , speaks brave words , makes brave promises , and then breaks them just as bravely .
He is a noble prisoner !
I'm yours forever .
What's your message ?
My worthy lord , your noble friends miss your company .
We are , my lord .
Thank you , brave Cassio .
Well , did you think about what I said ?
If we happen to offend you , it's because we want to .
I wish you could face your bad news like a man !
And , make no mistake , you'll find , as we his subjects have , an amazing difference between the king as a young man and the way he is now .
No .
Tell him my fury will abate , and I'll take the crowns .
It really is good to see you .
Are you there ?
Who put my servant in the stocks ?
He fell down in the marketplace and foamed at the mouth and was speechless .
You do your job well .
Oh , these men , these men !
Wasn't that the best thing to do ?
Oh , what a sad sight !
Only the adulterous and abominable Antony abandons you , giving his power to a whore who turns that power against us .
You'll see , I promise you .
Let's go back to court together , but
If you're smart , you'll go home .
Kind and dear princess !
My name is Thidias .
We understand you're just doing it for us , and we'll be sure to say so .
No thank you , my lord .
Write down that Prince John is a villain .
I won't give up this child for all of Fairyland .
Since Macbeth went to war , I have seen her rise from her bed , put on her nightgown , unlock her closet , take out some paper , fold it , write on it , read it , seal it up , and then return to bed , remaining asleep the entire time .
Also , I've kept my sword unsheathed since I saw this , in front of the Capitol I met a lion who looked at me and strutted by without bothering to attack me .
I'm sure of that .
I don't feel anything .
We have feelings .
No , let me say some good things about you while I'm in the mood .
I tried to play games with God , and he turned my fake prayer on my head , giving me for real what I'd asked for as a joke .
I haven't even heard a mouse squeak .
Either I had to ruin you , or you would have ruined me .
Just looking at him gives me heartburn .
Defend yourself !
And because I know how fond she is of music , playing her instruments , and poetry , I plan to hire live-in tutors for her .
It's good for your fresh wound and your bloody noggin .
I won't be hit , my lord .
He needs to see you right away .
How many noblemen were killed in the battle you just fought ?
He stole it from me .
Cassio , how did you get my wife's handkerchief ?
Sir , I can't .
Though I wish you were dead , I'm not going to be the one to kill you .
Why , he told me so himself , and he said he didn't care who knew it .
At that exact moment , Titania woke up and immediately fell in love with him , an ass .
I'll take all who served Brutus into my service .
This villain is much quicker than I am .
I swear to God it's true , sir .
If you refuse , let an eternal curse fall on you .
Here I am at your service , my dear lord .
Excuse me , sir. , Tom's chilly .
His name !
You'll have to bear with me .
Lovely Katherine , if you will love me well with your French heart , I'm happy to hear you confess it in broken English .
Both of you are very welcome here .
Send him on his way quickly .
He gets up at nightfall and wanders around till dawn .
I never saw a better-designed gown , more elegant and pleasing and well made .
If I stay longer , I'll embarrass you and disgrace myself by crying .
Did she give up all those chances to marry noblemen , give up her father and country and friends , just to be called a whore ?
It's true I heard a humming sound , a strange one , which woke me up .
A thin face , which you don't have ; a sleepless , sunken eye , which you don't have ; an irritable temper , which you don't have ; a neglected beard , which you don't have , but that might not be so telling , since you don't have much beard anyway .
What's the matter with you now ?
Are you sick ?
Oh Ratcliffe , I had a terrifying dream !
If our secret's known , either Caesar or I will die , for I'll kill myself .
Madam , hurry as fast as you can get out of my court .
Come on .
The pig or the mighty or the huge or the magnanimous , they all mean the same thing , with some variation .
What do you want ?
Look , it's going away .
What's she doing now ?
Look at this man .
From a certain knight who swore on his honor that the pancakes he was eating were good , and that the mustard on top of them , he swore on his honor , was bad .
I hope you're an expert in your field .
And your father was Duke of Milan , and you were his heir , a princess .
Please , somebody , get us out of here !
After midnight , for two nights running , these two guards , Marcellus and Barnardo , saw a figure that looked very much like your father , in full armor from head to toe .
People who want to start a big fire quickly start with little twigs .
He doesn't miss a thing .
Nerissa's got the right idea .
It's true , that wasn't such a nice thing to do .
What a righteous judge !
And that's true too .
This is amazing .
But fortune could not reward me better than to let me die well , without owing my master anything .
With a doctor's help he might recover and become an ass again .
If you fight to protect your wives , your wives will welcome you home as conquerors .
Oh yes , to smell This is Signor Antonio .
Usually fathers produce children , not the other way around .
Here comes the noble Antony .
And what should I give you that would be equal in value to this rare and precious gift ?
In fact , the real nightmare had only just begun .
Tell me , you unknown power , He can read your thoughts .
Go get it and bring it to me here in the orchard .
This is how God forces wicked men to turn their swords against themselves .
I don't have to give you answers that you like .
Then your lips will feel them more quickly .
Would you walk out with me , sir ? , Oh , Desdemona , Yes , my lord ?
But as for now , before two weeks have gone by , I'm going to send some people packing .
Sure , I hate her , but I wouldn't hurt her .
I wish I had never seen it !
The tunnels !
And I think this is his house .
Good-bye , good-bye , good-bye .
Fine , thank you .
But if you have sex with her before the marriage ceremony takes place , the heavens will not bless your relationship , but will overwhelm you with hate , contempt , and discord , and will poison your marriage bed so that you both grow to loathe it .
I pardon that man .
I hear a voice more piercing than the music of these trumpets calling "Caesar ! " Speak .
Hortensio , what's all this about ?
My father and mother coupled when the demonic moon was descending , and I was born under the Big Dipper , so it's inevitable that I'm rude and oversexed .
Why , madam , have I offered you my love only to be flouted in front of the king ?
Was it long or round ?
What three things does drink make a man do ?
I need to hear the truth about all this .
His cowardly lips turned white , and the same eye whose gaze terrifies the world lost its gleam .
You're not responsible for my death and my father's , and I'm not responsible for yours .
You , my earthly moon , are now eclipsed , and that alone foretells my ruin .
Now , sir , where is Claudio ?
My Cordelia , even the gods admire how much you've sacrificed for me .
Dressing my out-and-out wickedness in scraps of Scripture , I look like a saint exactly when I'm most like the devil .
Will you abandon such gentle lambs , God , and throw them to the wolves ?
Yes , right now .
Do you know any , Hero ?
Believe it .
And it might back up other evidence that may seem too flimsy .
They swore that you were nearly dead with love for me .
Very nice to see you , sir .
My fair Bianca , bid my father welcome , while I with equal affection welcome yours .
You know why I think so ?
Maybe you should ask , what will you do for a husband ?
It's getting late .
We'll watch a whole play tomorrow .
What , that's all ?
No doubt it will , my liege , if each man does his best .
Now this is where you come in .
Go find out the news .
Oh , let me kiss his hand !
Wash your hands .
God save your Majesty .
Go hide , Adam , and you'll hear how he abuses me .
Duke , please go ahead with your state business .
You heard her say it wasn't me .
Why , so did you .
Who sent you here ?
But honestly , I should have been a woman .
How are you , my friend ?
When he raised his arm in command , the world trembled .
Dress me up in motley .
If I had as many sons as I have hairs on my head , I couldn't hope that any of them would die more honorably than he did .
It was my magic that saved you when I arrived on the island and heard you , making the pine tree open and let you out .
We'll do it .
Over your wounds , which , like speechless mouths , open their red lips , as though to beg me to speak , I predict that a curse will fall upon the bodies of men .
Twenty thousand crowns now , and half my lands after my death .
And she can cry , sir , oh , how she can cry !
I swear by the sun that when I leave here , it will be as your faithful servant .
Well , for your good looks , sir , thank God and don't boast about it .
Iago .
All that glitters is not gold , You've often heard that said .
I wouldn't have given it away for a whole jungle of monkeys .
I want to drink your health .
Go to hell , you whore !
I could live a thousand years and I wouldn't be as ready to die as I am now .
The sentence I've passed down on her is firm and unshakeable .
When I have praised Antony , I've disparaged Caesar .
No .
Well , let's get out of here and tell Macbeth what we did accomplish .
So the life that died with shame Lives on with fame .
I've had very little joy as England's queen .
I think she'll be a better soldier .
But their trick failed .
No .
Here comes another Jew .
What a miserable and obstinate fellow this king of England is , to blunder with his fat-headed followers so far beyond his capacity .
We all expect a nice answer from you , Jew .
But wait a minute , please .
Don't stay to answer me , get going .
Good day , Lieutenant Bardolph .
Tell me who shall have the better luck , Caesar or me ?
Don't miss our feast .
Can he even get angry ?
I can't do everything I want to , but I'll help you as well as I can .
Your Highness just told me that I should ride there before you .
Three of the carriages are very imaginatively designed , and they match the fencing accessories .
I doubt it , since you weren't even three at the time .
Come here , herald. , Let the trumpet sound ! , Read this out .
You're so much older than you look !
My beautiful queen , we'll go up the mountain and listen to the hounds as their barking echoes in the cliffs and sounds like music .
The king has strictly forbidden it .
Oh God , I wish the two of them were alive and living in Naples , as king and queen !
Oh , yes , we could , sir .
Farewell , good Salisbury ; and may good luck go with you .
She deserves to have rocks and stones thrown on her body .
Thieves !
I beg you , Strato , stay by me .
What , have you forgotten me ?
Oh no , my reasons are deep and as permanent as death .
Cheer up and be at peace .
Why did you do that ?
I will sit here in the middle .
Write them together , yours is just as good a name .
I'll tell you , good Brutus .
Can't any prayers reach your heart ?
Now , please , I beg you , don't work so hard .
I can tell that something wicked is coming by the tingling in my thumbs .
Iago's a good man .
Beatrice , I swear , I'm going .
But his navy rules the sea .
He's having a fit and talking nonsense .
He and I will make up .
Kent , if you want to stay alive , stop talking .
I have bankrupted three tailors .
Here he comes .
Oh , I'm sick , sick !
Was the Duke of Milan kicked out of Milan so his children could become kings of Naples ?
But how is it possible that you still remember this , through all the darkness of the past ?
Just as a town protected by a wall around it is worth more than a low-lying village , a married man's horned forehead is more honorable than a bachelor's bare forehead .
Well , if it wasn't her , I don't know .
Greed has been the downfall of many kings .
Oh , I'm out of breath from this foolish chase .
Go to your tomb !
Yes , he did .
Or maybe , to make it even more lovely , I'll sing it when the heroine dies .
Farewell .
Against my brother Lucius ?
It's not safe to go near them till we get more help .
But there's more work to be done .
Good-bye .
I hope we have the time some day !
It's nine o'clock .
You've stolen both my job and my name !
Can any horse retrace his footsteps with the same energy he had when he walked them the first time ?
If she welcomes him and his hundred knights after I've shown how inappropriately he's behaved , Here , ma'am .
My lord , good morning .
Yes .
I want to do a little good despite my evil nature .
If I can tell him that you have submitted to him sweetly , he'll request your assistance in finding ways in which he can support you .
I'm really a pitiful singer .
Some kinds of lowly activities are done for noble reasons .
Her father is Baptista Minola , a pleasant and courteous gentleman .
Let's carry him to the barracks .
Get out , you horrible poison .
Quiet !
I don't feel guilty about them at all .
We don't want it at our festivities .
You go and take care of your business ( since everybody has some business to take care of , whatever it is worth ) , and I'll go and pray .
Take away this lout and whip him .
With his ambition growing like this , do you hear what I'm saying ?
Did we , my lord ?
Wasn't Don John at dinner tonight ?
I need to speak a word with you .
What does she want ?
Your grandsons will neigh to you like horses .
You've served me faithfully .
I could take back my crown by force , What outrageous ingratitude !
Good running , Thisbe !
Oh , it's horrible of her .
Come with me and I'll get it for you .
The Lord in heaven bless you , noble Harry !
Oh !
I don't feel any urge to see a more handsome man than this one .
Let me destroy myself , let heaven and destiny deprive me of happy hours , let day remain dark and night sleepless , and let me have nothing but terrible luck if I do not love with a pure heart , clean devotion , and holy thoughts your beautiful royal daughter .
Good morning , sweet Hero .
So you're admitting Clarence , my father , is dead .
Are you his friend ?
Have you snuck over here to watch the wrestling ?
A god of a god ?
Meet me in a little while at the citadel .
Is it a habit of his ?
What's wrong , cousin ?
And I've never met any men besides you and my father .
Everyone knows where a wasp wears its stinger .
I am their mother .
You lie .
It will rain tonight .
It was yesterday , your highness .
Would you try to lift Mount Olympus ?
Yes , the second time around , since , as they say , old people become children again .
He'd better not speak badly of Brutus here .
Go then , slave .
No , Kate ?
Go away .
I'm not .
How can you ever hope for mercy for yourself , when you don't give any now ?
I think he will stand strong with us .
Stop , Demetrius !
I'll get him to come here , and you can ask him yourself .
Ask him to go in .
Please don't take my niece the wrong way , sir .
Exactly .
I've promised them I would , and they're expecting it .
I can assure you that no enemy will ever take the noble Brutus alive .
So , tell me , assuming I win your daughter's love , what dowry would she bring to the marriage ?
That's what I want you to tell me .
And as wise as a goose .
Enough !
And I've built two chapels where solemn priests sing continually for Richard's soul .
That's true , sir .
How could you ask ?
Should we now dirty our fingers with lowly bribes and sell the mighty offices that we hold for whatever money we can get our hands on ?
Are you his brother ?
I'm about to fly away .
I'm very sorry you're not feeling well .
Did you see him enter this abbey ?
There's always a breath of fresh air here .
No ship could survive this storm .
I will harp on it till my heartstrings break .
Tell Ventidius I want to speak with him .
Our masquerade mates are waiting for us .
Is that what you've heard ?
If not , I'll challenge you to a duel .
Now , Brutus , you have only yourself to thank .
This damned witch Sycorax was kicked out of Algiers for various witching crimes too terrible for humans to hear about .
Some French agents are already at work in our main ports and are on the verge of declaring open war .
You're sick , yet you sneak out of your warm bed and let the humid and disease-infested air make you sicker ?
My dear Caius , I'll explain the task at hand to you as we walk toward the man we must do it to .
I think that on a night like this , when the wind blew the trees so gently that they didn't make a sound , On a night like this , On a night like this , On a night like this ,
Still , I'd hate to see my former dreams return .
But don't I have good reason to cry ?
My daughter told me everything .
Go on .
Ah , this place is too cold to be hell .
Pain , yes indeed .
Know him ?
Maybe they call me that because I am cheerful .
But shhh !
Go now and get cash .
I look forward to getting to know you better , Mr. Mustardseed .
Don't listen to the bell , Duncan , because it summons you either to heaven or to hell .
Kingly power seems most like God's power when the king mixes mercy with justice .
They've recorded my crimes , and I would rather die than have to retell this shameful story .
Grandmother , this would have been a biting joke .
The princes are under some strange misunderstanding .
Ha ?
You know what , my lord ?
Please do .
From then on we'll turn our backs on Athens .
If you're as good at pleading to them as I am at saying no to you , this will definitely come to a happy end .
Therefore , do your duty and take your reward , because my master and mistress are nearly frozen to death .
How could I forget , my lord !
Look what I have here .
Whatever you are , thanks for your advice .
In suicide , gods make the weak strong .
Calm down , Kate .
In any case , our survival depends on putting together the strongest force possible .
Shall we call in the ambassador , my liege ?
Tell me where you've stowed away my money , or I swear I'll break that comical head of yours for goofing when I'm not in the mood .
If you regard it as shameful , put the shame on me .
This tyrant , whose mere name is so awful it hurts us to say it , was once considered an honest man .
Yes , my lord , if you would like .
I have a ship full of treasure .
Didn't you say something ?
A rotten , foolish monster .
Then , hold my sword and turn your face away while I run on it .
Speak .
I'd rather have my horse than a mistress .
Write down "Master Gentleman Conrade." , Gentlemen , are you good Christians , and do you serve God ?
If you'd been as wise as you were bold , With an old man's mature judgment , You wouldn't have had to read this scroll .
I will , as surely as I am a gentleman .
I've done no more to Caesar than you will do to me .
Isn't he a horrible man ?
This is what happens when you visit whores .
Does it mean being truthful ?
I don't believe it .
What you told me it haunts me like a nightmare , he's got my handkerchief !
Othello , I've been seriously hurt .
I've heard that's not the most nourishing food .
You won't regret this .
Oh , Kate , prudish customs bow before great kings .
I'm sorry to have to say this , Help me away from here , dear Charmian !
No , let's not swear an oath .
It's locked away in my memory , and you've got the key .
Do it .
Yes , just like this .
Treat me well .
Why do you ask ?
But give words a chance .
When you have said your lines , go hide in that bush. , Everyone else , go there too when you're not onstage .
A prison like that would give me enough liberty .
Cut yourself ?
Do you have unusual snakes there ?
crowned by the golden sun , observed his heroic son and smiled to see him mangle the work of nature , French youth whose fathers and God had nurtured for twenty years , since they were babies .
Because , you know , Pyramus and Thisbe meet by moonlight .
Like hell she is !
Yes , the leader of the team ; the one that gets you if you can't pay a debt ; the one who assumes people are always going to bed and says to them , "Have arrest." Well , sir , stop your joking there .
Let's not fight over this fellow .
I dreamt about this .
How wonderful my master is !
It's almost four .
I think she's the most wonderful woman I've ever laid eyes on .
No , I'll slit the nose of the villain who would have sent me to jail .
I'll go get them , sir .
The sun glints off our armor .
How could it be wisdom !
Really ?
Richard has set boundaries between my love and theirs ?
A governor shines as brightly as a king until a king is near by , and the governor suddenly looks like a nobody .
I'll break my spells and bring them back to their senses , and they'll feel like themselves again .
And how was that one settled ?
I will have to go on a journey to death soon , sir .
This is the jester I have met so many times in the forest .
That's enough .
Reborn .
Only one man in ten thousand is good in this world .
Remember March , March 15th .
Good morning , General .
Bianca's love made me trade places with Tranio while he masqueraded as me around town .
He lay there , stretched out like a wounded knight .
All this suggests that she has a good reason for doing this to you .
I'll meet you there .
With this marriage , all the petty jealousies that now seem huge , and all the great fears that are dangerous in themselves , would disappear .
Live , live !
Very obedient , keep crying. , Concerning this , oh , what fake emotion ! , I am being ordered home , Get away from me , I'll send for you later. , Sir , I'll obey the order and return to Venice .
Stay calm .
I could go on weeping like a woman and bragging about how I will avenge them !
That's a good way of putting it .
But now , I tell you , keep it to yourself , though , those enemies of mine are being put to death today , and I'm better than I've ever been .
Your name's Gloucester .
Your ear is good .
They have fully sixty thousand fighting men .
Therefore it's certain that he wasn't ambitious .
The chicken is burning , the pig is overcooked , the clock has already struck twelve , and my mistress has clocked me one on the cheek .
Thanks for your company but , really , I would have preferred being alone .
So it's not my business that's making me sad .
Her
That's why there must be space between you .
Prepare yourselves .
If you had any sense of pity , or manners , you wouldn't pretend to fight over me like this .
We'll go visit Caliban , my slave who always talks to us so nastily .
It's almost ten o'clock .
My master is standing out in the street !
No .
Welcome to the open air again .
I'll leave you now .
She lied to me , and she may lie to you .
Oh , Stephano , two men from Naples survived !
Startle even the sky with the sound of your lances cracking .
Good duke , come receive your daughter .
So have a seat and talk to her .
I would like to prove to you that I am .
I hope all reports about me simply tell the truth , no more or less .
Oh , don't fight by sea , noble Emperor !
Look up moonshine , look up moonshine !
If I could shoot lightning bolts from my eyes , I can tell you who'd be on the ground .
May God's blessing go with you and with all who turn bad into good , and enemies into friends !
Look , I have a weapon , the best sword a soldier could have .
Thrice noble lord , I beg you to excuse me for another night or two , or at least until nightfall .
But she has had prayers read for her and is dressed up like a pure virgin , with flowers tossed on her grave and the bell tolling for her .
Don't be silly !
Well , my good fellows , wait on me tonight .
So go .
There she is , over there .
A lioness gave birth in the streets , and graves cracked open and thrust out their dead .
If he is too insistent , tell him that romance is like a dance : it has its own rhythm and timing .
The king sent us to give you his thanks and to bring you to him .
Lovell , go as fast as you can to Doctor Shaw .
Macbeth !
Sir , I know you , and I trust you enough to share something very important with you .
Got it , sir .
If it's the same one , If it's the same one , or any one that belongs to her , then together with the other evidence it's pretty strong .
But things have changed there , and it's easier for them on the road now .
Bottom !
This is Lucentio's house .
Or was it a blessing that we came here ?
Besides , he's young and handsome , and he's got all the qualities that naive and silly girls go for .
Look , here comes Cassio and my husband .
We're ready for both , my lord .
But I'm old now , and suffering has weakened me .
I think they want him to go home and appoint Cassio governor in his place .
Here are the rulers of France and Burgundy , my lord .
Would he have snuck away from me while I was asleep ?
It's easy for a liar to pretend to feel sorrow when he actually feels none .
As old and white-haired as you are , and you're such a traitor ?
Actually , I should .
The words expressly specify "a pound of flesh." So take your penalty of a pound of flesh , but if you shed one drop of Christian blood when you cut it , the state of Venice will confiscate your land and property under Venetian law .
Do you recognize this face ?
His spirits are listening to me , but I can't help cursing him anyway .
To be good-looking is a matter of luck , but to read and write is a natural gift .
Disgusting !
I'd like to introduce you to my friend .
You were sent for .
Here comes Ensign Pistol and his wife .
Eat your dinner and pay no attention to him .
Before you can say "Come" and "Go , " And breathe twice , and shout "So , so ! " Each one of your servants will rush here ,
I'm an honest Puck , and I swear that if we're lucky enough not to get hissed at , we'll make it up to you soon .
I loved Ophelia .
Really , I'm only pretending to be him .
Affection ! " That's nothing !
Therefore , tell me , what is he doing at sea ?
Have you ever cured anyone this way before ?
When should the royal day be ?
Only children are afraid of scary pictures .
How are you doing , Stephano ?
They won't pinch me , frighten me , push me in the mud , or mislead me unless he tells them to .
No .
All right , we'll have a prologue then .
No .
Where's the king ?
I spoke with a Frenchman yesterday who said that a Venetian ship loaded with treasure was wrecked in the English Channel .
My father , I think I see my father .
Look , Lucius , here's the book I was searching for .
You must be crazy to say that !
It's so simple !
He may command me as my king , but you still have power over me as a relative .
What does Lord Stanley say ?
What you just said may perhaps be true .
Did you hear her speak ?
A man , sir .
Who's there ?
Thank you , and God bless you for your hospitality .
This is the time of night when witches come out , when graveyards yawn open and the stench of hell seeps out .
Maybe she's just pretending .
What ?
This must be some kind of fairyland .
I don't know .
Why , the one I just told you about .
If it's me , there's no time as good as this hour of Caesar's death , and no weapon better than your swords , covered with the noblest blood in the world .
Don't you know that I'm a woman ?
Somebody's knocking .
The duke of Exeter has held the bridge very gallantly .
Since nobody knows anything about what he leaves behind , then what does it mean to leave early ?
Twenty-five , sir .

I have a bad cold that's bothering me .
Then , to answer every man briefly , wisely , and truthfully , wisely I say , I am a bachelor .
I did , kind lady .
Good lieutenant , is your general married ?
You haven't got it in you to frown or look displeased or bite your lip as angry women do .
I assure you , sir , the tender love I feel in my heart is stronger than the sexual passions stirring down below .
Sweet Moon , I thank you for your sunny beams .
I ate with him and my sister .
You know I gave it to you just now .
But why aren't you in your shop today ?

And as long as she's herself , wise , beautiful , and faithful , she'll always have a place in my heart .
I remember wooing a pea plant in her name , and then taking two pea pods and begging her to wear them "for my sake." Those of us who are really in love will do the strangest things .
Tell me why , if you can .
Sir , what is your opinion of me ?
Do you know where I'm going ?
A deed that will make sick men healthy .
My lord , I have news for you .
What seems sweet to him now will soon turn bitter .

You may really be honest , no matter what I think .
Where have I been ?
A sweet woman !
Listen , Guildenstern , and you too , Rosencrantz , listen as close as you can !

Isn't that him ?
Yes , and his relative , too .
Hold on a moment , and listen to my advice .
How are you doing , Charles ?
I've told you what I intend to do , and I've sworn by the holy Sabbath to seek the penalty that is due according to our contract .
Yes , and a nice one at that .
Shylock , are you listening ?
Arm yourself .
How is my generous sister ?
Dear son , you're alive !

Good-bye .

Well , by this I can see that you don't love me as much as I love you .
I'll go put my armor on .
Hang on a minute , who are you ?
No .
Antonio , I married a woman as dear to me as life itself .
God will free you from blame .
Who is this fool who wants all the fuss of marriage ?
What do you have to say to me ?
Do you like pictures ?
The sound is going away .

My lord ?
He's gone ?

Here , I give you my blessing again .
Unpunished !
I haven't spoken to him since I sent him away from the marketplace earlier .
The general should be informed about this .

What have I said in my grief ?
Where will the old duke live ?

Poor man !
You get only one round .
Let me go with you .
But even if I thought you were right , it doesn't matter .

Should I strike it with my spear ?
Who's blocking the way ?
Let go of his arm .
As absolute a traitor as any in the whole entire world , or even France or England !
I'll do it , but I don't like it .
The problem is that they have to compete with a group of children who yell out their lines and receive outrageous applause for it .
Claudio ?
So , by Christ , I'll cut off your head .
It's a measly little cap , a dessert crust , a plaything , a silk pie .
You wouldn't have dared to tempt him so .
He gives BIONDELLO Here comes Baptista .
Cure her of that .
She can't stand to hear about getting a husband .
Is your other mouth calling my name ?
What kind of help do you need ?
But why should my reputation for honor last longer than my honor did ?
These chatty fellows who can rhyme their way into a lady's good graces always reason themselves out again .
You're supposed to show that you understand that Pyramus just went to check on a noise he heard and is coming right back .
I didn't expect any better from him once he got involved with Mistress Shore .
Why , friends , you don't even know what you're doing yet .
Claudio deserves to be honored , and Don Pedro has rewarded him accordingly .
Heaven knows you're as unfaithful as hell .
Good afternoon , my dear lord !
Come to think of it , I thought I felt a scab there .
Damn it , this isn't funny .
She has royal blood .
I must tell you then .
Some men don't like roast pig , others go crazy if they see a cat , and others can't help urinating when they hear bagpipes .
Our bodies are like gardens and our willpower is like the gardener .
I find you quite gentle .
No .
How does it feel to be Benedick the Married Man ?
That upsets me much more than getting wet .
Come on , tell me in broken music , for your voice is music and your English broken .
That's right .
Pull only his name out of his heart and let him go .
The devil's after me !
True .
Run , run , oh , run !
The muffled queen" ?
It's true .
It's better to act virtuously rather than vengefully .
How will I recognize you in the future ?
Pay a surgeon to stand by and bind his wounds , Shylock , so he doesn't bleed to death .
Do that , and I'll set you free in two days .
She's still at the monastery , kneeling and praying for a happy marriage .
Where would Othello go ? , Oh , look at you !
I thought the clouds were talking to me , the winds were singing to me , and the thunder , like an awful organ pipe , roared Prospero's name .
What woman wouldn't be distressed , being lorded over by a handful of dust ?
I can not blame you now for weeping .
Are you sick ?
Should I tell you why ?
If I can believe my eyes , this is a fine sight to see .
No , the one I gave you .
That was the limit for me .
If you read this , Caesar , you might live .
But here comes Antony .
But who is this ?
There was no end to his generosity .
Only to watch that title become worthless , as her mother has .
No , no , no , no !
That's the one , sir .
Have faith , love me , and you will get better .
Yes , with Cassio .
She went from me , who loved her with the dignity and devotion that suits a legitimate marriage , to a wretch whose natural gifts were poor compared to mine .
Welcome .
What's going on these days ?
And since I wooed her in your name , I'll join you in disgracing her .
Alas , I am the mother of all these others ' griefs .
You're in the charge of an honorable man .
Oh , if you could speak , I might hear you call Caesar an ass who's been outsmarted !
The sailors are all below deck , sleeping both from their labor and from a magic spell I cast over them .
But for your private satisfaction , because I love you , I'll tell you .
Who does time amble for ?
Then we won't agree to his demands .
I've got you now , pagan .
She would have died later anyway .
Murder ?
His daughters want to kill him .
I'm ordering you , go home .
Aren't the mayor and his fellow citizens coming ?
I'm serving under him to take advantage of him .
If you like what you see of the land , the profit that's possible , and this rustic life , I'll be your faithful servant , and buy the place with your gold right away .
If you tickle us , don't we laugh ?
Oh , Tranio , until it happened to me , I never would have thought it possible .
Oh wise judge !
Will it be tonight at supper ?
I would rather wrong the dead , and wrong myself and you , than wrong such honorable men .
Keep my lover quiet .
If so , when it's day , where are you going to find a cave dark enough to hide your monstrous face ?
I have the motivation , the willpower , the ability , and the means to do it .
You'd better not make that suggestion , Agrippa .
It's as complete a work of villainy as any that could be thought up .
Please tell your brother what a convincing show I put on .
But I have known people who sleepwalked and weren't guilty of anything .
I'm coming , slut !
Everything may still be all right .
Okay , bring on the play .
He has the wisdom to act bravely but also safely .
Give me my armor .
If we lose this battle , this is the last time we'll speak to each other .
I'm sweating and trembling with fear .
The prince has far outgrown me .
When will we get to the top of that cliff ?
Go back with her ?
Let that be enough for you .
You should get a wife !
I wish none of this had happened , given the situation here , and your rank .
Whatever happens tonight , don't talk about it .
In short , I'm not .
He doesn't know what he's saying .
A simple country farmer who brought her figs .
Carthage ?
To me it looks like a weasel .
Talk to him .
The Lord Grandpre .
Your eyes look like they've sunk into your head .
If what you feel is really love , tell me how much .
What an idiot I was to think this drunkard was a god and to worship such a stupid fool !
It's a job meant for a man , but not you .
And our drunkenness does detract from our achievements , as great as they are , and lessens our reputations .
Call my guard , please .
But the critics and I found it to be an excellent play , with well-ordered scenes that were clever but not fancy .
There goes a strong fellow , Menas .
But then again he's never really understood his own feelings very well .
How dare you try to be my friend when you refuse to fight my enemy .
You liar , you're turning my heart to stone , and making me call what I'll do murder , when I had been thinking of it as a sacrifice !
What are you going to do now ?
I used to be the man in the moon a long time ago .
Swear by her foot , so she can stamp out the oath .
We have in fact seen better days and been summoned to church by the ringing of the holy bell and sat at good men's feasts and cried tears of pity , therefore , sit down and take whatever will satisfy your needs .
Yes , if a woman grows up to be a man .
He spends most of his time with the good , noble Claudio .
Come on , sir .
I'll tell you privately .
So Litio's out of the picture .
The people have heard it already , and they've been told of his accusations .
As king of this country I like to reward wit when I hear it .
Here .
And so , on the wings of imagination and at the speed of thought , our scene flies swiftly on .
You can stand in his place .
Well , your imprisonment won't last long .
It astounds me that such a weak man could beat the whole world and carry the trophy of victory alone .
If anyone doubts this , let him put me on trial .
Now let me tell you , Casca , I have already convinced some of the noblest Romans to join me in an honorable but dangerous mission .
Do you like her , Claudio ?
That's noble of you , master .
I'm afraid you've sold your own land to see other men's .
It said , "Love me and don't leave me." How can you talk about the quality of the poem or the value of the ring ?
I'd rather break my own heart .
What's the matter ?
God be good to you !
I think he'll carry this island home in his pocket and give it to his son like an apple .
I won't answer that .
The king has been informed of all their plans , but they have no idea .
The watchdogs bark .
This letter from Bellario introduces us to a young and well-educated legal expert .
If it's really you , tell me what happened to our son , who floated away with you on that deadly raft .
Stand back .
His imagination is making him crazy .
A murderer should look like you do , so pale and grim .
We'll watch them starve to death first .
If not , then I'm a liar .
There's magic in its fabric .
Clever lies .
If you wish to speak of love , speak more softly .
She'll die for it. , Eros , ho !
I'll die You're of royal blood , and we obey you .
We'll have to think about it carefully .
I don't think you're treating me fairly .
Hurry up , Robin , and make the night dark and cloudy .
Sister , let's eat and stop worrying .
He is the prince of horses .
No , you shall not .
My father's ghost , armed !
It's strongest in the strongest people .
Kent , father , sisters !
Indeed you did , and more besides , Miranda .
I wish I knew what is happening .
When are you getting married , madam ?
Look , here she comes !
In saving you I consider myself well paid .
Which one of them did it ?
Mistress , think about your end , beware of your death !
The next man who swings his sword must not care about his life , because the instant he strikes , he dies .
Shall I let them exhibit me to the shouting mobs of Rome ?
Who are you talking about , niece ?
Oh , I wish you weren't , you poor , frightened soul .
Your horn is a foot long , and I'm at least that size .
Heaven help him !
Yes , leave that labor to great Hercules , it's worse than the previous twelve put together .
Come , gentlemen , let's go in .
A pound of human flesh taken isn't even as valuable as a pound of mutton or beef .
Our era should be ashamed !
Since he has the jewel I loved , which you swore you'd keep forever , I'll be as generous as you were to him .
Murder !
Get up , get up , and look at this image of doomsday !
Wasn't it just yesterday that we spoke to each other ?
who can control his fate ?
Treat me like you would treat a dog , kick me , hit me , neglect me , try to lose me .
My lord , I have some mementos of yours that I've been meaning to give back to you for a long time now .
I'm feeling very low , and I need to sleep .
You've been competing with this king for my daughter .
Heart , for once be stronger than all the rest of the body combined .
All right , my lord. , How's the king doing ?
I'm sorry I hit you .
This hasn't reached the level of an Egyptian feast yet .
Poison never landed on such an ugly toad .
My lord , your noble subjects are looking for you all over the camp .
Your delicacies aren't worth as much to me as your welcome is .
Perform the speech just as I taught you , musically and smoothly .
Am I Dromio ?
I'll do anything you ask , monster , anything reasonable. , Come on , Trinculo , let's sing .
I'm glad .
I hope Antonio repays his loan on time , or he'll suffer for this .
My lord , what I say may be a little confused , since I'm half asleep and half awake .
Are you playing tricks on me by showing me savages and uncivilized men from the Indies , ha ?
It's dangerous to talk about it .
Don't simply hide your hatred .
I found it in my room , and Iago just confessed that he put it there for his own purposes .
If I were my father , cousin , would I do this ?
This is not the time for dwelling on personal grievances .
After you .
When I said that , I was angry too .
He said she was unfaithful ?
Cassio doesn't know you .
Are you with a Cornish company ?
Are you trying to sleep with him ?
A What's going on ?
That's how we'll do it , then .
Yes , my lord .
They will steal anything and call it spoils .
Are you that impatient ?
That's all there is to it .
I tell you , I'll either make him eat some part of this leek or give him a four-day head-bashing. , Go on , bite .
I'm sorry , you were saying ?
I'd never do such a bad thing , not for the whole world !
Now let the wind blow , waves swell , and ships sink !
And as for his dreams , I'm surprised he's so foolish as to trust the fantasies of a restless night .
If I could say hello to the fifth one as happily as I'll say goodbye to the first four , I'd be very happy he's coming .
Well , brighter lights always dim the smaller ones .
Now any effort ruins what it attempts .
Calm down .
He's very handsome .
My lord ?
Claudio !
It blesses the one who gives it and the one who receives it .
Good morning , Brutus .
Give him this letter .
No man born from a woman will ever defeat you." So get out of here , disloyal thanes , and join the weak and decadent English !
I just speak directly .
Now that's patience !
Is that a tradition ?
My lord , I informed them as much .
You are to bring his daughter to the supper .
If you have poison for me , I'll drink it .
Get yourself to a
But here comes Antony. , Welcome , Mark Antony .
Tell us when you wish to get married , and may God give you joy .
Give me your love instead , as I give you mine .
We will go in together .
Oh , I wish we could unmask scoundrels like that , and give a whip to every good man to beat them senseless with !
Not one drop sooner .
Help , dear lord , or the battle will be lost !
Is she really that wonderful ?
I would die of pity to see someone else in my condition .
Be quiet , people !
But if you believe everything they say , you won't be saved by half of what they do .
Can you smell out his secret now ?
Am I on earth , in heaven , or in hell ?
Tell me how .
Just listen a little more , and I'll bring you up to date about the present situation , which is the whole reason I'm telling you this story in the first place .
What do you say to a piece of beef with mustard ?
That's a nice hat you've got there .
Kind Tyrrel , will your news make me happy ?
Where is my gracious lord of Canterbury ?
But I do think it's the husband's fault if we wives cheat on them .
Do you want to destroy our old friendship by joining these men to insult your poor friend ?
But how strange that Beatrice should seem to know who I was and yet not know at the same time .
Hamlet , you're dead .
Delighted to stay ?
By my father's death , Your life has dishonored his death .
Should we see what he thinks ?
At least I don't have a horse for my mistress , or a saying so beside the point .
Foolish girl , in the eyes of most people this man's a Caliban , and compared to him , they're angels .
He says that for Brutus's sake he finds himself indebted to us all .
Here's my key .
What trade , boy ?
Farewell .
Who comes with him ?
It's getting there .
You are too expensive to wear every day .
Dido was from Carthage , not Tunis .
What , would you let a snake bite you twice ?
Where did he get wine ?
As long as heaven and nature extend it .
Get me out of here !
This is all that's left for me to do , but I won't do it .
But , my good lord , the words of you and Lord Buckingham are as trustworthy to me as if I had seen and heard him speak myself .
Come at me in the form of a rugged Russian bear , an armor-plated rhinoceros , or a tiger from Iran .
Your servants are waiting .
Then she was even more an angel , and you're an even blacker devil !
Please , tell Benedick about her feelings and see what he has to say .
But I guess it doesn't matter .
Only Adam , Rafe , and Gregory were ready .
Amen .
Canidius and the others that left Antony are given hospitality here but no positions of trust .
Why did he do that ?
Demand .
That's merciful but a bit careless .
Pardon me , lords and gentlemen who stayed awake .
Answer me straightforwardly .
Why should he have followed you ?
Go in , and don't cry .
I really believe your cousin was falsely accused .
Even if I had a whole bunch of mouths , I wouldn't be able to answer that .
You'll soon be meeting Lorenzo at supper ; he'll be a guest of your new master .
What's the news with you ?
We're two lions born on the same day in the same litter , and I'm the older and more terrible .
You're a poor man if you're this impatient !
Let quick sulfurous lightning , strong enough to split enormous trees , singe the white hair on my head .
How are you , your highness ?
Your stockings should be falling down around your ankles , your hat flying off your head , your sleeves unbuttoned , your shoes untied , and everything about you demonstrating carelessness and misery .
No , it would be better to speak first and kiss only after you've run out of things to say .
His military understanding is all theory , no practice .
Prison , my lord ?
That must be because you're so ambitious .
Play the music. , Take my hands , my queen , and we'll lull these people to sleep with our soft dancing .
These kneelings and humble courtesies might excite ordinary men , flattering them into turning Roman law into children's games .
I think so .
Yes , sir , I'm here .
Tie him up harder. , You filthy traitor !
What do you mean , "wears the wreath" ?
No .
But they are dead , and you killed them , you slave of the devil .
Would I dare do something like that ?
My sister would be much more offended to have her trusted messenger abused and assaulted just for carrying out her orders. , Put his legs in the stocks .
Come on , my dear Greek philosopher .
I am not treacherous .
But the really unbelievable thing is , and this is incredible , As most unbelievable things are .
I heard him groan , yes , I did , and the same tongue that ordered the Romans to obey him and transcribe his speeches in their books cried , "Give me some water , Titinius , " like a sick girl .
The sister of my wife , this lady here , is married to your son .
It'd be better to be delirious and unaware of anything .
But she's got to die , or she'll cheat on other men .
So you're saying you're not a whore ?
It wouldn't hurt you to be charitable .
I'd rather be a squawking bird than an animal like you .
Oh God , he's murdered his master !
Madam , keep up hope .
What brings him here ?
Ha !
Speaking for myself , and no offense to the general or anyone else , I hope I'm going to heaven .
It's not yet daylight .
No , he comes to be married Lady , do you come here to be married to this count ?
This is Cinna .
As God is my witness , you know you're mine .
I could do a great job with Hercules , or any other part that requires ranting and raving .
Dromio , tell the servants to prepare for lunch .
The crowd that follows Caesar at his heels , senators , justices , common petitioners , will suffocate a feeble man almost to death .
It's called the evil .
In that case you should sleep .
Yes , that was it .
Faint , fall down , if you don't , then you're lying about my eyes being murderers .
Sir , sir , that can't be true .
Tell us what happened today that put Caesar in such a serious mood .
But how can you say that , when the king himself says you're the heir to the Danish throne ?
If he's in a good mood I'll mention you again , and do everything I can .
That's exactly what I'll do , my love , and I hope you'll do the same .
If he looks serious , he must need money .
Good point , and well said .
Now , Roderigo , where did you see her ? , Oh , that miserable wretch ! , You say you saw her with the Moor ? , Oh , who would want to be a father ? , How did you know it was her ? , To think she tricked me so easily ! , What did she say to you ? , Get me more candles , and wake up all my relatives .
Mankind's role is to fear and tremble when the almighty gods send warning signals .
Or , if you don't mind , come to my home , and I'll wait for you .
I don't trust you .
He is an animal worthy of Perseus .
It usually only lasts about twenty seconds .
You wouldn't have dared , out of fear for your life .
Are they as popular as they used to be when I lived in the city ?
In the meantime , think about how I can do you good and give you what you want .
The duke's trumpets .
First , he sends his regards .
Help , help , oh , help !
Take these too .
She's not feeling well .
And mine say two hundred .
Look , here she comes .
But since your father doesn't want him to marry you , you have to consider Demetrius to be the better man .
I've never been taught how to make anything .
She can't even imagine what "love" is .
I'm being called .
Curse my father's ambition !
Life's better at
And when she speaks , doesn't her voice stir up passion ?
It's true , and he asked me to beg you both to attend .
Your doctors have expressly forbidden me to sleep with you , as there's a risk that you might have a relapse .
When devils are about to commit their biggest sins they put on their most heavenly faces , just like I'm doing now .
Something about Hamlet .
What ?
Take it back .
Call it a match !
And the boys are winning so far ?
Ah , soldier !
The king's in bed .
You've forgotten the will I told you about .
You should let others take care of you and submit to people who know better than you do what's good for you .
Big , round tears ran piteously down the animal's innocent nose .
Kneel , Romans , kneel , and let's wash our hands , up to the elbows , in Caesar's blood and smear it on our swords .
As for us , you know we are Antony's , and he is Caesar's .
You're the beautiful one as far as Demetrius is concerned .
I don't dare come down , forgive me , my lord , I don't dare , for fear of capture .
But men tend to interpret things however suits them and totally miss the actual meaning of the things themselves .
If he's caught the Benedick , he'll lose all his money before he's cured .
Drawing your sword on a woman ?
Ha !
Agreed .
I'm sorry to find you like this .
That's what made him crazy .
Call the messengers !
They say there are only five people on it .
Why , you scoundrel !
He is as full of courage as of kindness , princely in both .
This is like if I asked you to wear your gloves when it's cold outside , or eat nutritious food , or do something that's good for you .
I won't keep you very long .
A gullible father and a brother who's so innocent that he can't suspect anyone else of wanting to hurt him , these are the two fools I need for my plan to work .
But oh , poor Glou-cester !
Only my free will , nothing else .
This is a guy who's been praised for his honest bluntness , and who now insolently pretends to be plainspoken and twists the natural meanings of words .
We know what's appropriate for a watch .
Oh , Caesar !
And , if you need to , approach the subject of me : tell them that when my mother became pregnant with the insatiable Edward , my noble father was fighting in France .
Who ever saw the heavens threaten like this ?
Could you have found two Romans as good as these two ?
Please don't take what I said more seriously than it deserves to be taken .
Yes .
I've been singing ever since you made your daughters into your mothers by giving them all your power .
But tell me , Egeus .
I'm not a man who talks a lot , but I thank you .
I will allow you one day to look for help in Ephesus .
Tell her to put her mind at rest .
Come , sir , no more. , Oswald , come here !
Over there , where Titinius mourns it .
No , my lord .
It's like a monster that just grows and grows , out of nothing .
Good-bye .
On a night like this , young Lorenzo swore he loved her very much , stealing her heart with vows of love , but not one vow was true .
If you can't do it , be grateful you've lived this long and go wait to die in your cabin , if it comes to that. , Harder , men ! , Now get out of our way , I'm telling you .
But listen , Charmian .
My lord , the enemy has already passed the marsh .
You're stripped of your power and your command , and Cassio will govern Cyprus .
I was engaged to her before I ever met Hermia .
You just missed a fight that was barely avoided .
There was no Signior Montanto in our army .
That's good advice .
Where are those bastards ?
I'll also wear this in my cap .
I wish she were in heaven so she could appeal to some power to make this dog Jew change his mind .
I will go out .
You drank horses' urine and water from scum-covered puddles that even animals would refuse .
I meant to say the Lord Protector .
They steal hearts .
How are you ?
Revenge !
By God !
Renowned duke , please join us in the abbey , where we will discuss at length all that has happened to us .
Where's the cook ?
I go over hills and valleys , through bushes and thorns , over parks and fenced-in spaces , through water and fire .
Pish to you , you mangy dog , you pointy-eared Icelandic mutt .
The Constable of France .
He called her a whore so many times , and heaped up so much abuse on her that good people can't stand to hear it .
Oh , that devious Egyptian spirit !
Excuse me ?
A conclusion , a conclusion : he is in love .
I'll kill myself to save myself from slavery .
You're as pale as your nightgown !
Goodbye .
If your highness is willing , take revenge on him for that , because I know you're brave enough , I don't dare to , That's for sure .
Now they work for me .
I thank you for that quip , good Tranio .
Whenever a king sighs , everyone groans .
I think Alexander the Great was born in Macedon .
When beggars die there are no comets in the sky .
Oh , Caesar , read mine first , for my petition affects you more directly .
What prisoners of rank have been taken , uncle ?
Yes , by God , that it is .
I know she is a hateful , brawling scold .
Every person I meet greets me like an old friend , and every one of them knows my name .
Put
What good does heaven have in store that can do me any good now ?
Edmund , where's your wicked brother ?
Prepare the body , then , and follow us .
Come with me .
Yes , really .
On that point , our letters don't agree .
Now , what kind of entertainment do we have to fill up the long three hours between dinner and bedtime ?
My noble brother !
They should advance immediately , because I sense Octavius's side is a bit fainthearted right now , and a sudden push would overthrow him .
I wish she were in love with me instead .
Look , sir , I'm bleeding .
My falcon is now hungry and unfed and must not be given enough to eat until she comes to me , for if her hunger is satisfied , she'll pay no attention to the bait .
Whom you swore you would protect and defend .
Henry the Sixth , crowned king of France and England while still in his infancy , succeeded him .
The queen wants you to chat with Laertes , politely , before you begin your match .
Then why be jealous of a person like that ?
Where's your conscience now ?
Mark Antony , take Caesar's body .
And to you , good sir .
Yes sir , thank God .
I brought you here from Venice .
Oh , it breaks my heart to think how painful it must be for you to recall all this , things that I can't remember .
Listen to me .
Hurry up and get to your horse .
Will you do that for me , Silvius ?
It's not because I don't love you .
He was covered with blood from his helmet to his spurs .
You worthless man !
How about the mustard without the beef .
If he seems game to our plan , encourage him to join us and explain all our reasons .
I can't tell you anything else .
Do it well , and then leave us .
She was your boot-wearing mistress and your warrior lover , and now that she's getting married to Theseus , you've come to celebrate their marriage .
Look for him , Titinius , while I go to meet the noble Brutus and force him to hear this news .
Will you two help them get ready ?
I beg your
Hey , look over there !
And her cook yelled , mocked , and teased me , right ?
Follow her .
Clouds , dissolve into rain , so that I could say the gods themselves are weeping !
Won't you tell me who told you that ?
But what's your trade ?
Yes , I really think so .
Get it ready immediately .
Go back with her ?
That's the right answer , it shows your love .
Don't drive me crazy with curiosity , but tell me why your church-buried bones have burst out of their coffin , and why your tomb ,
Away , away , be gone .
I beg your pardon , sir , What did that guy say ?
Lysander I want to stop , but Hermia stops my heart from beating .
It persuades you and discourages you .
I'm not marvelous , sir , but I'm certainly a maiden .
What are you doing , old man ?
Poor Tom's chilly .
Be quick about it .
You bastards !
Oh , that's very nice !
Should we all give up and drown ?
Open your gates .
All right , Friar Francis , let's keep this short .
Better to have an extra servant on hand than be understaffed .
Let me gather my wits and get serious here .
As you were on land .
He's been gone for nine years and he's leaving again soon .
What , am I being denied death , as well ?
Babbling senselessly ?
Hero thinks Beatrice will surely die , for she says she'll die if he doesn't love her , and that she'll die before she tells him , and she'll die if he woos her and she's made to hold back even one of her usual insults .
Come , explain .
Their guilt is finally starting to gnaw at them , like a slow-acting poison .
Don't let us talk you into anything , but consider carefully the value of our offers .
Looking just like the dead king .
Your clothes aren't spattered with my family's blood , and you aren't affected by my curse .
I don't understand .
Where is that messenger ?
Let it all go .
When he stands where I am and sees you there .
Listen to me , you traitor .
Her sighs and tears are like great winds and floods .
If you really feel that way , then I hope you won't kill me .
Goodbye , my lord .
Good morning , gentlemen .
True .
That's how intense things like love are quickly destroyed .
Richard .
Thinking , my lord ? " My God , you keep repeating everything I say as if you were thinking something too horrible to say out loud .
Once at Sardis and once last night , here in Philippi fields .
I'll wait till his beard grows in , if you'll just hurry up and tell me what chin that beard is on .
We'll let you .
Oh , he's a dangerously clever boy , bold , quick-witted , capable .
You don't love me .
Where is Polonius ?
I am friends with you all and love you all , on one condition , that you prove to me that Caesar was dangerous .
A fox you've trapped And such a daughter Should both be slaughtered , If my fool's cap is worth a rope to bind them .
Love is such a violent emotion that it makes people self-destruct , as much as any strong emotion .
It's true , they're inconsistent .
Yes , and the best looking too .
I will pause for a reply .
And I will give you some more .
Can she give that away too ?
That's a lame threat from a toy gun , a poor individual's private displeasure with a monarch .
Give me your hand .
Come , come , I know what you're referring to , Richard .
Even my hair revolts .
Go ahead , then .
But Angelo , you'll pay for this , even if it costs all the precious metals in your jewelry shop .
You're a funny man , sir .
Messenger after messenger delivered news of your bravery to the king with praise for how you defended his country .
I've been poisoned .
So with no money , but a little more wisdom , I'm going back to Venice .
The Count Claudio will marry Leonato's daughter .
Hello there , sir !
Be gone !
Yes , we're the privates in her army .
Come , everyone .
Hello , Cassio !
I can get the better of religion and a few flimsy vows between a misguided barbarian and a depraved Venetian girl .
My dearest love , Duncan is coming here tonight .
I wouldn't either , by daylight .
No , ma'am .
I wouldn't change it except to make you think of me , my darling queen .
From the highest to the lowest of you , I bid you a hearty welcome .
That tree could be called God's tree , since it drops such wonderful fruit .
Good Ursula , go wake my cousin and ask her to get up .
Allow me to continue. , I am a gentleman of Verona , sir , who , hearing of your daughter's beauty and wit , her friendly disposition and bashful modesty , her uncommon virtues and her mild behavior , have taken the liberty of presenting myself as a guest at your house in the hope of seeing for myself if what I've heard is true .
I've felt neglected recently , but I decided that it was more likely that I was being hypersensitive than that they were intentionally unkind .
Wouldn't that have been just as appropriate ?
No , I'm sure it has , Volumnius .
Those island-bred skeletons , terrified for their bones , are an offensive sight on the morning field .
It doesn't matter .
Your logic is so foolish .
Instead , she puts flowers in the boy's hair and makes a fuss over him .
Look , you've got his wrinkled hands .
I'm here , my lord .
Oh , is that so ?
A bit of a hurry , my lord !
Jailer , watch out for this one .
How do you know he loves her ?
I'm killing myself with this provocative speculation.. .
Well , Syracusian , tell us-briefly-why you left your hometown and came to Ephesus .
Indeed I did , my lord .
It's best to rehearse there , because if we do it here in the city , we'll be bothered by crowds of people and everyone will know the plot of our play .
Only when they're dead can I start to count my gains .
Oh , sir , Don't think I'm flattering you .
But where's my fool ?
It would be better if they were all on his father's side , or that there were none at all on his father's side .
So the pale , angry moon , who controls the tides , fills the air with diseases .
Take good care of him .
Goodbye .
Now be quiet .
Villain , you don't know the laws of God or of man .
Whoo-hoo !
Three times in an hour I saw him down , and three times up again and fighting .
Good night , good boy .
As long as there are
Are you going to write Antony about this ?
I will not confess it to you nor to anyone else , because there was no one else to witness her speech .
Well , there they are .
What right did he have to scold me like that ?
Help !
I am not here to disprove what Brutus has said , but to say what I think there's a lot of sense in what he says .
How can I help you ?
Why shouldn't I be there in person ?
If only my prayers could inspire that kind of affection !
What man were you talking to at your window last night , between the hours of midnight and one ?
Now the only person I love , and believe in , and want to look at , is Helena .
But it was also prophesied that the crown would not go to your descendants , and that my sons and grandsons would be kings instead .
There's a similar mark on her arm .
If Cleopatra hears even a breath of this , she'll die immediately .
Because you're like the lowborn fellow who strikes the bell , you keep interrupting my thoughts .
If he fears God , he must necessarily keep the peace .
Oh , I only wish I knew the name of that husband you said he predicted will have a cheating wife !
The duke will agree with me on that .
My lady ordered me to deliver her letter .
Treat them with honor and dignity .
Wait , here's a penny to heal your head .
Quiet !
Even good men have bad luck .
Go to Francis Seacole , the constable of the watch .
Signior Leonato , listen to the friar's plan .
She'll be damned for it .
Come here , Catesby .
I'm sure I'll never get married in the way my sisters say they're married , loving their father only .
Well , thank you .
But do you mean what you're saying ?
It looks that way .
They have wings .
Oh , my good master !
You scoundrel !
I am satisfied , as long as the maiden cities you talk of come with her .
Where's the Master ?
The things men do daily , not knowing what they're doing !
We're glad to see you .
That's why your desires are wolfish , bloody , and ravenous .
Good sir , this ring was given to me by my wife .
I will catch up with you , Cleopatra , and weep for your forgiveness .
Not in the stocks , fool .
I wear it with pride , for I am Welsh you know , good countryman .
Show it !
Kinsmen , I hope the time is coming when people will be safe in their own bedrooms .
I know you .
One of your tears is worth everything that was won and lost .
You bring your cauldrons , your spells , your charms , and everything else .
If you send them word that you won't come , they might change their minds .
Have you written that letter to my sister yet ?
I loved this man so much it makes me weep .
He was in bed with , With her ?
I'll read it aloud .
Or like a whale .
Good morning , worthy Caesar .
I'm not moving an inch , pal .
Here he comes back .
A sculptor or a painter couldn't have screwed him up as bad as that , even as an apprentice .
There will be no lecture .
I'll stay in Messina until you're married , and then I'll go to Aragon .
So let me be brief here .
Do I mistreat even my enemies ?
But please tell me , who's his best friend ?
Shylock , although I never lend or borrow with interest , I'm willing to break that habit to help a friend in need .
It is .
We'll meet you at sea .
What time is it ?
I've had to acknowledge that he's my son so many times that now I can do it without embarrassment .
Before I fall asleep , I entrust my soul to you .
Bring him to me .
Lieutenant , I think you know I'm your friend .
Katherina , you may stay .
We'll answer .
It is that .
You hear the charges .
A little food and a huge welcome makes a joyous feast .
They'll kill us !
What's that ?
Who did it ?
Do as I asked you .
So then why should I offer this womanish defense that I'm innocent ?
We'll take care of it .
Neither ?
You're not asleep yet , sir ?
This is an asp's trail , and these fig leaves have slime on them , just like the kind that asps deposit on the caves by the Nile .
If you take more or less than exactly a pound , even if it's just the tiniest fraction of an ounce , if the scale changes by even so much as a hair , you die , and all your property will be confiscated .
Can you feel your legs ?
There isn't a single protrusion in the castle walls where these birds haven't built their hanging nests to sleep and breed .
It's true , Hero says so .
I'm neither , my lord .
Wasn't he here ?
Isn't my name Hero ?
Let's go , Menas .
What does that mean , sir ?
The things men are allowed to do !
And you have mercy on me too !
That's too long. , Servants , leave her and me alone .
Be quiet , boy , or you'll lose your mind .
A messenger from Lord Stanley .
I will be angry .
I'll be obedient and do all my tasks without complaining .
Sir , please , don't be angry .
Come , Grey .
Please forgive me , master .
No , no , the bell .
You opposed my taking part in the war .
Look at you getting all riled up !
Well sir , they've lied ; moreover , they have said things that were not true ; secondarily , they are slanderers ; sixth and lastly , they have falsely accused a lady ; thirdly , they have confirmed things that did not in fact happen ; and , in conclusion , they are lying scoundrels .
Me neither .
Sinful Macduff , they were killed because of you !
Everyone who can hear has heard about it .
What did your song mean , lady ?
Is it feasible ?
And if she starts to drop off , I'll rant and yell until I wake her up .
When I send for you , come out wearing masks .
I'm glad you're insane enough to admit it in front of me .
What do you have to say for yourself , Hermia ?
Something's wrong .
We'll burn Brutus's house .
Go after her , go .
I will , sir .
What's the difference ?
Do you know whom you're talking to ?
The violet smells to him the same as it does to me .
He will be fooled into thinking he is greater than fate , he will mock death , and he will think he is above wisdom , grace , and fear .
Give him room .
Draw your sword , scoundrel .
As for me , I welcome my good luck with sadness .
An illicit kiss !
Please let me go .
No , he refused it publicly , in open court .
I will mourn Hero tonight .
I don't expect Caesar and Antony will have a very friendly reunion .
Is this the work of an ambitious man ?
Regan , I hope you didn't know anything about that. , Ah , who's this ?
Please stop , sir .
I've separated them into groups around the island , just as you ordered .
I don't deny it .
When you've finished , go back to Pompey's theater .
You dog , you peasant !
What's the boy Malcolm ?
You'll live in luxury with Gremio .
Ha , ha , heard in Genoa .
Bardolph , be happy. , Nym , rouse your bragging spirits. , Boy , be brave .
That's no lie .
Why not ?
My gallant girls !
Why ,
Do you carry a pike ?
Is that the naked guy ?
Let's meet as little as we can .
I've finished it for you , and it ends in "Margaret." He's turned your curse against you , Margaret .
That's not necessary .
They're just fine , my dear madam .
Count how many times the clock chimes .
My love , call him back in here .
Looking toward England , we reminisced about the countless frightening experiences we'd had in the wars between the Yorks and the Lancasters .
As faithful as flies in rotting meat , which give birth to maggots every time the wind blows .
Yes , my lord .
I'm backed into a corner with nowhere to run .
I can only say this about her : if she looked different than she does , she would be ugly , and since she can't be anything but herself , I don't like her .
I always loved you .
What , is he dead ?
All cooped up together , just as you ordered , all imprisoned in the grove of linden trees that protects your room from bad weather .
Get away from me , witch ! " the fat woman cried .
But did you see them dead ?
Is that you , Diomedes ?
I have sent for the strawberries .
All right , I understand .
However your wit and luck allow .
In the high and mighty Roman Empire , just before the emperor Julius Caesar was assassinated , corpses rose out of their graves and ran through the streets of Rome speaking gibberish .
What's the matter ?
I'd like you to , see , because you don't like it , and because it isn't to your taste , and because it doesn't agree with you .
Who does it stand still for ?
What kind of life do you lead that your poor friends must beg for your company ?
Look , she's spotted him with those sweet eyes of hers .
May God be at your table .
Because he's so young , I've tried to discourage him , but he won't listen .
What's going on here , general ?
Let's see here .
I'd rather be a baboon than kill myself out of love for some woman I can't have .
I don't know what you mean by that , but I'm sure Caesar fell down .
This forest doesn't seem deserted when you're here , because you are all the world to me .
And you say he's not jealous ?
Oh , if you are the same Egeon , speak now , and speak to that same Emilia !
Because of your advice and your help , I have a high position now .
Ratcliffe , my lord , it's me .
But when our vices become habits , Oh , the sadness of it ! , the wise gods blind us , shade our better judgment , make us love our mistakes , and laugh as we strut to our ruin .
Come here , Tyrrel .
Yes , sir .
Agreed .
But I didn't want to be free like this .
I will advise him to speak as he usually does .
Don't talk to me , Emilia .
The more I pray , the less I get out of it .
Prove that the men you call your fathers did truly conceive you .
Start without me .
Look !
But could beauty be related to anything better than goodness ?
I've botched the job , friends .
The town is besieged , and the trumpet calls us to the gap , and we talk and do nothing , by Christ .
A snail ?
That's a deal .
Quiet now !
My lord , he asks that you please visit him tomorrow or the next day .
I'm off to visit my friends in Padua , particularly my best friend Hortensio .
No , our general's infatuation is out of control .
Which ones are the malefactors ?
I am his brother , and I love him very much .
No , my cousin , don't wish that even one man who is now in England were here instead .
You have enough holy feeling to advise me to "make peace with God , " but you're willing to go to war with God by murdering me ?
Are you talking about Caesar ?
I wish you'd be patient .
Goneril , are you coming with us ?
And I'm her father as well .
If I weren't a merciful man , I'd forget about your missing brother and punish you in his place .
Uncle of Exeter , release the man who was arrested yesterday for railing against me .
What's this ?
At other times , I know what's what .
I found this pinned to my tent this morning .
I'm going on alone .
Do not , Phoebe .
Yes , I'm sure he will , to stay with you .
It was about to say something when the rooster crowed .
Anyone who builds his hopes on air lives like a drunken sailor hanging on a mast , ready with every dizzy nod of his head to tumble to the bottom of the sea .
We'll look for new friends and keep the company of strangers .
But since I've gotten myself involved this far , because I'm so stupidly honest and because I like you so much , I'll keep going .
Take pity on Poor Tom , who is persecuted by the devil .
Get up early tomorrow , at the sound of the lark , noble Norfolk .
Carry him to my best room , gently , so he doesn't wake , and hang all my erotic paintings around him .
It's true , I confess .
Welcome .
Good lord !
Can I have a word with you , Lucillius ?
I can't wait to hear him call the drunkard "husband , " and to watch my men smother their laughter as they pay their respects to this simple peasant .
So , in the name of God and all the good that will come of this
Really , young men , though it wasn't a very hard song to get right , the music was still all out of tune .
We'll cool the mixture with baboon blood .
Who were you chasing with your sword ?
We were about to have our noses snapped off by two old men with no teeth .
My reputation , my reputation !
I'll do so .
I've only done my duty .
Your friends at Pomfret , they're the ones who need a priest .
Let me ask you a particular question .
You'll work for me .
The hour of death is approaching .
Do you know him ?
When was the last time you saw her sleepwalking ?
Make yourself comfortable .
What's wrong ?
Oh , what evil !
I wish my daughter were dead at my feet wearing those jewels !
Please put up with my weakness .
I'd like to get to know you better , Mr. Cobweb .
Look at my face .
Oh , no , good gentleman !
But everything that lives is mortal , including the foolishness of love .
Watch me : stroke your chins and swear by your beards that I am a knave .
So tell me , Grumio , how goes the world ?
I can suck sadness out of a song the way a weasel sucks eggs .
He feels the need to grace all his other tramps with his presence while I sit at home starving for a smile from him .
Weren't you banished on pain of death ?
The only possible interest I could take in you would be to hit you on the head with a stool , paint your face with blood , and make a fool out of you .
It's dinnertime , my lord .
You once stole my position ; now you get to have the grief that goes with it .
Hear everyone's opinion , but reserve your judgment .
The reason I think he's insane , besides the way he just acted , is that he told a senseless story over lunch about being locked out of his own house .
Please take them off .
Then there's the Count Palatine .
Show us the way .
Yes , good idea ; that's the
I hope so .
You should ask me what time of day it is , instead .
Octavia has a pious , chaste , meek disposition .
The mayor is here at hand .
I have no doubt that it will be a swift and successful war , since God so graciously exposed this dangerous plot .
Therefore , accept my everlasting farewell .
But you're no such man .
You will be an accessory to both crimes .
I need better evidence than the ghost to work with .
Snakes shed their skin there , and the shed skin is wide enough to wrap a fairy in .
What's up , mister ?
I feel this pinprick .
We're strangers here .
Well then , if I've ever thanked a man , I'll thank you now .
Then what's Antony ?
Is that the man you want ?
Why are you defying me in this urgent matter ?
Pull off my beard ?
Has it come to this ?
The king is not responsible for it .
Is Othello angry ?
Go find the traitor Gloucester .
What are you accused of ?
Signior Benedick !
Today our hopes are at an end .
How do you feel ?
I thumb my nose at superstitions .
There are women like that out there , no question .
If you don't need it for some important reason , then give it back to me .
My husband is dead .
Caesar wouldn't take the crown .
I did that to him .
I'll bet any man who knows the law five shillings to one on it .
God willing , our love and our happiness will only increase as we get older .
Will you come with me ?
Then let God grant me that you'll be damned for that wicked deed .
No , my lord , unless I could have another husband for the work week .
Why did you send me out , brave Cassius ?
It's often the case that having something makes us spoiled , while not having it turns out to be advantageous .
God bless your Grace with health and happy days .
I know where she is and , if you don't mind , I will set her before you tomorrow , whole and unharmed .
I'll follow .
Who do you think ?
You may hear about it soon .
Do you remember a Venetian scholar and soldier who accompanied the marquess of Montferrat here once when your father was still alive ?
Go .
Come on !
I would have sworn that , too , my lord , especially against Benedick .
All the worse that she stooped this low , then .
But even so , I'll make doubly sure .
He'll go back to his Egyptian dish .
Even though it's early , there are already a thousand armored soldiers waiting for you at the harbor .
No , we'll sneak away at supper time , disguise ourselves with masks at my house , and come back in an hour .
Yes , but that makes me love you even more .
But I thank God that I failed in my scheme , and I rejoice in paying the penalty , as I beg God and you to pardon me .
The noise is coming from over there .
Go and tell them this .
I don't have anywhere to go , so I don't need to see .
Good Lord , what a clown you are !
To answer your question , ma'am , yes , he was friendly with those knights .
There was a kind of war in my brain that wouldn't let me sleep .
Who's there ?
I was told that by one who knows him better than you .
I was his daughter when you banished him .
Ha , ha , ha !
There isn't any other way , unless you took on another form and became someone else .
Are you rich ?
I've heard all about you women and your cosmetics too .
No , my dear cousin .
I'm your neighbor and came courting first .
Come and get it !
Please , let me go .
Don't you know he has ?
When she cries , all the little flowers cry too .
Passionate" ?
Dromio ?
Be quiet , Signior Gremio .
Give me your hand , Messala .
I'll say good-bye now .
I'm glad to see you .
I wish my father could see them with my eyes .
Silly babbler , how you talk !
Ma'am , you wouldn't treat me like this if I were your father's dog .
But I'll marry you under different circumstances , with extravagant festivals , public festivities , and celebration .
Le Roy ?
For besides the good news , we are also celebrating his marriage .
Just as the ox has his yoke , the horse its bridle , the falcon a tether , a man has his desires , to keep in check .
Keep an eye on her , Moor .
Did you think I was talking about sex ?
There are no bushes or shrubs to protect me from the weather here .
And there's nothing I can do about it .
Did they make you the messenger ?
I know the boy will be a convincing gentlewoman , taking up her exact walk and talk and gentle gestures .
I eat the air , like chameleons do .
Coward !
Well , let's hope you stay in that noble frame of mind .
I'm not going to eat dinner tonight .
Please , father , since you're weak , act like it .
Swear by my sword .
Is she dead , then ?
I think so .
Follow his chariot , like the greatest disgrace to your whole gender .
What do you think about this change ?
Gracious Lord , blunt the swords of those traitors who mean to tear poor England apart again !
Kiss him for that , good widow .
I hope to see good days , and many of them .
Can a person be forgiven and still keep the fruits of his crime ?
I grow old , and all dignity has been thrashed out of me .
I've brought him a present .
I'll send my prayers with him .
My name's Stephano , and I've come to tell you my mistress will arrive here at Belmont before sunrise .
But I won't shed any of her blood or scar that beautiful skin , whiter than snow and smooth as the finest marble .
Get lost !
Tranio got you that time .
Besides , our hands are hard and calloused .
Beware of March 15th .
No , a whole share for me .
Go to bed , and sleep .
A crow without feathers ?
It's time for us to stand guard .
And all my children ?
I came here crying .
Damn it , shut your mouth .
In Alexandria he condemned Rome , and that's not all .
I'm at your service , madam .
Is all of this about your father ?
Listen to me , Beatrice , Talking with a man outside her bedroom window !
All right then , back home we go .
of patience .
Please , pretty young man , I'd like to get to know you better .
I beg your pardon .
Oh , sweet England !
How can a tailor make a person ?
How ?
You mean , to bear me , not to bear My protector , Richard , insists on it .
Is there anything else I can do for you ?
No , my lord .
I'll go back to the duke of Gloucester and tell him so .
Why "puppet" ? , Oh , I see where this is going .
Yeah , right , go get him .
No braver than this ?
He saved me the trouble : here he comes .
Hear me , you wrangling pirates .
No , gentle madam .
You don't want to eat , sir ?
You can't find that out , even if you held my heart in your hand you couldn't make me tell you .
So , I agree with noble Buckingham , only a few should go to meet the prince .
The demon Hoppedance is in Tom's belly , crying for some fish to eat .
We'll speak again tomorrow .
What would you like , sir ?
I won't leave him alone until he gives Cassio his job back. , How are you , my lord ?
But how would you praise a truly good woman , someone who had no reason to worry about what anyone said about her ?
That island of England breeds very valiant creatures .
I hope you're strong enough to do it .
Take your time .
Then we'll be stuffed with news .
Your wife , Fulvia , mustered her army first .
At this time of night ?
But let's follow it , and then do our dirty work afterward .
Not really , for the truest poetry is often the most artificial .
I want to forget what I am .
On what grounds ?
She gave up her life with your name still within her .
Shall I put it plainly ?
What , don't courtiers ' hands sweat ?
How did you get better ?
Stay there and fortify it well against the French .
I hate him so much it makes me sick , and whoever can ruin his happiness will make me happy .
But truly , if I were as
If you forgive us , we'll make everything all right .
Here in the tent .
I'm going to tell Desdemona my feelings .
Oh , the poor bird .
Yes , you would beg , if you were in my position .
Not for Cadwallader and all his goats .
Please don't tell me any more .
My lady , should I lie in your lap ?
Now , you tell me : should I feel loyal to the Moor ?
Very much so .
Yes , Petruchio .
How clever of you .
Never , Iago .
When you were wooing Desdemona , did Michael Cassio know about it ?
Caesar hanged him for this service .
That will tell you a lot .
A two-hundred-year-old witch sewed it while she was in a fevered trance .
The partygoers have arrived .
No , come to my cabin .
Agincourt .
He has brought you figs .
You should mock me I wish I were invisible , so I could grab that strong fellow by the leg .
I will see you tomorrow , then .
The demon who seduced you could stride the world over with the proud gait of a lion , could return to hell and tell the devil's legions , "I will never win another soul as easily as I won that Englishman's." How you have poisoned my faith in people !
This is the prophecy that the wizard
Stay , lovely Helena .
Go !
Oh , will you leave me alone in the dark ?
Yes , my lord .
He is my dear friend , your Majesty .
Oh , control yourself , lady !
Go then , goodbye .
See the wound that Casca made .
Oh , don't touch me .
Your children will be kings .
If she is silent and won't speak at all , I'll praise her chattiness and say she speaks with piercing eloquence .
Are you sure we're awake ?
Not for your entire fairy kingdom. , Come , fairies , let's go .
With a touch of green in it .
That's what I conceive of him .
Then he says I didn't return some ships he loaned me .
I want my bond .
I thank you very much on his behalf .
As I remember , Henry the Sixth prophesied that Richmond would be king when Richmond was only a foolish little boy .
It's about who I am , and how , why , and where this handkerchief was stained .
I'm the one , Hamlet .
Good-bye for a while .
Aren't the others waiting for me , Cinna ?
Finally the new moon , curved like a silver bow in the sky , will look down on our wedding celebration .
Moors are moody people. , So sell your lands and raise a lot of cash .
Not true , not true .
Go to your cabins and be quiet !
Please , sir , restrain yourself .
Royal seductress !
Wake up , wake up !
By Hercules , I think I'm right .
I'm going to find some shade and sigh until he returns .
There's nothing like good hay , really sweet hay .
Remember the reward we're getting when the deed's done .
It's your presence that draws out this blood from his empty veins .
They're well too .
Did you notice how the queen's guilty relatives turned pale when they heard about Clarence's death ?
That's true .
I'll go with you , my lord , if you'll allow me .
Look , here she comes , with your ungovernable wives in tow , like prisoners of her womanly persuasion. , Katherine , that cap of yours doesn't look good on you .
Good friends , I thank you all for coming to see me wed this patient , sweet , virtuous wife .
They were poisoned , then .
Is that chain you're wearing the one you promised to give to me ?
Madam , if I do as well as I think I'm going to do in these dangerous , violent wars , you and your relatives will have more good at my hands than you've ever had bad !
This is just a trifling matter here , sir .
There , my lord .
Why , what do you imagine his name to be ?
I recognize something about that voice .
I have responsibilities in this war , and as the absolute ruler of my kingdom I will carry out my duties as if I were a man .
Ha !
Today I'm going to get what I said I wished would happen to me if I was ever false to King Edward's children or his wife's allies .
Or am I asleep now and imagining all this ?
I'm sure he's been kidnapped .
The father and the master and the king didn't order their subordinates ' deaths when they ordered their services .
Not us .
By that kind of logic , I should hate Orlando , since my father hates his father .
Meet me at the synagogue .
You're right , actually .
Dear woman , you don't know the rules of charity .
The wind blew down through the chimneys where we were sleeping .
Am I your servant ?
Do you want to know what I wrote ?
I can't put my feelings into verse , but please believe I love you best , oh , best of all .
Go on .
I'm tired and feeling heavy , but I can't sleep .
Did you hear the news that's going around ?
She told my mother that as long as she kept it with her , my father would love and desire her .
Understand ?
You speak like a very thankful and respectful boy , and may God bless you .
Yes , kind sister .
I know your position .
Well , I'll turn pimp and do some occasional pickpocketing .
We'll put a leash on this danger that's now running wild .
Oh , ho !
Raise all the money you can .
He's gone , and his wife's dead .
Let me love him because he deserves it , and you can love him because I do .
Very well .
They would like me to be as familiar with men's pockets as their gloves and handkerchiefs , which goes against my manhood , because to take something from another's pocket and put it into my own is plain stealing .
If your wife's not a madwoman , and you tell her how much I deserve this ring , she won't stay angry at you forever if you give it to me .
If we meet him at Philippi , these people will be at our backs .
Go to the harbor immediately !
Francis Flute , the bellows-repairman ?
Well , the point is , he's lost a ship .
My name is Edgar , and I'm your father's son .
Should we go inside ?
Nine or ten times I wanted to stab him under the ribs .
And is "pig" not the same as "great , " may I ask ?
Why didn't the jerk come back to me when I called him ?
I'm telling you , get out of here , and don't follow me around like this .
Good !
Alas , my lord , your confidence is getting the better of your wisdom .
Hearts can not think it , tongues can not speak it , meas-urements can not calculate it , scribes can not write it , bards can not sing it , and poets can not make verses about it .
The son ran away .
So here's the plan .
At my house .
Octavius , I'm older than you are .
Only too well .
When should the three of us meet again ?
No , what provoked you was your own bloody mind , which never thinks about anything but butchering .
Richard , a fiendish spy for hell itself , still lives , but only long enough to buy souls to send below .
If the duke and his court agree to set aside the fine for one half of his property , I'm happy , as long as he lets me have the other half in trust , to give it to the gentleman who recently stole his daughter .
I will find the time to cry for you , Cassius , I'll find the time .
They tell me he died well , and settled his scores .
On land you keep the legions and cavalry together , don't you ?
It's a wild night .
Tell me .
Oh , you prophesied that the time would come when I would want your help in cursing that humpbacked spider , that hideous toad !
But I don't hate Orlando .
Kill !
No , but the barber's assistant has been seen with him .
But that's another story .
You will love more than you are loved .
You may do whatever you want in the world .
Not many , and no one important .
Two or three men are groaning .
Here , take away the dish .
Hortensio , good friends like us can get by on a few words .
I must go report what happened .
Good evening to your Worship , good Captain James .
Let the gods judge me !
The thing is definitely going to be sold .
You were one of his favorites .
In exchange for the blood I shed for you then , I ask you for justice now .
God , I'm really sick .
Oh , sirs , if I stirred your hearts and minds to mutiny and rage , I would offend Brutus and Cassius , who , you all know , are honorable men .
I can't ask you to make my daughter live , that's impossible , but I beg you both to tell the people of Messina that she was innocent when she died .
Bring me his answers quickly .
Don't you hear me speaking ?
Quiet , there !
A basting .
No , Orlando , men are like April when they're wooing a girl , young , and passionate , but like December once they're married and their passions have cooled .
He pretended to be some kind of sorcerer , and he gazed in my eyes and took my pulse .
I accept your devotion with my deepest love .
Oh , life is full of surprises !
Let's carry him in triumph to his house !
The last time I was in Exeter , the mayor kindly showed me the castle there and called it " My lord !
It's nothing .
Is Scotland the same as when I left it ?
The door is open , sir .
You're mistaken .
I don't know who had him arrested , but the man that arrested him was in a suit of leather .
Here , you there , Grumio .
I'm learning every hour how to be subservient .
It is three o'clock , and , Romans , before night , we will try our luck in a second battle .
You always slip out of the argument like this .
I'm your master , Dromio .
Don't push him too far .
You don't have more than half an hour to live .
Oh , really ?
So be cheerful .
It used to be the last ditch comfort of miserable people .
It has no fighting spirit .
Don't spoil the justness and virtue of our endeavor nor weaken our own irrepressible spirits by thinking that we need a binding oath , when the blood that every noble Roman contains within him would be proven bastard's blood if he broke the smallest part of any promise he had made .
And what's the point , sir ?
Your old age and the prospect of death are making you imagine things .
Stand away from the hearse .
Don't give him time to catch his breath .
You didn't arrive like Caesar's sister .
I'll go hunting again tomorrow , I think .
A daughter ?
You're as wise as you are beautiful .
Take it to heart , Dorset .
I think that our father will leave here tonight .
My God , that's my handkerchief !
When I work it over with magic spells , the drop will produce magical spirits that will trick Macbeth with illusions .
Welcome .
I'd be as right for the job as you are , and I'd do it more easily , since I'd have good will on my side .
Is this the same Moor whom the senate considers so capable ?
I humbly thank you .
I think so too .
And here's another poem , which I stole from my cousin's pocket , in her handwriting and all about her adoration for Benedick .
Now he's a little crooked .
There are more things in heaven and earth , Horatio , than you've even dreamed of .
As moral as me !
I should backtrack and begin with how my master , Don John , arranged for the Prince , Claudio , and himself to witness this friendly encounter from the orchard .
Wake up !
Then I salute you with this royal title : long live Richard , England's worthy king !
How did you know what happened to your poor father ?
Oh , shut up !
Why , the man who shortens his life by twenty years cuts off twenty years of worrying about death .
Good-bye , noble Agrippa .
I beg you to tell me your name so I can use it in my prayers .
Gonzalo is a miracle-worker .
Let me unbutton this .
And even if you throw everything you possess to the two of them , they'll battle each other to the death to have it all .
Lock yourself in and send him word that you're dead .
This is Trebonius .
God protect you from them and from other false friends !
Exactly right .
Isn't he here ?
Wholeheartedly , good young man .
He's a proper count , that Count Sugarplum , a sweet gentleman , for sure !
This is the end of my journey , the end of my life .
My meaning And I
So , so , so , so !
This is Decius Brutus .
And time itself is ended .
God bless you , Bottom , God bless you .
Well , I'm not sorry to hear that , because they have always been my enemies .
I wish you could tell him I saved his brother .
I'll lie down here and measure out my grave .
Leave all the rest to me .
He refuses , as he is free of vanity and self-serving pride and ascribes all the glory and responsibility for victory to God .
And let me kill Cassio .
Yes , yes .
Good morning to my sovereign king and queen .
I doubt it .
And I feel that I love her .
I don't know how to ask you for forgiveness , but I have to say something .
Come , driver !
In every good thing they do .
It's the same kind of guy who got you upset and made you suspect I'd cheated on you with the Moor .
He is the general challenger .
If I find an opportunity , I will give him a piece of my mind .
I see you don't intend to part with her , or perhaps you don't like my company .
You can decide that privately .
Then Octavia's complaints will rouse Caesar , and as I said before , the thing that brought them together will part them .
Help , my lord of Norfolk , help , help !
Look out , I'm on my way up .
I almost feel you .
How else is he the "man in the moon" ?
Why , sweet Othello , I haven't done anything to deserve this !
I don't know , sir .
They're retreating , sir , and our superiority indicates a clear victory .
Daughters who can make you obey them .
I spoke angry , foul words to him , and with that I will kiss you .
You'd be a pitiful bird .
My husband ?
The Prince and Claudio are hurrying this way .
You won it .
I'm afraid he'll punish me .
Please , corporal , stop !
Give me your hand .
Why , because we're always handling our ewes , and their fleece , as you know , is greasy .
I regret my crime more than my death , and I beg your Highness to forgive me , while punishing my body with death .
The king is coming .
Young man , your father's dead .
Antony would easily outshine all imaginary beings .
I'll listen to Brutus .
It's time to reassess the situation .
No , no , with God's help , his son will be king .
But his ambition , for that , I killed him .
I know , prince .
What have you done ?
Please go on .
What , from myself ?
What , there's going to be a masquerade ?
We beg you , for your own sake , to respect your safety and give up .
Right now I'm away from home and I can't provide you with proper care .
Take good care of him .
Where's the Master , Boatswain ?
As for Antony , I'm not interested in his requests .
You love me in spite of your heart , I think .
You may as well undertake to be hanged .
Take it away .
Were his wounds on his front side ?
That Don John had given him a thousand pieces of gold for wrongfully accusing the Lady Hero .
Yes , my lord .
Because , my good king , England is so poorly led , her scepter so foolishly borne by a vain , silly , shallow , impulsive youth , that she's hardly a threat .
There is nothing in the world that I love as much as you .
You must know that the snake will act according to his nature .
One of you run to the Queen with the news .
You told me to do the same , my liege .
Oh , to hell with those people !
The British forces are on their way here .
He's given his empire to a whore , and now they're gathering kings to wage a war .
Is there a murderer here ?
He's lying dead in a ditch , with twenty deep gashes in his head , any one of which would have been enough to kill him .
Come on , Desdemona , I've only got an hour of love to spend with you , to tell you what you need to do .
Everyone can see that , and even blind men can smell the stench of his misery now .
Stop right there !
I could do it myself .
I've seen her claim to be dying twenty times before , and for far less reason .
It's time for me to go .
Oh , then you never loved as wholeheartedly as me .
Noble Buckingham , your promise is like medicine to my ailing heart .
Ha , ha , ha !
Did I do anything good to myself ?
Who's this ?
It's a very pleasing night to honest men .
He is taking care of it as we speak .
The gown was made just as my master was directed .
I kiss his dirty shoe , and from the bottom of my heart I love the lovely boy .
Your vote will be as strong as anyone's in the reordering of the government .
But do you really think the Prince would treat you that way ?
She mocks all her suitors so severely that they drop the suit .
Goodbye , my lord .
She's crying .
Was Queen Cordelia aggrieved by the letters you delivered ?
I do dare , and I say that you are the villain .
Come on , brother !
Indeed , you would be out if I were your mistress , if my chastity is worth as much as my wit .
I swear I do .
He goes forth to war bravely .
Then your other senses must be getting worse because of the trauma of blindness .
We'll hurry .
I've stayed up with you for two nights now , and I haven't seen any evidence of what you were talking about .
The enemy gets larger each day .
Let's be light-hearted .
Oh , it's a disaster , a disaster , by this hand , it's a disaster .
It's a shame that we eagles are caged up while the vultures are free to do whatever they please .
Suffolk died first , and York , cut to pieces , came to him where he lay in his blood and took him by the face , kissing his gashes .
Trust me , you could slide all the way from my shoulder to my heel taking no more of a running start than the distance between my head and my neck .
This king is a branch of that same victorious stock .
Cupid , that blind bastard son of Venus , conceived from a thought and anger , born from insanity , that blind , naughty boy who makes everyone else go blind just because he can't see himself , let Cupid judge how deep my love runs .
I know him ; he wears a lock of hair .
Please , educate me .
Let thunder rumble !
When we meet on Judgment Day , that look of yours will send me from heaven to hell , where devils will grab me .
I want to use this money to set my father free .
I don't believe it .
I know a lady in Venice who'd walk all the way to Palestine for a kiss from him .
The man who brought my answer to you was a fool .
If she feels like coming over here , I'll give her your message .
It's true .
Neither death nor life will stop me from coming .
Let us leave everything and give our vineyards to the barbarous nation .
I wish he'd go away !
How could he be in debt without me knowing it ?
Macduff is missing , and so is your noble son .
Robin Starveling , you're going to play Thisbe's mother. , Tom Snout , the handyman .
So go ahead and have your terrifying fun .
The one the Moor gave to Desdemona , which you asked me to steal so many times .
May heaven save us from indecent thoughts !
In the fact that it's solitary , I enjoy it very much ; but in the sense that it's private , it's terrible .
Whenever he talks about her he can't stop laughing .
What's this all about ?
I wonder if the lion's going to talk .
I mean knock his brains out , so he can't take Othello's place .
Yes , my lord .
It came from a neutral party , not from someone opposed to you .
We have consented to all reasonable terms .
I hope he's grown a lot since I last saw him .
More , please , more .
Good luck .
But now I see our weapons are like straws , our strength like a straw's weakness , and our weakness past comparison , so that we seem to be the thing we most are not .
You interpret my words in a melancholy sense , my hearty friends .
Treat Desdemona well .
What would you like me to do ?
You may think that I don't love you .
Tranio , let's go .
Say what you're here for .
Now please go in .
He's not here .
Brutus , do not provoke me .
How's it going , Shylock ?
It's something , it's nothing : it's yours , it's mine , and it'll belong to thousands more .
I'm sure he's out there dancing .
A hundred then .
I hope not .
Do you want to hear what she says ?
What a painful condition responsibility is .
I'm your love , no matter what you think .
Let me see what he looks like , so when I see another man who resembles him , I'll know to avoid him .
Come on , let me wipe your face .
I don't have it with me .
You won't be striking me down , but defeating Caesar .
In bed with her ?
It is .
That's what I'm afraid of .
I have lived long enough .
As for me , I'm surrendering all my power over to him , giving him absolute authority for the rest of his life .
Do I look as pale as everyone else does , Lord Dorset ?
You'll get a blow from me for that , I think .
Love can make worthless things beautiful .
When they see the face of Caesar , they will vanish .
Would you like some more sauce to go with it ?
Come on , sir , will you come aboard ?
So I suppose your grace can truly say that I have lost it .
What are you Nothing .
I'll give the Queen a hearing and grant her requests if she either throws her dishonored friend out of Egypt or kills him .
So long .
You'll do no such thing .
It isn't good for your health to expose your weak body to the raw , cold morning .
Oh , you're sticking a dagger in me !
You're lying , you shaggy-haired villain !
We seemed to have two separate bodies , but we had one heart .
If you complain any more , I'll split an oak tree and lock you up in it till you've howled for twelve years .
No , I don't want to send your soul to hell when I kill you .
Leave me , my friend .
What did he do that made him flee this land ?
Add to these eight thousand four hundred knights , squires , and brave gentlemen , five hundred of whom were given the title of knight only yesterday .
If your Grace would kindly appoint some members of your council to sit with me once more and go over them more carefully , I will give my answer and acceptance right away .
The old priest at Saint Luke's Church is at your command at all hours .
I know how Too light for a lout like you to catch , though no lighter than I should be .
That's why the King of France listened to my pleas and tears .
That's why you sleep so soundly .
Oh , noble weakness !
It's gone .
Send something along to prove you're withdrawing the orders .
Hear me out , my lord .
In order to make your company even more enjoyable , I'm going to keep to myself until suppertime .
Amen .
Tear him apart , tear him up !
A crazy bastard .
With him out of Venice , I can make whatever bargains I want when I lend money. , Go , Tubal .
But go on .
But you're all wound up about fashion , too .
You can figure out the rest .
Stay inside .
Do you know Fluellen ?
Why , good sir ?
A Roman .
Don't just swear by it ; put your hand to some use that will prove you love me .
I'll bet you a hundred marks , my Kate puts her flat on her back .
Get out !
The king ?
Not with any sauce they could provide for them .
Oh , let us be merciful anyway .
She speaks my language !
I know that Regan will taste just like Goneril , both of them sour crabapples .
Friends of this country .
Those trumpets are calling us in to dinner .
At least two hours past .
So you want to put a man in your belly .
Since you're letting me leave , I'll hurry .
Who should hang them ?
There's very little about her that's gloomy , my lord .
What's the news , brave soldier ?
Talkers aren't good doers .
You won't find any cause for anxiety , even if you look for one .
Good grief , do you think that just because I'm dressed like a man , I have a man's patience ?
All this so suddenly ? , Edmund , what's going on ?
Your case is better than that .
So take for life a fellow of pure and plain faithfulness .
Oh , grief has transformed me since the last time you saw me .
Oh God !
Farewell till then .
Hide with a false pleasant face what you know in your false , evil heart .
Everything about this is unnatural !
Petruchio ?
Are you begging , brother ?
I've lurked in the shadows here to watch the downfall of my enemies .
Who's dead ?
Just go after him and watch what he does next .
This treacherous Egyptian has betrayed me .
It's a play about ten words long , which is the shortest play I've ever heard of .
You've killed an innocent woman , and you're going to pay dearly for her death .
Those of you who are young and active , I beg you to follow them and keep them from doing the crazy things their guilt might push them to do .
Don't you agree that we owe it to him to tell him about this , out of duty and love ?
Smile , then , on this beautiful union .
Malcolm and Donalbain , the king's two sons , have run away and fled , which makes them the prime suspects .
You're right , I'll go quietly .
Rome has lost the ability to raise noble men !
Lord Gloucester has helped him leave .
You say you're a better soldier .
Sir , my brother is very fond of you .
Your sister's the better soldier of the two .
Skip over all the particularities between then and Harry's return to France .
Killing him once is not enough revenge .
Good Enobarbus , consider yourself my guest as long as you're here .
These recent eclipses of the sun and moon don't bode well for us .
They are , my lord .
I want you to live , since to me , death is happiness .
Don't .
He is .
I'm your evil spirit , Brutus .
The meat was fine if you wanted to eat it .
No .
Farewell , King .
What , I'm a prisoner ?
Good night , good night .
I'll stay , my lord .
I wish they had stayed !
If you say that , you'll only be telling the truth .
It's impossible .
I prefer to call it a "hanger." But anyway .
If I may say so , your Majesty , your famous grandfather and your great-uncle Edward , the Black Prince of Wales , or so I've read in the history books , fought a very brave battle here in France .
I didn't realize he knew her .
Hurry up .
From under the earth .
I played Julius Caesar .
And what is the subject ?
Why would you be so foolish as to beat the moody duke's favorite champion ?
I don't know , except they are busy with some phony guarantee .
And now it looks like you need my help .
We would not want to die in the company of a man who fears to die with us .
It's his fault that he's all worked up like this .
Hurry to a convent .
No , my lord .
Then tell her my loving story in simple terms .
Until I know for sure , I'll humor her .
What name , madam ?
There ! , And over there ! , And over there !
Oh , what a villain !
Will your Majesty grant us permission to freely express the message we've been asked to convey ?
I'll lock up the doors , grab some more ducats , and be with you right away .
Lysander , say something !
Then think about how shameful it would be for you to give in to his seductive talk and surrender your treasure chest to his greedy hands .
Everyone keeps yelling , "Here they come ! " Our castle is strong enough to laugh off their seige .
You'll become a wood salesman and buy nothing but clubs from me .
What were the primary evils he claimed women were guilty of ?
A very candid reply .
That was too much .
If I gave them all I own , I'd have two fool's caps for myself .
You're the one I have to obey .
Do tell .
Listen Tranio !
Oh yes , I heard them all , and more , too .
Get out of here , you blathering peasant !
Where is he , in his bed ?
I tell you , Captain , if you look at a map of the world , I'll bet you will find , comparing Macedon and Monmouth , that the situations , see , are very similar .
If you married my sister for her wealth , then for her wealth's sake , treat her with more kindness .
Where is he now ?
You imply that married men are fools .
Have I done something to offend you without knowing it ?
But if I gave my wife a handkerchief , Then what ?
Here it is .
Here comes the owner of one piece .
Which troupe is it ?
I'd rather get a husband from your father .
Good monster !
Well , the poor man died by your first order , which was carried by a winged messenger .
I will , Caesar .
They were paid to betray their master .
One of you go find the forest ranger .
Not much .
Master , is this Satan's mistress ?
Any trick that works is good for me .
I don't completely distrust you .
Then my love is humble .
Oh , how I wish we could oppose Caesar's spirit , his overblown ambition , and not hack up Caesar himself !
Did you inform them of that ?
What's this man's reputation like here in the city ?
Stop !
I asked you for gold to pay my soldiers , and you wouldn't give it to me .
My lord !
I'd rather be anything besides a fool .
But you , my noble lords , may name a time , and I'll second it on the duke's behalf , which I don't think he'll mind .
Now all is for nothing .
You have wonderful armor , but give my horse his due .
Oh , you evil woman !
She knew an old song called "Willow" that reminded her of her own story , and she died singing it .
My lord , when I first saw him I thought he was your daughter's brother .
Fill my cup , Lucius , until the wine overflows it .
No , I won't cry any more .
People with too much invested in the world always get hurt .
Damn it , you're not listening to me !
Come to think of it , I am feeling sleepy .
Yes , you did , sir .
What's the news ?
Villains , you didn't do even that much when your vile daggers struck each other as they hacked up Caesar's sides .
I know him well .
I thank your Highness .
Can you bring me to him ?
Killing pigs .
It's not true .
I know how they think , and I understand why they're doing this .
Now I have to leave .
How are you , Lorenzo ?
My noble lord , What is it , Iago ?
I bet my life on it .
We might as well call him a man , since God created him .
My brother Gloucester's voice ?
Would I ever deny you anything ?
Come out .
He calls me "boy" and scolds me as if he had the power to whip me out of Egypt .
I was conceived by a woman , and I thank her very much for all her effort .
Until recently , I was as unimportant to his affairs as the morning dew is to the wide ocean .
Is it true that good King Edward has died ?
We answered them , blow for blow .
He's flabby and out of breath. , Here , Hamlet , take my handkerchief and wipe your forehead .
There's little or nothing of that .
Evil spirit , I want to talk some more .
Come , come .
Consider how poorly this reflects on me .
Ungodly and monstrous !
I've made my choice .
Too quickly , we boarded a ship .
But listen to me ; let me guide you .
I mean , with my head in your lap ?
Oh , it's too bad !
I'm only crazy sometimes .
Good heavens , those are difficult directions .
Oh , what a wonderful son , I can impress my mother !
And I'd be surprised if he even did that , for he prefers sports , fun , and friends .
Hey !
If we walk on the well-worn paths , they won't get caught in our petticoats .
It's true !
What's my name ?
Sunday is just around the corner .
Well , I'm glad that everything has been sorted out .
Oh , my lord , when wisdom and passion are in one body , it's ten to one that the passion will win .
Then you should offer the gods a sacrifice to show your thanks .
If the devil had such a beautiful house as his body , then good things would fight to live in it .
Spirit , we have to get ready to meet with Caliban .
What's the news ?
Where are you coming from ?
I didn't love you .
You were born from a woman .
By God , I wouldn't lose as much honor as a single man more would cost me , I think , not even if it meant giving up my best hope for victory .
Here .
Tell me .
Prince Dauphin , you'll stay with me in Rouen .
Block up my house's ears , I mean the windows .
She can stay at her father's house .
The duke of York sends your Majesty his respects .
The only thing you can sense are punches , just like an ass .
I can tell by how pale and deathlike they look .
My bones want to rest after helping me up to this hour .
Buck up , boy !
Will she go to bed now ?
My heart's as black as death .
And don't be suspicious of me , noble Brutus .
You see me standing here , Lord Bassanio .
Of brave earls , Grandpre and Roussi , Fauconberg and Foix , Beaumont and Marle , Vaudemont and Lestrale .
And Madam , with all my heart .
Hardly , Kate .
Do the deed that will make this island yours forever , and will make me , Caliban , your worshipful foot-licker .
The king of England's approach is as forceful as a whirlpool .
Is tomorrow the 15th of March , boy ?
You've kept away from me for a week ?
Come here , man .
Thank you kindly , sir .
Sir , here's the Queen .
She already has a face .
So , where's my wife ?
Ah , you're here ? , Come on , gentlemen , let's go !
Time , you thwart my dreadful plans .
Don't you know , master , that some men's best qualities do them in ?
Come on , Nerissa , I have many things to do that you don't even know about yet .
If she lives a long and happy life , then all women may as well turn into monsters .
I'm telling you , your husband .
Except that he has not yet agreed to address you in this form and with this title , in French , And even this I'm willing to grant if you request it .
It's driven me crazy .
My body waits here , but the rest of me is gone .
I'd wager twenty times as much on my wife .
As a friend .
But you have all the advantages from the harm done .
What , you mean kid actors ?
I must go to his house and tell his wife that he came bursting into my place like a lunatic and stole my ring .
I've become an enemy to my own soldiers !
I'll talk to you more about this some other time .
The sky's so dark it looks like it would rain down boiling hot tar if the sea weren't swelling up to the sky to put its fire out .
Get out , insolent eunuch !
These are tricks .
Now the inconstant moon has nothing to do with me .
Now , lords , don't let slip any opportunity that might be advantageous for our expedition .
Cassio's a good friend of mine , My lord , I can see you're upset .
Yes , Captain , but with this acknowledgement , that God fought for us .
For instance , our husbands
I've changed my mind now and partly believe in omens .
This will either make us or break us .
Yoo-hoo !
I remember you took the throne from your brother Prospero .
His neigh is like a monarch's command .
The devil sings like a nightingale to haunt Poor Tom .
Thus , it should be clear as day that King Pepin's title , Hugh Capet's claim , and the resolution of King Lewis's doubts all plainly derive from the female .
Make sure that the clowns do not ad-lib , since some of them will make certain dumb audience members laugh mindlessly at them , while an important issue in the play needs to be addressed .
How did you sleep , my lord ?
I'm sure I can guess .
At his best he's a little less than a man , and at his worst he's little more than an animal .
Say , what's the trouble ?
He's his mother's child from head to toe .
Now I'm in a great hurry , as I'm sure you can see .
Give me your hand .
I hope he's in love .
He's talking with the bogus father about the bogus son .
Listen , but don't speak .
Convince him that he has been out of his mind , and when he says he's out of his mind My lord , I promise we will play our parts so skillfully that he will believe everything we tell him .
I'd rather die in a ditch in Egypt , and make it my gentle grave .
Is that possible ?
So go to your deaths , poor miserable wretches , the pain of which may merciful God give you the strength to endure .
This is the brave sergeant who fought to keep me from being captured .
Good girl , give it to me .
You're on .
I could cure you , if you just called me Rosalind and came by my cottage every day to woo me .
He sees himself in my two eyes , so there's two of him .
Double , double toil and trouble , Fire burn and cauldron bubble .
You know me too well .
I'm coming , I'm coming !
I'll torture him .
She only appears honorable from the outside .
Less than a month after my father's death , even before the tears on her cheeks had dried , she remarried .
It was a bit short , my lord .
I won't argue with her , so her beautiful body won't disarm me. , Tonight , Iago .
Farewell , old man .
Nobody I care about more than myself .
Whatever you want , I made it for you .
Just do it carefully. , And to think that the noble and loyal Kent has been banished , for the crime of telling the truth !
I've promised to make everything right .
Dighton and Forrest , whom I hired to perform the butchery , are used to killing people , the bloody dogs .
That's right , except for the widow Dido .
Oh , the glory of war has faded .
The candle is burning in your study , sir .
So tell me what's been going on .
So how did it go , sir ?
He wasn't sad , because he knows that his disposition affects others .
I'll come soon .
Leave , you little man .
Don't you know me still ?
I'd tell them that I saw natives like these , since they must be natives , who are graceful and well-mannered even if they're monstrous to look at , kinder than most human beings you might find , kinder than almost any human .
Your Grace does me as great an honor as could be wished by any of his subjects .
You mean this is the whole problem , that she is shy and hasn't said everything she means to say and do ? , My lord of Burgundy , what do you have to say to this lady ?
That's very sensible , but you missed my sense : I meant Hortensio is afraid of you .
Madam !
The gentleman who serves you only for profit And is only superficially loyal to you Will take off when it starts to rain And leave you alone in the storm .
You'd make a good fool .
I'll go ahead of you , sir .
Delighted to hear you ask so nicely , but I won't stay in any case .
Carry them away .
Why ?
I'll get there first and tell him what we found out .
My lord , Hamlet's going to his mother's room .
He pretended that everything was fine until the moment they were exchanging vows , and then , with public accusation , blatant slander , pure hatred , Oh God , if only I were a man !
Uncle !
Yes , I swear .
I'll get there .
Yes , that's why you have to die .
Look , here come two noble animals , a man and a lion .
There's no one else here .
The noise they're making will wake up Demetrius .
He will be given safe conduct and money for his passage home .
Since it's drizzling , stand under this overhang with me and , like a true drunk , I'll tell you everything .
If the English had any sense , they would run away .
Who's that ?
What , does your wife say you can come home ?
Do I blame Nature for being so thrifty ?
Start the fire , good Curtis .
But , oh , it makes me bitter to look at happiness through another man's eyes .
My God , what a great song !
It's bad news when a country is ruled by a child .
Well , I'll go to Scone .
Do I speak to you kindly ?
For lawyers on vacation , because they sleep their holidays away , with no sense of how time moves .
There isn't much time .
That's right , uncle , talk to your heart , like the Good morning to you both .
Ask your husband if you doubt me .
We'll outwit them all , that old geezer , Gremio ; the suspicious father , Minola ; the prim musician lover , Litio , all for the sake of my master , Lucentio .
Do you really speak like such a gentleman ?
Oh-ho-ho , sir !
If you'd known how much that ring meant , how much the woman who gave it to you is worth , or how much your honor depended on your keeping the ring , you wouldn't have let it go .
Officers , take them away .
Merciful God !
Oh , right , good Catesby .
Hmm , let me see :
Madam , we have to go : the Prince , the Count , Signior Benedick , Don John , and all the gentlemen of the town have come to bring you to church .
Well , let's have it , Grumio .
And hot as ginger .
Sweet Hero ; when I imagine you now , you seem as beautiful as you did when I first loved you .
A loud-mouthed , drunken monster .
Your wife , sir , your wife .
The taming school ?
But when we have an hour to spare we can talk more about it , if you're willing .
Antipholus has gone insane , no question about it .
Even someone with a good and virtuous nature might give way to a royal command .
I'll kiss your hand , and with that I leave you .
Hero , the daughter and heir of Leonato .
This news will comfort Cassius .
He'll make your palace tremble for this insult , even if it were the mightiest in all of Europe .
I hope they don't attack us now .
If I'm telling the truth like a fool in saying all this , whip the first person who thinks I sound foolish .
Farewell .
If he doesn't show up , the play is ruined .
What , just because they kissed in private ?
I'll make ground beef out of you .
Catch me if you can !
No , not like before .
He's an honest man who detests evil actions .
And in return for this gift , he wishes you to drop your claim to the dukedoms .
So I thank you all , and I invite each and every one of you to come watch me be crowned king of Scotland at Scone .
I wish I had a fault like that !
Good spirit !
Two or three more lords and ladies have been married too .
Every glass of liquor is damned , and the devil's the main ingredient !
So , perhaps , did yours .
I myself am the King of Naples , since I saw with my own eyes , these eyes that haven't been dry since , my father killed in a shipwreck .
You stopped me .
Is it good news ?
These are bad omens , but I hope , I hope , they don't predict my future .
Call up the Master Constable Dogberry .
Caliban , who now serves me .
I believe drink did all of this to you last night .
You're both very precious to me .
And if the enemy is an ass and a fool and a prating idiot , does that mean , you think , that we should also be an ass and a fool and a prating idiot ?
Is the snake better than the eel because the pattern on his back pleases the eye ?
You've wronged Caius Ligarius .
The woman who might have blocked you from all the murders you've committed by strangling you in her cursed womb .
Off !
Oh ho , oh ho !
Well , even if he is her father , I'm sure she wouldn't want to have the head of the old man on her shoulders !
Father , go ahead .
To the Forest of Arden , to find your father .
I hope poisonous swampy fog covers her face and ruins her complexion !
Your father !
Answer me that first .
But Benedick was once an enemy of love as well , and now he's become a real man .
Every town and port is crawling with henchmen on the lookout , waiting to capture me .
Truthfully , my name is Cinna .
Cambio .
Really ?
Ah , my good old friends !
Retreat !
Robin Starveling , the tailor ?
A fine ship , with some good people in it , I'm sure , smashed to pieces .
Her only flaw , and it's a big one , is that she's unbearable , a total witch , so much so that I wouldn't think of marrying her myself , not even if I were in a worse fix than I am , not for a whole goldmine .
All the most beautiful paintings Are black when compared to Rosalind .
Say it again , just one word , and my hand , which killed your lover out of love , will kill your far truer lover .
But who's with him ?
Listen , my lords , We're in a bit of a hurry , Leonato .
His name's Cinna .
Now , my friendly servant , thank you .
If you see anything else , let me know .
Why , you silly man !
I swear , I'm telling you what I honestly think .
The blows I gave you already will make up for your upsetting me .
Not tonight , today .
What does this say ?
Someone knocks .
Very good , sir .
That's burglary , that is .
The best news of all is that we've located our king and our men .
Are you crazy ?
I'll remember .
And you've come at a good time , so you can convey my greetings to the senators and tell them I won't come today .
That's as good as proof that the sweet young man's in love .
I have a pretty good ear for music .
Speak , I command you .
Is that possible ?
But insincere men , like horses who are too lively at the start of a race , make a big show of their spirit .
And that would get us all executed .
Never apologize , when the actors are all dead , no one can be blamed .
I am sorry for her , as I should be , since I am both her uncle and her guardian .
No more , please .
I want you to do some things for our wedding , and I also want to discuss something that concerns you both .
I should go to the barber's , monsieur , because I think I'm getting really hairy around the face .
You're not as close to death as you think you are .
My name's Macbeth .
Well , that's what he's doing , making you free to enjoy heaven .
If I were to make a prediction regarding this union , I wouldn't say that .
A horse , a horse , I'd give my kingdom for a horse !
You all saw that on the Lupercal feast day I offered him a king's crown three times , and he refused it three times .
I'd be wasting my skills dealing with an idiot like that if I couldn't get something useful out of him .
Can you imagine cement and stone talking better ?
We
Will they stop working when their voices mature ?
I'm sure some Christian will resort to trickery to get you .
So , tell us , did you see that thing again tonight ?
Don't greet your bride in these disgraceful clothes .
Maybe until after Theseus's wedding day .
But Miranda is so much more beautiful , you can't even compare the two .
Hymen brought her from heaven Yes , brought her here .
In God's name , I beg you not to wish for one more man .
I think we'll have to leave out all the killing , come to think of it .
The privilege of never seeing me again .
In short , when I told him how firmly opposed I was to his hideous plan , he pulled out his sword and lunged at my defenseless body , cutting my arm .
The generals want to speak with us .
You mean "paragon." A The duke's leaving the temple .
Short but still tedious ?
I'm starting to feel murderous urges .
Please come with me .
But in that "no hope" there are great hopes for you !
Yes , as kind as snow to a harvest .
Come here , Proculeius .
Let us die honorably .
What do I see here ?
I just saw him yesterday , " or "the other day , " or whenever it is , you know , "and there he was gambling , " or "there he was , totally wasted , or fighting with somebody about a tennis match , or going into a house of ill repute" , that means a whorehouse , you know , or whatever .
It's leaping about like a frisky horse .
Bring me the handkerchief , My mind is full of doubt .
I have neither cleverness nor rhetorical skill nor the authority nor gesture nor eloquence nor the power of speech to stir men up .
Well , I'm not beautiful , so I hope that I can at least be chaste .
Lady Beatrice is angry with you .
How are you feeling now ?
That would be a little extreme !
How can we avoid what the gods want to happen ?
He's not a "master , " sir , he's just a poor man's son .
Is the duke of Exeter safe ?
Oh , sir , on her nose , which is covered with pimples , sores , and red welts .
We need some oracle to tell us what's going on .
That's no way to pray .
He's waiting outside .
Good morning , old Sir Thomas Erpingham !
She was so young , but she deceived her father so thoroughly he thought it was witchcraft !
You have to stop talking like this .
But let me see , by ten we shall each have captured a hundred Englishmen .
We say the king is wise and good , and his noble queen is getting old , pretty , and not jealous .
Surely , Luciana , it's already two o'clock .
I'll take it over to the pile .
If you and I don't value her equally , it would be better for us to work out our differences without her .
If there were anything inside their heads , they could never wear such heavy helmets .
Otherwise , I'll do it anytime , as long as I'm able .
I'll do it .
I might as well go before the King of France , who took my youngest daughter without a dowry , kneel before his throne , and beg him to give me a tiny pension to stay alive .
I saw that .
Nothing , but this is true .
But listen , if
You sound like a cattle dealer : that's the way they sell bulls .
Didn't you clearly say "Knock , " "pound , " and "put your fists to work" ?
I don't mean that she wants me because What's she like ?
That's what the bill says .
Do promise , Kate , that you'll do your French part to bring forth such a boy ; and for my English half , take the word of a king and a bachelor .
I still have the smell of blood on my hand .
I'll scalp you .
Strategy makes a better soldier than haste .
Let me see Philostrate .
I don't think it would be wise to let Mark Antony , whom Caesar is so fond of , outlive Caesar .
They did want me to tell her , but I persuaded them that , if they truly loved Benedick , they would try to get him to battle his emotions and keep Beatrice in the dark .
What was the last cry for ?
Where did she die ?
If you really are Sir Rowland's son , as you've just whispered to me , and I can absolutely see the likeness in your face , you are truly welcome here .
Friends , Romans , countrymen , give me your attention .
Yes , you're right .
Why , Fool ?
What captain do you serve ?
A king , perhaps , My lord , How is it that the prophet didn't tell me at the time that I would kill him ?
Yes , my lord .
Come , come , you weak , ungovernable worms !
Just because I act familiar with you sometimes and let you fool around and joke with me , you try to take advantage of my affection .
I invite you all aboard my ship .
Or stole it , rather .
It's certain that she is dead , and she died in a strange way .
Where is he ?
My lord is so heavy !
I hear their drums .
I'd be angry with you if the occasion allowed .
What , everybody falls asleep so fast ?
Poor imitation queen , why do you align yourself with this humpbacked spider when he's got you trapped in his deadly web ?
This clearing will be the stage , and this hawthorn bush will be our dressing room .
But I won't attack a woman , even if she is a demon .
Tell me where you learned these strange things , and why you stop us at this desolate place with this prophetic greeting ?
Pick me up .
Go to the church : take the priest , the clerk , and some reasonably honest witnesses .
I will , sir .
If you can't remember the stupidest little thing love made you do , you haven't loved .
Oh , wine is the devil !
Send me away ?
We've all been duped .
Don't run away , stay where you are .
Yes !
Tell him I've spoken to my husband on his behalf , and I think everything will be all right .
Again !
It's true , my lord .
Oh , good Demetrius , will you find him for me ?
Slay !
I have thousands of logs to take away and pile up , on strict orders from him .
What quality is that , my lord ?
Look who's here !
Since I was three years old , I've been in contact with a powerful but virtuous magician , no black magic here .
I won't listen to you .
I'll have nothing to do with you .
I don't even know him .
I thought everything out here was wild , which is why I acted so stern and commanding .
What , my good lord ?
Speak , my fair one , and speak fairly , I beg you .
That's a sin young men often commit because they allow their eyes to wander .
Charmian !
Please don't ruin any more of my poems by reading them so badly .
Yes ?
Yes , from Normandy .
No , vain illusion , so intricately bound up with a king's rest .
Macbeth .
Young Prince Edward is still alive , what do you think I'm going to say next ?
This is a miracle , if you talk of miracles .
No , Octavius Caesar , we'll respond to their charge .
But we can talk more about that tomorrow , when we'll discuss matters of state that concern us both .
Yes , let her die and rot and go to hell tonight .
No , uncle , I won't be married .
What fate is that ?
Don't worry , I couldn't care less .
We'll see them immediately .
If what you say is true , you can do the same to me .
Be quiet .
What's going on , my lord ?
What I'm saying is , your jealousy has pushed your husband away from his sanity .
Is the king leaving here today ?
Not really , unless you were ugly .
Which one of you killed the deer ?
Indeed , Hero herself can !
A golden mind doesn't bend down to choose something worthless .
Who deserted this morning ?
My lord .
I'm all right .
She's very moral .
Is that so ?
But those who understood him smiled at one another and shook their heads .
Or maybe I've got a hankering for a bundle of hay .
In your own kitchens you act like wildcats .
You must be the one who laughs when boys or women tell you their dreams .
Oh , please , tell us , sir .
Retreat further , my lord , retreat further .
But please tell me , is my boy , God rest his soul , alive or dead ?
He thanks you on his knees many times and considers himself fortunate to have fallen into the hands of one , as he thinks , who is the bravest , most valorous , and thrice-worthy gentleman of England .
Let's do that , Lysander .
He was the one who denounced his father .
Who offered him the crown ?
Would you rather that Caesar were living and we would all go to our graves as slaves , or that Caesar were dead and we all lived as free men ?
You must be over there .
Your brother's right-hand man .
I'd never heard such raucous music , such pleasant thunder .
The source from which your royal blood comes has been stopped .
He will have only justice and his penalty .
Honest to God , where's the sexton ?
Follow me .
We'll be married tomorrow .
What's that ?
We all must die , Messala .
I have to pretend to threaten you with my sword .
Where are your tenants and your followers ?
I'm afraid you'll keep going until then .
Will you come with me ?
If only you had a clearer memory of who you are !
Yes , absolutely , no question or ambiguity about it .
What good luck !
I mean when I wore it at your daughter's wedding .
I'd rather carry a reed that obviously can't protect me than a sword I can not lift .
They ought to be whipped for being so stupid .
The wisdom of your loyalty , fair Bianca , has cost me a hundred crowns since dinner .
It's a messenger from the warships .
Many men have sold their souls Just to view my shiny surface .
She's busy and can not come ! " Is that an answer ?
Come on , Nerissa , I want to go see this man who's come so courteously .
Messala , today is my birthday , I was born on this very day .
I didn't hear it .
In order to flatter Caesar , would you flirt with the servant who laces up his pants ?
What do you want to tell me ?
Let me see .
Or Tuesday noon or at night , or Wednesday morning .
I hope what she's saying is well , sir !
Now he's saying how she took him into our bedroom .
My heart's too sad for long goodbyes .
Take up the sword again , or take me up .
Send out more cavalry .
Make peace with God , for you must die , my lord .
I'll rest now .
What's going on here , you secret , evil , midnight hags ?
Oh , my handsome nephew , I must not say that .
These revelations have overwhelmed her .
He'll never follow anything that other men have started .
Don't believe in this .
I think I can guess what you're about to say .
Oh , the man who avenged her could ask anything of me !
I , Wall , have done my part .
Yes , on land you do outnumber me .
And how he loves Caesar !
Will you be having dinner with her tonight ?
It was not Caesar's bravery that conquered Antony but Antony's that has triumphed over himself .
Are you going to hide and watch them having sex ?
I see you've met with the jeweler .
The heart won't be reasoned with .
Some tardy cripple must have taken the counter-order , who came after Clarence was already buried .
But why am I telling you this ?
Yes , my good lord .
Speak , Claudio , that's your cue .
It would follow from this that the cat should stay home .
Stay and tell me more .
That's what we're trying to say , sir .
Oh , what an excellent thing this learning is !
Murder , murder !
Adultery ?
One servant cried , "God bless us ! " and the other replied , "Amen , " as if they had seen my bloody hands .
I think you're all either bewildered or stark raving mad .
What's the name of this forest behind us ?
Are you coming monster ?
How's my nephew doing , noble lord of York ?
Then I'll listen to her .
Good sir , stay close to me .
Great happiness !
My stupid heart , which I'm leaving behind here .
What's the matter ?
Enough !
How is my lord ?
It's as silent as a graveyard here .
I've spent five years in the remotest parts of Greece and roaming all over Asia .
I can tell you who time strolls for , who it trots for , who it gallops for , and who it stops cold for .
What does your grace want ?
Really , the priest was good enough , no matter what that old guy said .
The street is narrow here .
Let's assume that she has a reason , which you don't know yet : have faith that she'll eventually explain why she shut the doors on you today .
Keep this libertine occupied with endless debauchery .
And this is why your servants hang their heads in sorrow !
Run away , I beg you !
Please pardon our brother Clarence .
Where's lady Portia ?
Who , me ?
Caesar was a tyrant .
No one , Brutus , no one .
For what ?
Until then , my noble friend , think about this : I'd rather be a poor villager than call myself a citizen of Rome under the hard conditions that this time is likely to put us through .
you will And what if he won't stop ?
I'm satisfied .
This island contains everything beneficial to life .
Well , call them back again .
If I could win a lady by playing leapfrog or vaulting into my saddle with my armor on my back , though you may accuse me of boasting , I could easily get myself a wife .
John Duke of Norfolk and Thomas Earl of Surrey will lead the horsemen and foot soldiers .
Is it because of
Ratcliffe , around midnight come to my tent and help me put on my armor .
Please do , madam .
Confess and love" is more like it .
Where else should his eyes be , if not in his head ?
This is a sleepy tune .
Whoa , man , you dare to support someone who's been proclaimed a traitor ?
Is he dead ?
Wasn't he friends with all those brawling knights who serve my father ?
I'm Lorenzo , your love .
Well , should we head to the Tower ?
No , I don't , sir .
She will wither and come to a bad end .
Three thousand ducats , hmmm .
Cassio , my lord ?
But if you live to see yourself similarly denied your rights , this foolish patience will abandon you .
When I've plucked this rose , I can't make it grow again ; it will have no choice but to wither and die .
What are they doing in the north when they should be in the west serving their king ?
Young budding virgin , fair and pure and sweet , where are you off to ?
Imagine them locking me out on a night like this !
Who doesn't know he's dead ?
I'm just worried that you've been cozying up to her , and gotten intimate with her .
You thug !
But how wonderful that she should be so fond of Signior Benedick , whom she has always appeared to hate .
Cupid is a bad boy for making poor women go crazy like this .
He's insane .
But what about Cicero ?
Look , it's my dear Lady Disdain !
I'd heard about my brother's plan and have been subtly trying to change his mind , but he's determined .
No , go ahead and take my life .
Listen to this .
Away !
They're natural enough." I think these things are omens of things to come in our country .
Dead , dead ?
I think I did , sir .
What I think about this , and about what's happening here in Rome , I'll tell you later .
This is pure insanity .
It is .
The coroner's inquest law .
Are you thinking of buying her ?
So you'll be hanged at the state's expense .
Nevertheless , it's all one , the two rivers are as alike as my fingers are to my fingers , and there are salmon in both .
Then get to work , poison !
What does she say , madam interpreter ?
Can't do it .
Madam , here comes your husband .
Do you think I'd break my oath ?
I know a thousand immature tricks like that , and I'll use them all .
He didn't say anything , he's reading .
I'll just speak a word or two here in the house and then I'll go with you .
Sir , I believe this piece of trash , Bianca , has something to do with all this trouble. , Hang in there , Cassio. , Come here , bring the light .
Shall we get to work ?
I have a daughter named Katherina , sir .
You will always be welcome to me .
He's killed his wife !
I'll commute your death sentence .
It would be a pity to throw them away for nothing , but if it's a matter of choosing between them and a great cause , then they're worthless .
You have to wait for the appropriate time to let loose .
I hope he is , but mothers get to have their doubts .
No , I think there's more to this than you're letting on .
Good-bye , kind Charmian .
Go find him , please , and bring him to my tent .
But my dear , when I said I was worth nothing , I was actually bragging , I should've said that I was worse than nothing .
He's in They say he cried out against sherry .
I'll bleed to death .
The lady has died because of the false accusations of me and my master .
Yes , it is .
That's most appropriate .
The brave experience death only once .
And I'm telling you it was burnt and dried out .
Say , isn't this the Latin master Cambio ?
She said she wished she hadn't heard it , but she also wished there was a man like me for her .
Look , here are the boxes , prince .
And yet I feel it's very hot and humid , which is bad for my complexion .
You're now within a foot of the cliff's edge .
Humble as I am , I represent Antony .
CALIBAN Stephano !
They were planning to pull a mischievous trick on Ferdinand and Miranda , who have sworn not to sleep together till their wedding day .
You're cold , cold , and you were never hot with lust .
How's it going ?
Of what
He certainly is .
You are lesser than Macbeth but also greater .
Our reasons are so well considered that even if you , Antony , were Caesar's son , you would be satisfied with them .
But it's no treason for an Englishman to cut off a French crown , a head , I mean , and tomorrow the king himself will do some snipping .
Help !
Tell me that you'll accept my love .
Goodbye .
Maybe she was just naked in bed with him for an hour or so , but they didn't do anything .
Then both , or one , or anything you like .
Oh , Master , master , look !
You're right , that's how it is .
These two Antipholuses , who look so alike , and these two Dromios , who seem to have the same face , and her story of being shipwrecked , why , these two are the parents of these children and have been reunited by accident .
Is that true ?
Maybe the king is sending you to the Tower to have you renamed .
We're lucky that Rome is rid of him .
We're safe from my father for at least three hours .
Let me hear what Agrippa has to say .
Are you indeed ?
Murder , murder !
You've heard a lot .
Why , this was modeled on a porridge bowl !
What's there to say ?
Let's go !
Well , then , what should we do for fun instead ?
Keep my cups full and treat me as you did when my empire was one of your fellow servants , obeying my commands .
That's how it will be for some other men , too , who think they're as safe as you and I , who are well-loved by noble Richard and Buckingham .
What do you want me to do with this ?
Alas , you don't know .
How green !
He's more of a soldier than a wise man .
I don't understand all dat .
We rejoice to see you , most worthy brother of England .
I'm sure it is to knight you , Captain .
But he's got to build churches for that to happen , my lady , or else he'll have to put up with being forgotten , like the hobby-horse in the popular song that goes , "Heigh-ho , heigh-ho , the hobby-horse is forgotten." What does this mean , my lord ?
What's your name , please , friend ?
Sir , I'm upset .
My God , she can't be a Jew , she's too nice !
I'll fight until they hack the flesh off my bones .
They burn for revenge .
Honest , yes , honest .
Go tell your generals to hurry their preparations .
My thoughts were never on money .
But you know , sirrah , we customarily say that the dead are well .
So get ready to leave .
Thieves !
I want to go home .
But step aside , fairy !
And at the base of Pompey's statue , with his cloak covering his face , which was dripping with blood the whole time , great Caesar fell .
Come , let's join our hands until the overpowering wine makes us soft and forgetful .
How many months do you want ?
That's true , and with good reason .
I hope God makes you happy again , like you once were .
I'm happy about that .
Beware the thane of Fife .
I wish my horse moved as fast as your mouth and was as tireless .
Please , master , tell me .
Hang our flags on the outer walls .
Oh , that's ominous !
Discipline must be kept .
Yes , right away .
Remorseless , treacherous , sex-obsessed , unnatural villain !
Descend .
Did you go to bed so late , my friend , that you're having a hard time getting up now ?
I serve the king , who sent me here .
Yes , ma'am , we have .
You don't know that ?
How can this drama be so many contradictory things ?
You go down toward the Capitol , and I'll go this way .
Well , I'll hurry and put these papers where you told me .
Pay attention to Metellus Cimber .
What's the bet ?
Lucius !
I'm still a virgin .
This castle is in a pleasant place .
I'm ready now to hear what my good cousin the Dauphin has to say , for I hear that the greeting you bear is from him , not the king .
What , you ignore my kind advice and try to please the devil I'm warning you about ?
Hail to you , thane of Glamis !
I see the downfall of my family .
With all my heart .
You evil whore !
How are you , my royal lord ?
And then Pyramus showed up .
Come on , please sing .
Fix your example , shepherd .
True , " she said , "a fine little one." "No , " I said , "a huge wit." "Right , " she said , "a hugely awful one." "No , " I said , "he has a good wit." "Exactly , " she said , "it's good and mild ; it doesn't hurt anyone." "No , " I said , "Benedick is wise." "He is certainly , " she said , She cried a lot at that , and said she didn't care .
Cicero too ?
I'm the one who , I'll get right on that .
Yes , my lord .
I'll beat him despite his fancy fencing techniques and all the practicing he does , despite his youth and manliness .
Show your slaves how mad you are , and make your servants tremble .
How could that happen ?
Call that servant back .
I put those wedding sheets on your bed , as you asked .
I'm not like that now .
He certainly flattered them both with extravagant compliments .
I will walk around and mingle with all of you , playing the humble host .
Please have a seat .
What part of her body is Ireland ?
Master Fer !
Double , double toil and trouble , Fire burn and cauldron bubble .
That's the right attitude .
You look too much like the ghost of Banquo .
That's not your fault !
You really don't recognize me , father ?
Most royal sir , Fleance has escaped .
I'll do all that .
I knew from the first it would be this way .
And you , sir , had me arrested over that necklace .
As a child , he took such a long time to grow up that , according to his rule , he should have grown up into a gracious adult .
So young , my lord , and honest .
But tell me .
Give me some ink and paper .
Sir , it's shaped like itself and is as wide as it has width .
You're sharpening that knife not on your sole but on your soul , you cruel Jew .
You are welcome here , my friends .
But they aren't .
Who can say I'm evil when my advice is so good ?
Is he in his royal garments ?
That's just what I thought .
If you had foul words in your mouth , then your breath must be foul , and foul breath is nauseating .
They deserved to keep their heads more than some people who have managed to keep their positions .
Brutus , my lord .
I'll do it even if I find you in the company of the king himself .
Sir , I make my living using an awl .
is yours." And , though I say so in his presence , if he's not a friend of the best kings , you'll find him king of the best friends .
Oh , for Pete's sake !
Cassius , don't take it badly .
There they go , Silver !
For that reason he sends you this good news , that this very day your enemies , the queen's relatives , will die at Pomfret .
I know they're in Rome together , hoping for Antony to return .
I'm watching the play .
Well then , I'll do it .
Wasn't Charles , the duke's wrestler , here to speak with me ?
Your physical health matters more than your reputation .
No , I said his horse is coming , with him on its back .
But don't be afraid to take the crown that belongs to you .
What's going on , Othello , darling ?
I have no desire to go outside , yet something leads me there .
I'm here , sir .
Let us hear him .
Bring him to me in silence .
Oh , monster , we know secondhand clothes when we see them. , Take off that gown , Trinculo .
These are gracious tears .
No , by no means .
You shall advise me in everything having to do with Cleopatra .
Now go ahead and tell me the rest of your story. , Please go stand farther away .
Thank you for that joke .
Okay , I'm ready .
You promised to tell me .
By his dress I can tell he's my countryman , but I don't recognize him .
They know by those measurements if there will be famine or plenty .
For various reasons that must remain secret , please do this for me .
My God , they've given me a lot to drink .
Why do you want to do that , my lord ?
I swear , I could do so much , Please , no more .
Yes , fashion is fashion .
Why did I just send you home ?
What , are you crazy ?
So , in that case , tell me who's next in line to inherit the kingdom of Naples ?
For there never was a pretty woman who didn't like to preen in the mirror .
Heaven help me , I don't know you , sir .
He's not brave enough to be wise .
I do , and it sounds like you're talking in your sleep .
I'm proud to be Sir Rowland's son , his youngest son , and I would never change that , not even to be Frederick's adopted heir .
Demetrius , I'm ready to fight you as promised .
Write to him immediately .
I might come back soon .
No , don't cry , kind Eros .
What then , sick ?
I'm afraid he will .
Isn't that strange ?
To Brutus's , to Cassius's , let's burn them all .
And here comes the warden , just in time .
I'll tell twenty lies like that , so men will think I graduated from school at least a year ago .
I have it ready .
Please , sir , I beg you .
Pray God your wife doesn't send you a worse one .
Probably because my cheeks ' roses needed rain , which I could easily give them with all the tears in my eyes .
Tell me which part I'm going to play , then go on .
Divine , perfect woman , give me a chance to prove in detail that I'm innocent of the evils you accuse me of .
What was it ?
Since the light of my life has gone out , I'll stop here .
Ever since I arrived here , just now , I've been hearing strange rumors .
Then that's the way it'll be .
That's very likely .
Signior Benedick served well in the war , my lady .
She has the patience of a I'll see you hanged on Sunday first !
Goodbye , good sir .
I have come to announce that Juno has asked you , Ceres , goddess of the fields and the earth , to leave your rich farms of wheat , rye , barley , oats , and peas , the hills where the
Get down and swear it .
It's born of my A witty mother !
And this is all because of our argument .
Let me deal with this .
Stop eating ?
As a friend or an enemy ?
This is the way to trick gullible fools .
Quick , let's hide , my lord .
Our forces are ready for them .
So go on , tell me the news .
A worthy fool !
If this is so , be patient , sister .
Why are you doing this ?
Don't I have a reason to be angry , you disobedient hags ?
Oh , now you weep , and I sense that you feel pity .
I swear , I scorn the word .
If either of you knows any secret reason why you two should not be joined in marriage , I order you on your souls to say so .
This bad weather isn't good to walk around in .
But I have the meantime .
Stop !
We need more help !
Wonderful !
The higher the Nile flows , the better the harvest .
I'm the man who was born to tame you and change you from a wildcat Kate into a Kate as gentle and domestic as other household Kates .
I can't make myself a man by wishing I were , so as a woman I'll die , from grieving .
Why is that ?
Mine , neither .
Hey , Cassio !
Good gentlemen , give me permission to speak .
No , I won't take a husband until they make men out of something other than dirt .
I'm right behind you .
Oh , Cassio , where did you get this ?
He's lying through his teeth !
Your Majesty didn't present yourself as the king .
Come away with me .
You will be whipped .
I've almost forgotten what fear feels like .
Look , here comes just the man we were looking for .
Your highness , I want nothing more than what you've already offered .
My dear , let's go inside and wait for them to arrive .
But I have a sinking feeling anyway .
A kind good night to all !
Today was the day I breathed my first breath .
You are as well provided in both respects as any prince in the world .
Then know that from my soul I love your daughter .
Who's there ?
Well , I recognize this one Good God !
It's so scary to look down !
Wait a minute , Jew .
Go away !
The day will come when you'll wish I could help you cast spells against this poisonous , hunchbacked toad .
Don't you
Goodbye , Helena .
Regret and everlasting shame sit on our helmets , mocking us .
I beg you to let me go .
Here , hang them on this clothesline .
Even my tears burn me like molten lead .
Then , rejecting my request , you kill
Our hour is up .
I won't until I'm ready .
Don't even think about refusing .
Oh , he's good at bending words around !
Not at all , not at all .
He'll come right away .
My noble kinsman , welcome .
Stop , brave lady , stop !
No , nor could the devil's name be more frightening .
Let's not stay here with them .
But now I'll grit my teeth and kill anyone who tries to stop me .
I haven't seen him for two days .
Well , I've begun my reign with a carefully thought-out plan , and I have every hope of succeeding .
Are we all here ?
He hasn't arrived yet .
But try to control your speech .
No , he's a devil , a devil , I tell you !
I will too .
That man always looks so sour !
If you dare to fight today , come to the field .
Did you see the gloomy Lord Northumberland ?
I'll meet you at the ferry .
What's that trumpet for ?
My pretty children , both of you misunderstand me .
Then you would have to go beyond heaven , beyond earth .
It might happen that these strange signs , the unusual terror of this night , and the urgings of his fortune-tellers will keep him away from the Capitol today .
Let's stay and hear the will !
You have .
My murders will never come back to threaten me until the forest of Birnam gets up and moves , and I will be king for my entire natural life .
I tell you , this will make her angry when she hears about it .
What a fool I've been !
So is Lysander .
Princes and counts !
Gravestones have been known to move , and trees to speak , to bring guilty men to justice .
Were you born here in the forest ?
When he leaves , it's very important that I talk to you .
You won't leave this grove until I've paid you back for this insult .
If you prick us with a pin , don't we bleed ?
My brains are injured .
I've had news that my Nell died of the pox in a hospice .
Does that mean he's lazy ?
I know you know something , Thanks for the compliment , I'm happy you know that .
He once said the devil would get him because of women .
Do you know the difference , my boy , between a bitter fool and a sweet one ?
Go ahead .
Why won't he ?
You think I'm kidding .
And no man with a reputation will tarnish that name with lies and bad behavior .
It turns kings into gods and men of lower rank into kings .
Otherwise , I'll die a virgin , devoted to you .
Good Captain Blunt , tell the earl goodnight from me , and tell him that by two in the morning I would like him to visit my tent .
Soldiers , watch carefully .
Hmmph !
What's the matter , dear ?
I'd rather go without the money .
Put on my crown .
Gouge out his eyes !
All this excitement has made the time fly by .
Have you sent anyone to Bottom's house ?
For it is written in the book of Numbers : "When the man dies , let the inheritance descend unto the daughter." Gracious lord , claim what is yours .
By God , I'm going to tell the duke how slack you've been .
He was a great human being .
She's well .
But our courage should only be the greater for that .
Cassius , what a night this is !
I'll wait over here .
Look , here comes the duke .
He'll kill me with tortures .
And lovers ' hours are a hundred and sixty times longer than normal ones !
That's uncivilized and unnatural !
Please walk softly , so not even a mole hears us approach .
You've connived to steal my daughter's heart , making her stubborn and harsh instead of obedient ( like she should be ) . , And , my gracious duke , if she won't agree to marry Demetrius right now , I ask you to let me exercise the right that all fathers have in Athens .
Listen to him speaking in quarter notes !
No , monster , not me .
But in fact it doesn't say much .
I insist , don't be more distressed than I am .
Damn you for teaching me your language !
Show .
Oh , in the duke of Gloucester's wallet .
Don't do this !
It's arranged .
I don't think any woman like that exists .
I gave him no order .
The next person to strike again dies .
Now , Baptista , let's turn to your younger daughter .
Who takes care of them ?
Malcolm !
Juno and Ceres are whispering about something serious .
That's why they say love is a child .
Very serious , and I'm sure it's because of Beatrice .
I swear I never hated you or your father !
Is that the law ?
No , don't pause , because I
You're welcome here .
You haven't forgotten the half of a kingdom I gave you .
I was engaged to both of them .
Is this true ?
The glove which I have given him to wear may possibly win him a box on the ear .
I did .
Bring me this plant , and get back here before the sea monster has time to swim three miles .
How can we tell which of us is the oldest ?
Find him and tell him to come here .
And whatever we do , we can lay all the blame on the drunken servants .
Yes , one , and this is how I did it .
You're a spirit , I know .
But if he's resistant and chilly , then be like that too and break off the conversation .
Even though I don't see it , this lady thinks I'm a marvelously good-looking man .
The cowslip flowers are her bodyguards .
Two or three men , my lord , who brought the message that Macduff has fled to England .
You want proof ?
Just now a tailor showed me fabrics he bought especially for me and then started to take my measurements .
Where is that moron of a cook ?
I will either get you out , lying if I have to , or stay in prison in your place .
But excuse me , Yes , I'm talking about Launcelot , sir .
Well , should we hear some music ?
Great Mark Antony is a widower now .
She says you're going to marry her .
That pale face of yours will frighten the others as well .
But how did you want it made ?
I will , my liege .
Do you have anything else to tell me ?
Goodnight , Michael .
Lead the way .
Monstrous !
Ha , ha , ha !
That would make anyone cry enough to water his garden with his tears .
Then keep your vow , fellow , when you meet the man .
I've outshot you , and not for the first time .
But if you conspired against my position while you were there , I might be interested in the reason for your stay in Egypt .
But a stronger pity , for the wrongs committed against Rome , drove out our pity for Caesar , as fire drives out fire , and so we killed him .
Definitely a tailor , sir .
Yet he seems capable .
Remain calm until midnight , and then you'll see what the trouble is .
If it were nothing , you wouldn't need to hide it .
I'll be back soon , and if I haven't brought you anything to eat , I will give you permission to die .
I can't wait to meet her !
Yes , that the king is dead .
Why are you crying ?
Look how they kiss and carry on !
You should pity me for that reason , not hate me .
Yes , yes , Curtis , so hurry up and start the fire .
I have a daughter ( I have her until she gets married ) who's given me this letter , considering it her duty .
It will be as the gods see fit .
Go inside , Nerissa .
But tell me , monsieur , what sport are the ladies missing ?
And they've been plotting things together .
As for this ghost we just saw , he's a real one , I can tell you that much .
From our brother monarch , the king of England ?
Goodbye to you all .
There was a time when you'd freely tell me that words were never music to your ear unless I said them , that objects never pleased your eye unless I showed them to you , that touches never pleased your hands unless they were my touches , and that food never tasted sweet to you unless I had prepared it .
Now , welcome , Kate. , And let everyone bear witness that here I kiss her as my sovereign queen .
Cassio can have my job .
Did you hit your head ?
Come with us to Athens .
Oh , darling Phoebe , if you ever fall in love with some fresh face , then you'll know about the invisible wounds that love's sharp arrows can make .
Farewell to both of you , dear teachers .
And I for no woman .
Swear by my sword .
Yes , making a big fuss .
But not the woman who scolds , anyway , I hope .
We know you have a job to do , Brakenbury , and we'll do what you say .
Believe what ?
Being satisfied with a job well done is payment enough .
I'm not interested in anything a eunuch can do .
Now I'm afraid we've lost your son forever .
I remember your eyes quite well .
May the tongues of our critics rot !
Who pronounced this death sentence before a court of law could even convict me ?
Fortinbras swore never to threaten Denmark again .
Besides , I don't like you .
If we flee from the boar before the boar even pursues us , we'll only make the boar angry and suspicious , causing him to chase us when he never intended to .
There's no way to read a man's mind by looking at his face .
She cursed Hastings then .
You can argue as much as you like when there's nothing else to do .
Where is the fool I sent on ahead ?
She's gone .
He's a conspirator .
How ingenious to make horseshoes out of felt .
What if I went no further and chose this one ?
Let him be for a bit .
Good friend , " he said , "say that the faithful Roman sends an oyster's treasure to the great Queen of Egypt , and that he plans to enhance this meager gift by adding new kingdoms to her empire .
This storm has no pity for either wise men or fools .
But where did this happen ?
Go on , take them .
I would , my boy .
I Isn't this good ?
Look after my goods and possessions .
I'd rather be a peddler .
I sent Dromio to you with money for bail , but I don't think he brought it to you .
What did you say to me ?
You refused me both .
I hear what they say about him for doing that .
Is it all come to this ?
May your sword be victorious and everything you do succeed .
The poor thing , he is so shaken with a fever that it's terrible to see .
My good man Norfolk , hurry to your post .
A crown was offered to him , and he pushed it away with the back of his hand , like this , and then the people started shouting .
The servants , the duke , and your daughter all seem to be treating you less kindly .
No , you'll see , four days will quickly turn into four nights .
What will this do ?
I haven't done anything to you .
So , to answer your question .
When she put it on my finger , she made me swear never to sell it , give it away , or lose it .
Is there any natural cause for hardening of the heart ?
You would be committing a wicked sin by chiding other people for sinning , because you yourself have been a terrible sinner , as carnal in your appetites as lust itself , and all the swollen pustules of sin that you acquired in your freedom you now want to burst and shoot back into the world at large .
Now summon up the image of stealthy murmurs and engulfing darkness filling the wide vessel of the universe .
Don't provoke them to battle until we have finished at sea .
Cheer up , Antonio !
Do you think so , spirit ?
Just as hounds and greyhounds , mongrels , spaniels , mutts , shaggy lapdogs , swimming dogs , and wolf-dog crossbreeds are all dogs .
Reading their mail isn't as bad .
Brother , you've made a mistake .
Better late than never , and it's never too late to change .
No , no , they wouldn't .
Now , you tanned fieldworkers who are so tired of August's labors , get out of the dirt and come rejoice with us here .
Fine ! " he says .
She's always talking when I want to sleep .
God knows I have done my best to argue for you , and made him angry at me for being so aggressive .
God bless you and make you obedient , loving , and kind .
We both have eaten as well , and we can both endure the cold winter as well as he .
Yes , you're absolutely right about how worthy Brutus is and how much we need him .
Who are you talking to ?
I'd feel sorry for them , if I were human .
I remember .
The first time we see the world as newborns , we cry and scream .
It's just my bad luck .
He who survives this day and lives to see old age shall yearly entertain his neighbors on the eve , saying , "Tomorrow is
Yes , revered Queen .
But you're not down and out , either , are you ?
Come , here's some sauce to go with it .
Coward !
Listen a minute .
He knows no more about the proper practice of war , see , the ancient practices , than a puppy .
You inhuman dog !
Beat him up .
The lark shrilly singing up there is too far away to be heard .
Son , I'll stake you half that Bianca comes .
I'll recite a prophecy before I go .
It's a miracle you're alive .
Hurry , you slave !
An honest tale succeeds best when it is told simply .
I am the worst person alive , and I know it the best .
Your I mean my daughter is my flesh and blood .
You will seem even brighter and more virtuous when she's out of the picture .
What did he do when you saw him ?
You expect me to cry ?
Still , it stands to reason that he mustn't betray his fear , as it might dishearten his army .
It was just that the showiness of his grief sent me into a fury .
I'm growing a beard .
Hail , Caesar !
You'd think everyone was asleep .
Right on cue .
Men act imprudently sometimes , then realize their mistakes when they have time to think about them .
What do you believe ?
Hey , Brabantio !
Good evening , brother .
Then follow me and listen to my speech , friends .
She's so good at sewing , and a wonderful musician .
The whole world is a stage , and all the men and women merely actors .
Will you be here when I return ?
Most formidable Queen !
Gratiano !
In any case , do what you want .
Helena , we'll tell you about our secret plan .
There , Diomedes , there .
The king has agreed to every point : first his daughter , then everything else , as you strictly proposed .
Teach me how I should think and speak .
Take them away .
If you interrupt it , he'll foam at the mouth and go crazy .
The poor thing , I really think she loves me .
Now I feel my soul leaving .
Don't worry about the consequences .
Then by all means never let her walk in public .
I swear , before I die I'm going to see you sick with love .
His words are like poison to me .
I just know I'm not one .
But Audrey , there's a boy in the forest who claims you're his girl .
It is not nighttime now .
I flashed about faster than lightning .
Yes , my lord , I played the part of a gossip and brought him the news .
How are you , my lord ?
My gracious king .
He is positively stuffed with honorable virtues .
If you want to see your deceiver , then look at me .
Struggling with the wind and rain .
I didn't think you would follow me .
A man named Iago , the general's ensign .
Tell me once more what you say .
What a king Claudius is !
I'll take the banner from a trumpeter and use that .
Well , I'll get my revenge .
Caesar ?
Or at least that's what I plan to do before I let you go .
I can see you don't like this gentleman .
Take her to my tent .
I'm begging you .
Only an hour ago it was nine , and in another hour it will be eleven .
Explain , boy .
If I cut my finger , I'll use you as a bandage to stop the bleeding. , And your name , sir ?
No , I know that you're Signior Lucentio .
Passionately" ?
One of you go call the Jew into court here .
Draw your sword , you jerk !
Whoever is born on a day I forget to send a message to Antony will die a beggar .
What would you like to see ?
Control yourself , my precious Queen , and concede that my love is true .
And don't lie .
Madam !
I'm strong-willed .
Don't talk to me .
Now sit down , everybody , and rehearse your parts , Pyramus , you start .
It sang about my crimes .
That's what's driving her crazy .
Let's sit here on the church bench until two and then go off to bed .
Let me speak proudly : tell the Constable we're only workaday soldiers .
Scum !
If they seek battle with us , have them come down or else clear the field .
Why has all this been put on the table ?
Young man , when you wake up , if she's nearby , beg her to cure your lovesickness .
So now everyone will point at me and say , "Look , there goes the wife of that comedian Petruchio , if he could be bothered to marry the pathetic thing ! "
No , if I had power I would take world peace and throw it down to hell .
It's incredible , they didn't say a word .
Come , trusty sword .
We are fortunate in the change .
We'll never see each other again .
Are you hurt , lieutenant ?
Nothing can be made out of nothing .
Don't follow me .
A leathermaker will last nine years .
I didn't say free , madam .
Your Highness told me to ask for my commission today .
And , gentle Puck , take this transformed ass's head off of the head of that Athenian man , so that when he wakes up at the same time as the rest of them do , they can all go back to Athens .
Here he comes .
You're talking about killing ?
We should rip off your man's clothing and show the world the woman who has represented her own kind so badly .
Swear by my sword you'll never mention what you've heard .
Lean forward .
I don't like sports .
With this ring I give them all to you .
Were you listening to these verses ?
His counselors will govern as long as he's a minor , and then he'll take over .
I don't know what you're talking about .
Heaven knows .
All right , you've had your say , but we'll let the forest judge whether or not you spoke wisely .
The devil must be behind this .
Thank you .
I'll tell you what , Prince : a whole university full of wisecrackers couldn't change my mood today .
There's a knocking at the gate .
The Moor's killed my mistress !
We have not betrayed you .
It's easier to rule a third of the world than a wife like that .
And a bad singer , my lord .
You lowlife son-of-a-bitch !
You haven't seen anything , then ?
He who chooses me must give and risk all he has." You'd have to be more attractive for me to give or risk anything for you .
Adieu .
Every hour he comes out with some horrible new offense that puts us all on edge .
I believe it completely .
Ugly , wrinkled witch , what are you doing here ?
Was this ambition ?
His body will lie in my tent tonight , with the honorable observance that suits a soldier .
Listen up , you slave .
I don't think there's a single unhappy subject living under the protection of your government .
Six Barbary horses , six French swords with accessories , and three imaginatively designed carriages , sounds like a French bet against the Danish .
Yes , my good lord .
But we haven't made any preparations .
I wish some god could help me choose !
Caesar's knave will bring him a message for us .
Yes , it's just clothing .
Oh , I wish I could sleep again , so I could have another dream like that !
It wasn't the journey itself , uncle , but the troubles we encountered that made it wearisome and dull .
Caesar himself is in trouble and there are more adversaries than we expected .
All right then , confess and live .
Dear general , I never gave you any reason to hate me .
Oh , sir , you are too good at predicting the future .
What are you saying ?
Can't you see that ?
Let's listen to the moon .
Sport ?
All ladies love me , except you .
I never tried to win over a friend or enemy with sweet words .
Is there any way I could show such friendship to you ?
Let's get dressed quickly and then meet in the hall .
Hitting his wife ?
Sit down , Jessica .
Who can prosecute me for it ?
My trusty servant , Ariel !
I don't even know how much I'm spending to find them .
And find a poverty stricken gentleman who I can marry straightaway to Clarence's daughter .
Happy with Hermia ?
Wherever we go , men will smile at us while hiding daggers .
But when push comes to shove , they droop like those horses that are all show and slow to a crawl .
Go back again , slave , and bring him home .
In the first act he is an infant , whimpering and puking in his nurse's arms .
I'm full of joy .
Fast work and a little luck are all I need. , Brother , could I have a word with you ?
No , a flatterer wouldn't , even if the faults were as huge as Mount Olympus .
Wish I could say the same .
Please , pay him immediately .
An awful monster !
Ah , my poor princes !
Stop .
A mature age .
They've eaten themselves sick .
Conrade , I say !
Your Clarence , who stabbed my Edward , is also dead .
No ?
Only yesterday the word of Caesar might have stood against the world .
And who is England's king but an heir of the great York ?
There's certainly not a boy left alive , and it was done by the cowardly rascals who were running from the battle .
Give me a hand and help me off with this magic cloak .
No , he's an ordinary guy who 's got a gentleman for a son , since someone would have to be crazy to let his son become a gentleman before he's achieved that distinction himself .
Maybe it'll come again .
Signior Tranio , you also took aim at that bird , though you didn't hit her. , So here's a health to all who've shot and missed .
Get out , you horrible bastard , or I'll gouge out your eyes .
You're too bitter .
Shall we get started ?
Don't refuse the love we offer you .
Did you call me , my lord ?
From there we'll safely carry you to France and back , calming the waters of the Channel to provide you with a smooth voyage .
I see Regan and Goneril in hell , A thousand hissing devils with sizzling red pitchforks come up to them !
Listen , listen !
Are we bothering you ?
He looks like someone with a strange tale to tell .
The sweet fool in a fool's costume , that's me .
I'm afraid you'll come to me again for ransom .
The king , his brother , and your brother are all waiting there in a crazed state of mind , and the rest are grieving over them , sad and astonished .
Then turn your noble face away from me , that face that the whole world adores .
A drum , a drum !
Oh sirs , consider this : those who sent you to do this deed will hate you for doing it .
I'll go wait for Dromio at the marketplace .
My lady , with your permission , this note authorizes me to give myself to you with a kiss .
I won't have any of this .
He is , because he told Antonius to tell you he'd be there tomorrow .
I met my father in the woods yesterday and had a long conversation with him .
Then he shook Bassanio's hand affectionately , and they separated .
And shall our lively blood , quickened by wine , be so frosty ?
Good morning , Catesby .
Yes indeed it is , sir .
I'll miss you , Ariel , but you'll be free. , Yes , you will , yes. , Go to the king's ship in your invisible state .
What can you do but be happy ?
Whom do you serve under ?
Many men seek their fortune at seventeen ; at eighty , it's a bit late .
But please , tell him how well I faked a faint .
I'm no ordinary fairy .
Brutus" and "Caesar." What's so special about "Caesar" ?
Yes , sir .
Be patient , because the prize I'm leading you to will make you forget how smelly you are now .
Let's hear someone play the triangle and the sticks .
If you were my fool , uncle , I'd have you beaten for getting old before your time .
Your words , like your wounds , bring you honor .
Good day , Catesby .
He is , my lord .
Why ?
Well , if you don't , then I'm out of here .
Many people , men and women alike .
It's wrong , and I'm starting to realize I'm being cheated !
When I tell him he hates flatterers , he agrees , just at the moment when I'm flattering him the most .
Knock , knock !
We hope you feel better and find some peace .
What , is the man insane ?
Give me a little breathing space , my lord , a little pause to think .
Yes , I am the one .
Oh , my lord , you once said that lazy weeds grow fast .
However , this is an extreme situation , and it's more important to control it than to worry about how you'll look .
We've got to act fast , my lord of the fairies .
Just tell me this : have you ever seen her holding a handkerchief with an embroidered strawberry pattern on it ?
Say something again .
Sometimes I appeared in many places at once .
I wish we had a signed legal contract .
Humble greetings , great master !
There , Leonato , take your daughter back .
Insolent Oh , the good gods !
No , they're busy and as excellent as ever .
If she sends any letters to Richmond , you will be accountable to me for it .
I swear by the heavens , which have grown pale in sympathy with us , I'm going with you , whatever you say .
Thank you , sir .
You'll have your answer soon .
Oh , you mean when Beatrice writes a letter and Hero sees that it has "Benedick" and "Beatrice" written all over it ?
We'll talk about this later .
He's recruited Bocchus , the King of Libya ; Archelaus of Cappadocia ; Philadelphos , King of Paphlagonia ; the Thracian king , Adallas ; King Manchus of Arabia ; the King of Pont ; Herod , of Judea ; Mithridates , King of Comagen ; Polemon and Amyntas , the kings of Mede and Lycaonia , and many more .
You'll be back at two o'clock ?
If it's true that you don't need
These cowards manage to make fools of brave men .
We need a calendar !
Oh , really ?
Have more than you show , Speak less than you know , Lend less than you owe .
Wake up when something nasty is nearby .
Weren't you the one who made him desert Perigouna in the middle of the night , right after he'd raped her ?
As eagerly as I ever came from school .
Nathaniel's coat was being fixed , sir .
No lie , she screamed at you .
Become a better
Love's not love when it gets mixed up with irrelevant outside matters .
Do you ?
Stay in your cabins .
He has a very gloomy attitude .
You'll be my role model .
Too late is more like it .
Come sit on me .
I have a lot to do before noon .
You were worn with honor .
It was windy on shore too .
I look forward to getting to know you better .
Give me my sword .
Signior Angelo , please excuse us .
Our enemies have driven us to the edge of the grave .
And because you interrupt us so that we can't dance for them , the winds have made fogs rise up out of the sea and fall down on the rivers so that the rivers flood , just to get revenge on you .
Polite sir , let me say one thing .
I'm Christopher Sly , son of old Sly of Barton-on-Heath , a peddler by birth , a Oh , this is why your poor wife is mourning !
Okay , I will , on Fridays and Saturdays , and the rest .
They have a massive army .
Are you a suitor to the girl we speak of , yes or no ?
But on the prettiest branches Or at the end of every sentence I'll write "Rosalinda , " Teaching everyone who can read that the essence of every spirit Is contained in this one woman .
Don't say that .
Who do you obey here ?
She's mine , and I'm giving her to Demetrius .
It wants us to speak to it .
So everyone goes off into the world except me , who stays in because I'm sunburned .
That won't work , since I'm still reaping the rewards of that murder : my crown and my queen .
You told me they escaped into this forest .
The great emperor Caesar , dead and turned to clay , might plug up a hole to keep the wind away .
Therefore tell me , fairest Katherine , will you have me ?
Sir , he should have as many as Caesar has .
Good day to you , Captain Fluellen .
I'd never play pranks on you .
Bring him here and ask him .
I feel sicker and sicker .
Ah , dear , if that is true , let heaven make poisonous hail grow from my heart , and let the first hailstone drop down my throat .
Is it a beggar ?
Watch out , Ophelia .
I've relinquished my authority , so please , I'll see you all before long .
You can hear them all night long .
It's not true .
Tomorrow , and tomorrow , and tomorrow .
All right ! " It's not fine , and I'm not all right !
It doesn't matter if it's in tune so long as it's loud enough .
What is your name , young man ?
What , my lord ?
Knock , knock , knock !
Come on , you and I will go soon .
I love him even when he's harsh and mean , Help me unpin this , would you ? , I love even his stubbornness , his frowns , his bad moods .
Well , learn to make jokes at the appropriate time .
He's walking over there , sir .
Is it possible ?
My name is Hortensio , sir .
Let him hoist you up in front of the shouting crowds !
Oh !
With this I avoid the grief of Antony's death .
Everyone who does so is a traitor and should be hanged .
Don't you remember how he saw a flea land on Bardolph's nose and said it was a black soul burning in hell ?
He got there too late .
I'll show you where to get fresh water .
Stay close by when we wake him up , ma'am .
But so what ?
Yes , indeed , and all the King's men , the Duke of Milan and his fine son too .
He received me with courtesy and sufficient respect , but not with affection , nor with as much open and friendly conversation as he once greeted me .
His ships are maneuverable .
Oh , and monsieur , be careful not to break the honey-sac .
By this leek , I swear I'll make you pay for this .
I'll be at your service .
Since my beauty no longer pleases my husband , I'll weep away what's left and then die with weeping .
Feed him apricots and blackberries , with purple grapes , green figs , and mulberries .
We spend more time seeking out the fleeting glories of this temporary world than looking to the permanent grace of God !
Yes , and paid me well for doing it .
There is no jewel like Rosalind .
So give me my nightgown , Emilia , and I'll say goodnight .
Good morning , Richmond .
Damn that crazy madman !
No ?
But listen to me , signor ,
There is a river in Macedon , and there is likewise a river in Monmouth .
Who's coming ?
I can't watch any more .
A night isn't much time for addressing matters of this importance .
This way , we can see how the world moves .
Signor Antonio , you've often insulted my money and my business practices in the Rialto .
Now I realize your brother tried to kill your father not just because your brother is an evil man , but because your father deserved it by being wicked himself .
When I tried desperately to question them further , they vanished into thin air .
Run to the Capitol and nothing else ?
Oh , one child is one too many !
With this in mind , speak , my lord .
As surely as I am the queen of Egypt , Antony , you're blushing , which means you're Caesar's servant .
I will lower my voice .
Welcome to Elsinore .
Excellent in fencing , I mean , sir .
I could even supply the dialogue between you and your lover if you did your little puppet show of love for me .
And I see you survived your time in Egypt .
You're in a bad mood ?
I'm a poor man who's been humbled by many misfortunes .
Get us out of here .
Do you think I would live a life of jealousy , tormented by new suspicions every hour ?
Murder has no tongue , but miraculously it still finds a way to speak .
Don't say that , my lord .
Now let my courage prove my title as wife .
I'm sure there was a herd of lions nearby .
Don't wrong her birth .
It's another Hero !
When the poor cried , Caesar cried too .
Now we can shout , "Congratulations , congratulations , my lord and lady ! " My Lord Bassanio , and my dear lady , I wish you all the joy I can wish for .
When courage consumes reason , it destroys its only weapon .
Do you want to sleep ?
You did it ?
From their saddles into the dirt , but that's another story .
Bridegroom ?
You'd better go inside .
Find a father who loved his child as overwhelmingly as I loved Hero and ask
No , I'll recite it for you right now : "de hand , de fangres , de nails , " "De nails , " madame .
You don't know why we came to visit you , Yes , and so unexpectedly , at night .
My lord !
Just know this before I begin : I can't play a single note that's worthy of note .
I've acted like such a villain !
But if you would be willing to accept circumstantial evidence as proof , we can get that .
No matter what you say , my father is not dead .
Please go away , both of you .
Some Now listen , either give me my ring or give me the necklace .
I never , oh , what a mistake ! , revealed myself to him until half an hour ago , when I was in my armor .
He lost both , my lord. , Ma'am , this letter is from your sister , and needs an immediate answer .
I've already had a glass of wine tonight , watered down , but look how drunk I am .
Right now I'd give a thousand
Sit down and rest .
Ah , how pitiful !
Shall I stay in this dreary world , which is no better than a pigsty without you ?
As for those who have , I beg you to excuse the gaps in time , and the many people and things that can not be represented here in all their magnitude and proper form .
No .
And welcome , welcome !
I don't think a ridiculous Pyramus like that one deserves much moaning .
I wish I knew what was in your heart .
But you were with him , weren't you ?
Ask her to help you get back your position .
What's your profession ?
Tomorrow , I'll let you know what I've decided and what answer you should deliver to the king of England .
My lord , your son has paid the soldier's price : death .
No , you'll have to excuse me .
But I will tell you this very plainly : I have challenged Claudio , and either he'll accept the challenge or admit he's a coward .
There are ten thousand , Geese , you idiot ?
What's the reason for this horrible shouting ?
And he's friendly with Caesar .
His lips were nice and red , a little more lively and passionate than the red that was in his cheeks , one was pure red and the other more pink .
Why ?
You won't see anything like that , sweetheart .
No , that I don't remember .
Show us the way without further delay. , Trinculo , since the king and all our comrades are drowned , we're the heirs of this place. , Here , carry my wine bottle. , Trinculo , my buddy , we'll get that bottle refilled soon enough .
And we'll leave together , like friends .
He's going senile .
I'll fight at sea .
Here's the story we'll tell her : that I was with you at your shop , watching you make her necklace , and that you're going to deliver it tomorrow .
You admit it , then ?
Go in , or we're done for .
After you harvest , you have to sheaf and bind So throw ripe Rosalind on the harvest cart .
My brother's servants used to be my equals .
It's too small for your large mind .
What victory does he bring home ?
Why are you curious , Iago ?
In fact , I consider ambition to be so light and airy that it's only the shadow of a shadow .
Fake , I'm telling you .
Get it , sister .
Hello !
Come , warble for me .
I'll go join him there , going down deeper than any anchor ever sank , and lie with him dead in the mud .
Do you see this sweet sight ?
Go away , now .
This diamond is a present from him to your wife for her boundless hospitality .
He did , my lord .
He did , very sincerely .
Master , you were so focused on the girl herself , I wonder if you missed the main point here .
Yes , very well .
How are you , soldier ?
Are you a married man or a bachelor ?
Do you know the boy who was just speaking to me ?
Pray , let me stay .
Quickly , tell me how .
Ride , ride , Messala , ride , and give these dispatches to our forces on the other side .
My man Grumio !
Anyway , my conscience says , "Stay put." "Go , " the devil says .
If we take away Caesar's support , he'll have to come back down to earth ; otherwise , he'll fly too high and keep the rest of us in a state of fear and obedience .
My services are at your command .
What did I keep for myself ?
I will fight him there .
Well , don't face off with me .
I owe you a lot , and like a spoiled kid I've lost what I owe you .
And now who but you knows whether I'm yours ?
Oh cowardly conscience , how you're torturing me !
If you refuse to allow me to do so , your city's charter and its freedom are endangered .
And he did .
What does the silver one say ?
This shepherd boy reminds me quite vividly of my daughter .
A pretty pathetic monster .
I won't say a word .
Your disloyal uncle , are you paying attention ?
Then there must be no lovers in the forest , either , because they're as good as a clock , marking the lazy foot of time with a sigh every minute and a groan every hour .
I don't want to go mad .
Which one of them should I pick ?
Oh , no .
But she is now Mark Antony's wife .
I'm not Lear .
Everyone else will have to stay single .
My liege , this man is a villain and a traitor , who , see , your Grace , has struck the glove which your Majesty took from Alencon's helmet .
In fact , every imprisoned man holds in his own hand the tool to free himself .
But Antonio's certainly ruined .
We'll burn his body in the holy place and use the brands to set the traitors ' houses on fire .
My mistress Titania is in love with a monster .
Oh well , God's in charge , and some people have to go to heaven , while other people have to go to hell .
Run , master , run .
Be Conrade !
I'm sorry you don't have time. , Antonio , give this gentleman a reward .
Besides , you're a sponge !
You're busted .
By running fast .
But you don't have any of the symptoms my uncle told me about .
wise and graceful as the earth is wonderful and divine .
Come out , beautiful sun , until I've bought a mirror to admire my reflection in , I'll watch my shadow as I stroll along .
Any minute .
I found them on a tree .
You're my true and honorable wife , as dear to me as the blood that runs through my sad heart .
And then again , it's not so good , but only so-so .
Come , let's have one more extravagant night .
And then throw the seeds in the sea , to make more islands grow .
The Lord Mayor is knocking .
I am unfit to rule and to be king .
My cousin's a fool , and you are too .
Me neither .
Go , lad , and find out what the trumpet's sounding for .
But you can't see where you're going , sir .
Spread the word .
Give me your hand .
I'm not going to waste any more time with you .
Good Macbeth , we're ready when you are .
I have a favor to ask .
A lover would have to be weepier , of course .
He's shouting at the wind to blow the earth into the sea , or make the sea flood the earth , he wants to see the world return to primal chaos .
All to our advantage .
These are nothing but jealous lies .
And like I am for no woman .
If you like , we'll stand by and wait to do whatever you need .
Please avoid doing that .
Often , when I'm dulled by worry and melancholy , he lightens my mood with his merry pranks .
I can't recall where I slept last night .
I pray to God he isn't .
Free from the bondage you are in , Messala .
Say something !
Here's an empty seat , sir .
You just fell the height of ten ship masts , straight down .
It's very strange .
You can have what you want .
Near How large is his land army ?
No stony tower , no brass walls , no airless dungeon , no iron chains can contain a strong mind .
Let everyone beware : I can shake off the tyranny that now oppresses me whenever I choose .
You will never be able to say the same about me .
Listen , listen !
Go ahead , I'll yield to your power .
Take your cues from my own despair .
And who can help thinking how monstrous it was for Malcolm and Donalbain to kill their gracious father ?
Let's proceed on our march to Birnam .
Are your doors locked ?
Farewell , brother .
I will , Caesar .
The only glory princes have are their titles .
Now I've said it twice .
I beg the court to deliver the verdict .
Please tell me what you're thinking , even your worst suspicions .
What a worthy man !
Does it really make sense , once we divide the world into three parts , that he should be one of the three rulers ?
You're a senator !
Since she would love both of you , you two would be joined in that love .
How can you square things with me ?
It's his wife , Lady Grey , who got him to do this .
It was me , no one else .
I'm glad that my weak words have provoked even this small show of protest from you .
I think that Macedon is indeed where Alexander was born .
These outbursts of yours don't even look like real fear .
A witty if a cynical reply .
Be sad only at the fact that you'll lose your friend , your friend doesn't regret that he paid your debt .
Oh do-de , do-de , do-de .
Hermia's not holding onto me anymore .
Good evening , good evening .
Goodbye , old friend .
No , don't .
Your light dulls when he is near .
And you've done well on land .
Let's see .
Enough .
If you sit down , I'll carry your logs a while .
Come , let's be off !
Good madam , restrain yourself .
Don't let that lawyer ever come near my house !
I can't speak to her , even though she asked me to .
Then there's still a chance .
That's authority !
Will you have me ?
If he's not in love with a woman , then you can't trust the usual symptoms .
Your face betrays strange feelings , my lord , and people will be able to read it like a book .
Let me ask you something in private .
If they have spoken the truth about Hero , I will tear her apart with my bare hands .
Come on in , con man .
The servants Macbeth killed .
Oh , noble sir !
The Dauphin , whom we asked for reinforcements , sends back the answer that he's not yet in a position to raise so great an army .
I'd second your wish if it automatically meant that Lucentio could have Baptista's youngest daughter .
And isn't a sheep's grease as wholesome as a man's sweat ?
Take this , too .
Hooray !
He acts like a man in love .
You know I would never approve a war against my own cause .
Listen !
You kick me out , he kicks me back .
She provides an excellent moral .
But look , Cassius , Caesar looks angry and everyone else looks as if they've been scolded .
Speak once again .
Can you tell me if a man named Launcelot , who lives with him , is still there ?
Now let's sit closely around this candle and discuss our needs .
The man who tells a lie and swears by it is now considered as brave as Hercules .
Oh bloody Richard !
What , like stuff from a house ?
My lord ?
But let's see once more what the gold one says : "He who chooses me will get what many men want." That's Portia !
I hope I see him and hear him again soon .
I tell you , man , it's better for me , too , than the last time we met here .
Bring Desdemona here .
But you can't blame me for her offenses .
I hear his trumpet .
How foolish your fears seem now , Calphurnia !
Can't you see for yourself ?
She says something , sir , but I will not repeat it to you .
Well , sir , it's true it came soon after .
Remember your children as being sweeter than they actually were , and think of the man who killed them as worse than he is .
I know how his mind works .
You know , you're right .
When you ask for my blessing , I'll get down on my knees and ask you to forgive me .
I could do more to help Antony , but to do so would insult him .
So you finally find me worthy of your attentions .
Make us your agents of revenge , so we can praise you when we're victorious !
Mend" me , you impertinent fellow ?
Attack the breach in the city wall once more , dear friends , attack it once more , or else let's close it up with English corpses .
I seek no revenge for myself , but so dearly do I hold the safety of my kingdom , which you sought to destroy , that you must be punished according to her laws .
I hope those lions stay far away from him .
I'll do that .
How did you get this letter ?
The whole time .
Curse you !
Whip him , fellows , until he screws up his face like a baby and cries aloud for mercy !
Who is this ?
The other half goes to the state .
I'm a foolish , senile old man , eighty-something years old , not an hour more or less .
Yes , Desdemona .
Please don't make fun of me .
My creditors are getting mean .
Nobody like that should be trusted .
You're right .
I've heard that the pyramids build by the Ptolemies are splendid .
If you come to me after tomorrow and say , "That's my glove , " I swear by this hand , I will take it and give you a box on the ear .
I hope it doesn't make me unchaste that I really want to be a married woman .
Meanwhile , we're the ones who need you .
Time will tell what you've got up your sleeve .
For love to appear in his true likeness , he would have to be as Cupid is : naked and blind .
How are you , my love ? , Demetrius and Egeus , come with us .
I forgot about the reward .
For we may take pity on you , even if we can't pardon you .
Forever and a day .
Goodbye , then .
That's a Cornish name .
Oh , with his sordid desertion , he sets the example for our own .
Orlando ?
When he's there next time , I'll send my daughter to see him .
A nice message .
Then the wrong man is dead , and sweet revenge has gone wrong .
The English army is near , led by Malcolm , his uncle Siward , and the good Macduff .
We're following you not only because it is our duty , but also because we want to .
Look , the precious Desdemona has arrived on shore .
More shouting !
Judging from his appearance , I bet he can tell us the latest news about the revolt .
Kingdoms and provinces dropped from his pockets like loose change .
Take a tip from me , then .
Bless you , master .
No , my lord .
Add details of your own to back up what I'm saying .
Then be so kind as to show them in .
The day , my friends , and everything await me .
We'll go to the river .
Please wait .
King Edward was going to marry Lady Lucy , your mother can vouch for that , and then he was betrothed to Bona , the King of France's sister-in-law .
Take it , brave York .
What did you think about that French lord , Monsieur le Bon ?
Meanwhile , thank you for your efforts .
Don't speak any further .
Then say good-bye to me and tell me those tears were for my benefit .
I feel bad for scaring you like this , but it would be much worse for me to let you come to harm .
If we meet again , then we'll smile indeed .
What's all that shouting about ?
And , Kate , when France is mine and I am yours , then France is yours and you are mine .
The princes left your daughter here for dead .
Well , I disagree .
Let me shake your hand .
And then she brought me up , and I thank her for that , too .
Oh , what a world this is , when even what is beautiful in a man poisons him !
I'll give him some liquor .
I got him to leave , and made up an excuse for your trance .
She confessed .
But if you'd be willing to shoot another arrow the same way you shot the first , I'll watch your arrow more carefully this time .
Yes , sir .
The ground is brown .
I'm very sorry I was so hard on him .
Order them to move back .
Even her worst faults are charming , and holy priests bless her even when she acts the slut .
You're tigers , not daughters .
Why the nobles were imprisoned , and on what charges , I don't know , my gracious lord .
That's one of them .
You are a fool. , You , niece , prepare to leave .
My father's spirit is growing in me , and I won't take this any longer .
We'll be there , and there we'll rehearse courageously and wonderfully , truly obscenely .
That's how sound a man you appeared .
Good-bye then , until the time I see you dressed in your battle gear , which will suit you both very well .
Let me choose now .
Bolstered by righteousness , I prepared to fight , and when he saw my excitement , or perhaps because my shouting scared him , he ran away suddenly .
I'll either fight you , Macbeth , or else I'll put down my sword unused .
What are you doing here ?
He's busy , can't you hear him giving orders ?
I must be as stupid as an ass , that's why I don't know her , but she knows me .
I'll tell him the news .
Well , aren't you a good man ?
Yes , I do , lady .
Oh , my reputation , Iago , my reputation !
I've spelled it out for you clearly .
Angels are still bright even though Lucifer , the brightest angel , fell from heaven .
Well , I hope not .
No metal , not even the executioner's axe , could ever be half as sharp as your hatred .
I shall , King Harry .
My God , do you think I'm easier to manipulate than a pipe ?
Here I'm kneeling to swear that if I ever did anything to destroy his love for me , either by thoughts or actions , or if I ever took pleasure in anyone else , or if I never did love him , or don't love him now , even though he tries to shake me off ,
Our noblemen are battling bravely .
You've done well at sea .
I will accept no apology until experts in matters of honor show me how to make peace with you without staining my own reputation in doing so .
Hang him immediately .
Richard of York , how are you doing , my loving brother ?
He is a subject for a king to contemplate , and for a king's king to ride on , and for the world at large , both friend and stranger , to stop whatever they are doing and marvel at .
But even so , we can't do without him .
What a sad sight !
Well she was , good Curtis , before this frost .
Maybe I should ask you what right you have to take me , but I'll take you , Orlando , to be my husband .
If not , come when you have the courage .
With one cut you can be through paying money to Naples .
Can't you see I'm eating ?
It's the best thing to do .
that mountain of insanity that wants to marry me , I could find it in my heart to stay here and become a witch myself .
Was a man ever as dirty as me ?
I won't refuse you anything .
You , who are neither honest nor good .
I had no reason , no reason .
None of these deranged rascals can shake me from my profession .
She had no food today and will have none .
How literal this guy is !
We're not invading England out of ambition or greed , but out of love , dear love ! , and my father's right to his kingdom .
On a night like this !
Send the deed after me and I'll sign it .
Farewell .
Help !
Take me to him .
Good madam , be patient .
Lord Mayor , the reason we have sent , Look behind you !
Oh , Iras , Charmian !
So you got what you deserved , and were locked up in this cave , which is more fitting for the likes of you than a prison would be .
The more you beat me , the more I'll love you .
My brother thinks highly of you , and because of his affection , has helped arrange your marriage , but that was definitely a waste of his time and energy .
We are free from his tyranny .
A wise man and a fool .
Come inside with me , and I will tell you my plan .
Listen .
A good plan , warrior king .
Am I myself ?
We grew together like twin cherries , which seemed to be separate but were also together , two lovely cherries on one stem .
But I see you're troubled .
My sweet husband , I did not lock you out .
Play , I say !
Amen to that .
Will you surrender and avoid all this or be called to account for the destruction of this town ?
He and I will be there .
But in your daughter's womb I will bury them .
Damn my soul if these accusations are true !
Oh , Fate , come and cut the thread of my life .
The death of my father , my physical weakness , the loss of all my friends , the threats of this man who's taken me prisoner , all that would be easy for me to take , if only I could look through my prison windows once a day and see this girl .
Shall we go see this fortification , men ?
On a night like this , pretty Jessica , in a bad mood , said outrageously wrong things about her lover , and he forgave her .
Shush , sir , please !
Tell me , you monster , where is my son Lucentio ?
How old are you ?
Please stand up !
Please call him and tell him to come back here .
Kill Claudio .
You gentle Romans , Quiet there !
The young generation rises while the old one falls .
His nurse , grandmother .
Our action will seem too bloody if we cut off Caesar's head and then hack at his arms and legs too , Caius Cassius , because Mark Antony is merely one of Caesar's arms .
If you happen to see Horatio and Marcellus , who are supposed to stand guard with me tonight , tell them to hurry .
To hell with you !
Even though half of him is like a
Or rather , do what you feel like doing .
He's great-looking , but how can you talk to someone who doesn't speak your language ?
Who's there ?
I think I can find him .
The one who claims to be your wife just ran away from you .
Come on , you .
Look over your lines again .
So , the man would talk half as much as Benedick and be half as serious as Don John , And if he were handsome , agile , and rich , too , he could have any woman in the world , all he'd need was her good will .
Go to bed right this minute .
What a horrible world we live in !
Get yourself to a convent , at once .
You would have made me treat them like a tyrant. , I'm done , my lord .
I won't take it .
I think you're trustworthy one minute and then not the next .
Ask her to help you heal the rift between her husband and you .
Those who were bitter enemies of your father in his time have turned their bitterness to sweetness , serving you loyally and wholeheartedly .
Other countries criticize us for our loud partying .
You bastard workhorse drudge !
Give me your hand , Roderigo .
Go to Adriana , you scoundrel , and quickly .
But I think , I want to tell you the truth , and now that I think about it , I think this is true , I came here with Hermia .
Mistress , you have to go see your father .
Spread the rumor abroad that Anne , my wife , is very sick .
I have to ask you , as a favor , not to let on that you recognize me until the time is right .
Oh , not you again .
Yes .
I don't think so .
Wipe your eyes .
They're friends , Ratcliffe and Lovell .
Our handwriting gives away our hearts .
Do they seem religious ?
Oh , help !
What traitor hears me and doesn't say amen ?
What do you mean by that ?
What was the second noise for ?
I'm now sure that every bump in the road has been removed .
I loved wine and gambling , and had more women than a Turkish sultan keeps in his harem .
It's a good thing he's here to recommend himself .
Anger does not protect the angry well .
It would be a pretty stingy love if it could be counted and calculated .
What's the matter ?
Take on someone your own size : if you kill me , boy , you'll have killed a man .
Let's take a little walk in the orchard before dinner .
And don't we have passions , and a taste for fun , and weaknesses , just like men ?
Or walk either .
It was wild insanity to believe promises made by the mouth and not the heart .
You should be whipping yourself , since you lust after her and yearn to do the same thing for which you're punishing her .
Stay , Jaques , stay here for a bit .
Caesar's sister is named Octavia .
Enough .
I can't believe it." The tears fell from her eyes like holy water .
Liar and slave !
No , not for all of Venice .
All of you who are looking at her , wouldn't you swear that she's a virgin , judging by these outward shows ?
Your name is Lucentio , you say .
They can't have changed ; there's no way this could be true .
Why are you making them work so hard ?
I'm tired of this moon .
And make sure to carry a prayer book in your hand and to stand between two priests , okay ?
I'll keep your words of wisdom close to my heart .
Eighty ducats in one shot !
That's true , my good boy. , Come on , take us to that hut .
Now go , leave me .
You look tired .
I have already .
Because we were unprepared for the king's visit , we weren't able to entertain him as well as we would have wanted to .
And now , let's turn to our business with the French .
And his voice is the paramour of sweetness .
What looks like a horse is quick as thought disfigured by the wind , made as difficult to distinguish as water poured into water .
And those eyes were endowed with sight by Claudio , the Prince , and me .
Our knocking woke him up .
The thane of Fife had a wife .
Shake my hand .
I don't have the cash right now .
What do you think of this plan ?
Banquo and Donalbain , Malcolm !
She's alive .
We want Antony taken alive .
You both know Banquo was your enemy .
And in the morning I'll take you to your ship and we'll sail to Naples , where I hope to see this loving couple married .
Have you seen my lord ?
Isn't that true ?
Obey your parents , keep your word , don't swear , don't sleep with another man's wife , and don't covet flashy clothes .
You have to be patient , madam .
You're right , Charmian .
Even if I had sworn never to marry , I wouldn't trust myself to keep that promise if Hero would marry me .
Look , here's where Cassius's dagger pierced it .
The Queen is here , my lord .
That's what I said when I first conjured the tempest .
I demand this in the name of all the saints in heaven .
Stay away for now , and good night , my sweet friend .
Exactly like that .
Everyone there got a little crazy and pulled some desperate stunts .
Will you kill him then ?
Well , eventually God will send him some more hair , if he thanks Him .
Could you tell me how near the enemy is ?
Whenever they meet , there's a little battle .
He's in his chambers now , and he's extremely upset .
Make your boasts come true , and I'll be thrilled .
They still haven't joined the battle .
Shut up , you doddering old wizard !
I'll shut up now .
No wonder she's waiting to get married .
Do you honestly think , tell me , Emilia , there are women who'd cheat on their husbands in such a disgusting manner ?
I will not trade my horse for any that walks on four legs .
Yes , but these English are seriously short of beef .
Well , it certainly wasn't true for Richard !
When ?
Come on , I'll take you , but honestly I'm only doing it out of pity .
It looks like you've offended it .
Even for a Good morning , lieutenant .
How late is it , lords ?
Where are you going ?
The hand of death has taken him .
Bring me a bigger one .
The carriages , sir , are the hangers , where the swords hang .
You mournful princes and grieving gentlemen who have been sharing this burden of grief , now it's time to cheer each other up with love .
We follow in your orbit , and you have the power to move us .
The skin is good for your cracked head .
Wait , don't stand next to each other .
We have God and a good cause on our side .
This imaginary suitor for Katherina , I'd buy him the best horse in Padua if he'd get here quickly , woo her , marry her , take her to bed , and rid the house of her .
How did she get that candle ?
A friend would never see those faults .
This is a small house .
But if you fail , you have to leave immediately .
Then see the evidence of their evil with your own eyes .
We will wait on you , your majesty .
Strange and terrible events are all welcome , but I despise comforts .
No , Messala .
Yours are slow and awkward .
Oh , what a relief !
Who doesn't know that the good duke is dead ?
He's a king , a king !
No , we can just announce the actor's name , and let his face show through the lion costume , and have him say something himself .
We used to think so too .
I told you not to hang around my house .
If you get nasty with me , Pistol , I'll stab you with my sword , in fair play .
What was your dream ?
This isn't a good moment for jokes , save them till a happier time .
Sir , these accusations should be answered .
Ambition shouldn't be so soft .
His highness is not well .
Gentle Octavia , support the one that supports you .
I'll give you mine .
I didn't write about breaking the alliance with Antony until I saw you were being misled and realized how dangerous it would be to keep postponing preparations .
And be a happy mother by doing so .
It's dark , like my shoe .
When you are gentle , you shall have one , too , and not till then .
You can't see the future .
Yes , I do .
He's here , sir , but please don't bother him .
It's time to leave .
Does everyone kill what they don't love ?
Both you and the king might have ordered us to execute your command , instead of asking us so politely .
Let them come , I don't care .
But I say amen to everything she said .
He's quite simply the smartest working-man in Athens .
The cold wind's still blowing through the hawthorn tree .
He'd stay up all night and all day if he didn't drink himself to sleep .
Most mighty Caesar , give me some reason , so I won't be laughed at when I tell them so .
Good night .
I can't live by pretending anymore .
Yeah , right , you sent me to get whipped .
Oh , there's been a lot of quarreling .
What's that music ?
Our advance will so dazzle the enemy that England will cower in fear and surrender .
He's the color of nutmeg .
Quiet !
That was a poor unlucky beggar .
Read it , Mark Antony .
They wouldn't say anything ?
You keep cramming words into my ears that I don't want to hear .
Let's go , Tom .
What are you waiting for , lords of France ?
Well , time will tell .
Where do you live ?
In the meantime , come home with me , and when the time is right I'll take you to talk to him .
The three who share the known world are aboard your boat .
Let those who will hear me speak stay .
Are you going to Scone ?
Go get money .
Yes , be content , good Touchstone .
The will !
All right , then .
Are you blushing ?
Come with me ; I'll spy under the tents to see if any of my own people plan to desert me .
What , out in a storm in the middle of the night ?
In God's name , who are you ?
I'm afraid it will make you too hot , too .
I must go attend Caesar .
I have no doubt about that , since I know there isn't a man among us who isn't with me wholeheartedly , or a soul left behind who doesn't wish us success and conquest .
That's music to my ears .
I'll do well .
Are you really as in love as your poems declare ?
All the rest of the conspirators acted out of jealousy of great Caesar .
Oh , but these are our friends .
And is everyone who swears and lies a traitor ?
For God's sake , would someone bring me a mug of beer !
I'll leave you for now .
It's time to put our armor on .
Their hounds are unequaled in courage .
Here , sir !
It seems he has taken great care to please his wife .
Give me my fishing rod .
He's not standing straight enough to hold a flag .
Leave him alone .
This is our station .
If Cleopatra heard you , you would be well punished for your audacity .
I'm off to Venice .
What friend ?
No one's heard from him .
Thank you very much .
Wait , don't rush !
My own flesh and blood turned against me !
How are you going to live ?
It's not safe to be straightforward and honest .
Don't think of any beauty But the beauty of Rosalind .
Let's play .
Look , it's waving me over again .
I'm not competitive like Antony .
We need to stay away from each other until midnight tomorrow .
The sun will not appear today .
Double , double toil and trouble , Fire burn , and cauldron bubble .
Don't shed any blood , or cut less or more than exactly a pound of flesh .
Therefore , dear Isis , do the right thing and give him the fortune he deserves .
Again !
Though I wouldn't wish to be better for my own sake , for your sake I wish I were twenty times more than myself , a thousand times more beautiful and ten thousand times richer , just so you might value me more , so my good qualities , beauty , possessions , and friends would be more than you could calculate .
You shouldn't have to see the punishment we inflict on your father .
Very sad .
I'll read it. , It looks so unlike Portia !
Are you sitting around in this humiliation to amuse yourself ?
If not , then this parting was well done .
Tell them this , Publius .
Oh , these fools !
Why is that cauldron sinking ?
Your eyes look threatening .
You wake up to have fun , and you start work when you go to bed .
Goodbye !
Love ?
Me too .
See , the snail already has its horns , which prevents nasty rumors from spreading about his wife's infidelity .
With all my heart. , Three or four of you go welcome him. , In the meantime , I'll read Bellario's letter out loud .
You're a fool .
They let God see things they wouldn't show their husbands .
You know that Banquo and his son Fleance are still alive .
I will , sir .
You always know he's got some plan that pleases him when he says good morning with such gusto .
Whether you're a good spirit or a cursed demon , whether you bring heavenly breezes or blasts of hell fire , whether your intentions are good or evil , you look so strange I want to talk to you .
This is it , for now .
I'm not sure I can wait that long .
Come on , do you think I can't recognize you by your excellent wit ?
We'll bury him , and then we'll commit acts as brave and fine as any Romans , and make death proud to take us .
As far as I know , he's okay and will arrive here soon .
What would you have said , my young York ?
I'm not Stephano , I'm a walking cramp .
know myself !
I'll go look for him , Cassio , stay around here .
We're going to have an out-and-out brawl if I stay any longer .
You sell fish .
Why not !
The king isn't the one sending you to the Tower , Clarence .
We have enough supplies for it , and they've earned it .
Dear gods in heaven , what's the reason for this ?
Oh !
Come with me , and let's smother my fiendish son , who smothered your two sweet sons , in bitter words .
And I see her also through the eyes of love .
Take me off to jail ?
I can't talk about my happiness anymore .
My lord , if you have a free moment , I have a message from His Majesty .
Yes , my lord ?
I gave him the material .
Well , first there was the prince from Naples .
You take my house away when you take the money I need for upkeep .
So I'll stay here for a while .
How unlucky am I , having to apologize for doing the right thing !
I remember a jumble of impressions , but nothing distinctly .
What's up , daughter and niece ?
What do you think , will my friends prove loyal ?
That your interest payments are like Jacob's sheep ?
A reason ?
Signor Montano , your brave and loyal servant , gives you this information and asks you to send reinforcements to relieve him .
I love you dearly , Ariel .
Oh , dear God , please help him !
Now , I'll swear to the opposite , that the pancakes were rotten , and the mustard was fine , but even so , the knight wasn't lying .
I beg you not to do this , my lord .
Consider how young you are , and question your feelings .
But I need to remember I'm related to him by blood , not behavior .
Didn't you hear it ?
Oh Lord , who's that crying ?
Let me see , what do you think about falling in love ?
We don't know .
Try to get him to do that .
So will we all .
If you can think of a more awful title , I'll call her that .
Here .
You're so infatuated with him that you're hallucinating .
My lord , most humbly on bended knee I beg you to grant me the leading of the vanguard .
Look , he can become invisible .
So be calm .
If you really love me , you'll find me. , Nerissa and the rest of you , get away from him .
So will I .
Then why did you travel so quietly ?
He can sniff his way to Dover .
I didn't think I would see you here .
Sometimes snakes wrap around me , hissing at me with their forked tongues till I go crazy .
Oh , Tranio , what a cruel father he is .
You're less happy , being feared , than they are in fearing you .
Tomorrow night , when the moon shines on the water and decorates the grass with tiny beads of pearly light ( the time of night that always hides runaway lovers ) , we plan to sneak out of Athens .
That's not how I do business .
Don't think I'm so dumb that I don't know that the devil himself won't eat a woman .
But the enemy is loud .
We have kissed away entire kingdoms and provinces .
We're men beached on the sand , hoping to be washed out by the next tide .
I'll reward you for your troubles .
Choose another tack .
I tell you , I feel very jolly remembering such a beautiful dream .
Yes , you are .
We told him we wouldn't even let him bury his men until he retreated to Saint Colme's Inch and paid us ten thousand dollars .
This ring , sir , oh no , it's nothing .
I'll forbid all ships from leaving our harbors .
Stop , if you can't be kind , at least have some shame .
If I ever have to ask you for something that will put your luck to the test , it'll be something difficult and terrible .
And you must think people are stupid if you believe they wouldn't realize all the motives you have for trying to kill me." Oh , how monstrously evil !
I see a woman may be made a fool of if she doesn't have nerve enough to stand up for herself .
Yes , let's do that .
What's more , people at the
I'll run away from you and hide in the bushes , and leave you to the mercy of wild animals .
And yet I do love you .
Oh , my lord , my lord , forgive my panic !
Stay !
I wish your Highness knew my true feelings in this matter : I have never in my life loved my brother .
Lorenzo , that's for sure , and I'm also sure you're my love , who else do I love so much ?
Nobody ever set a gem like her in a worse setting than gold .
We're wasting time here .
But I still believe that his madness was caused by unrequited love. , Hello , Ophelia .
I swear on my soul it was a lie .
Then pack up your instruments and go away .
The general got rid of us early tonight so he could be with Desdemona. , I can't blame him .
So you'd better not stay with him , Antony .
To die , to sleep , to sleep , maybe to dream .
There's your boyfriend , sleeping right over there .
down , and then say also that in Aleppo I once saw a Turk beating a Venetian , so I grabbed the Turk by the throat and hit him like this .
You've won .
It's like half your soul's been ripped out .
He brushes his hat in the mornings .
I'll flatter anyone who flatters me , though what I've accomplished on land can not be denied .
That's the one .
I'd like to sing my song solo .
Oh , Antony , don't beg us to kill you .
Handkerchief , confessions , handkerchief !
I believe it .
Let the ship sail close to the wind .
We have two hours to get ready .
That's always true .
And here's Regan , whose grotesque face betrays her twisted heart .
I've got news , boys , the war's over !
Listen !
It's a green-eyed monster that makes fun of the victims it devours .
Don't joke about his predictions .
His wife probably did it on purpose because she knows what kind of fits he's having .
I won't either , sir .
The Queen will be treated fairly if she gives me up ?
He's staying in the forest with your father now .
Damn her !
What's the matter , husband ?
Upon my life , my lord , I'll do it .
Think of your sins .
Good Cinna , take this paper and be sure to lay it in the judge's chair where Brutus sits , so he'll find it .
Indeed , they say my uncle grew so fast that he could gnaw on a crust of bread when he was two hours old .
You say he's friendly with Caesar , healthy , and free .
May He bless you , too .
Don't insult me with your distrust .
Until then , I'll walk around town , peruse the markets , and gaze upon the buildings , and then I'll return and sleep at the inn .
Welcome , destruction , blood , and massacre !
Who in the crowd is calling me ?
That's him .
Now come along .
Tell me , if your dark powers can see this far : will Banquo's sons ever reign in this kingdom ?
If this letter's right , you've got a lot to deal with .
Yes , let's go to sleep .
Calphurnia !
I wrote a verse to this tune , though it's not very imaginative .
He's crying out for you and swears he'll burn your face and disfigure you if he can get ahold of you .
The people are on my side , and I'm in charge of the sea .
What should I do ?
Oh !
Order him to advance his forces first thing , and we'll follow .
In a way" is the right way to go .
Come here , good Volumnius .
There's meaning in your snoring .
If we crown him , I have to admit we'd be giving him the power to do damage .
Just let me follow behind you , even though I'm not good enough for you .
Oh , how awful that a lady who's been rejected by one man should therefore be treated horribly by another one !
No doubt , but you may be going about it the wrong way , Neighbor , this gift is very gracious , I'm sure .
Into God's hands .
Me too .
The king is virtuous and kind .
Although I can't make his ship disappear , I can still make his journey miserable .
Damn those men shouting down there !
I know because I dreamed of money bags last night .
So , what hour of comfort have I ever had in your company ?
You know that we parted only seven years ago , in Syracuse .
I'm ready to suffer peacefully whatever he does to me in his cruelty and anger .
But please tell me , sir , is your marriage Let him do his worst .
He's without equal !
How do you do , sir .
I'll take you to a place where you can speak freely .
Let's follow them to see how this turns out .
Tell me , is your tardy master close at hand ?
Follow" ?
But if you die before I return , you'll have made a mockery of my efforts .
But before they reached us-let me say no more !
What can I tell you ?
I'll watch this play .
Take out your sword .
Your honor is the reason you are leaving .
Sir , is it possible that a person could fall in love so suddenly ?
Lovers , it's time to go to bed .
Once I've put my rackets to these balls , I'll play a set in France , God willing , that will knock his father's crown right out of the court .
While we're talking here , a royal battle could be won and lost .
What do you mean by "furniture" ?
If he has a face like yours , a good scratching couldn't make him look any worse .
If this isn't what you've been hoping for , I have no more to say except that you ought to say goodbye to Bianca forever .
Antonio and Shylock , both of you come forward .
He started it , my noble lord , and succeeding generations rebuilt it .
The world has become so bad that now little wrens have settled where eagles used to roost .
To repay her for her troubles , Death Gives her undying fame .
And listen !
So pardon him , dear father , for my sake .
What , are you dead , my dove ?
He doesn't long for the dawn as we do .
Is there anything offensive in it ?
Help !
If you survive , I'll live .
Cicero is dead , by their decree .
Every subject's duty is the king's , but every subject's soul is his own .
Let's go .
Yeah , and he's going to tame her .
Give me a kiss .
Who's coming here ?
And yesterday the night owl sat hooting and shrieking in the marketplace at noon .
Let's go !
Good Mr. Mustardseed , I know you very well .
That'll keep them from being afraid .
Never !
Gentlemen , we won't stay here and anger you further .
Chop off his head .
Have you told him all her faults , Hortensio ?
Listen to me , good brother .
Will you be crowned tomorrow ?
You are welcome here , as are all of you English princes .
Bring me face to face with Macbeth , that devil of Scotland .
Bring me some light , gentlemen , I'll bind the wound with my shirt .
You said it right , old mole .
He said that the people weren't used to being spoken to except by the What blocks of wood !
Don Pedro is here .
Why , sir , must he ?
That makes Lady Courtesy a traitor .
Therefore , depart , and leave him here with me .
Thank you .
They'll set their watches to whatever time we say .
I don't remember .
He loves them both .
Gentlemen , gentlemen , Gentlemen , don't speak .
Any villain in Denmark is going to be , well , a villain .
Well , in and of itself , it is a good life , but given that it's a shepherd's life , it's worthless .
Our poor father , Clarence !
Nah , I don't care what their
Here's another , stronger than the first .
Yes , I'll go .
All this conversing has turned men into tongues , and fancy ones , at that .
Or any of you ?
I swear , at the moment I really couldn't tell you how I ended up here .
But if you had to say something nice about me , what would you say ?
If you want to pick a fight , you'll have to find a more substantial excuse .
Because my name is George .
But his kindness was nobler than even his desire for revenge , his natural goodness was stronger than his need to give his brother what he deserved .
Have you not spoken to her since then ?
Stop right there , sir .
He doesn't speak Latin , French , or Italian , and you know how little English I speak .
No more than that , my lord .
What has the governor of the town decided ?
Stop whining , devil .
If it were me , I'd be very upset too .
Give my regards to Hastings , Catesby .
A worthy fool !
So don't advise me .
This man said , sir , that Don John , the Prince's brother , was a villain .
Then I'll tell you .
Good day to you , sir .
Our master and mistress are looking for you .
It wouldn't surprise me , my lord .
I should have waited to tell you my news .
Damn it !
Since you're old and respected , you should be wise .
Pretty , Cupid-like boys stood on either side of her , smiling and cooling her with multicolored fans , which seemed to fan the flames in her cheeks even as they cooled them , undoing what they did .
Look : Benedick is so pale , are you sick , or angry ?
This is unbelievable !
My heart , which dried out with grief , will surely break apart into a powder , and that will be the end of my disgusting mind .
Please forgive me if I'm mistaken , my lord , but I can't keep quiet when I think you're being insulted .
No , he has only a little beard .
I'm here , full of anger , to complain about my daughter Hermia. , Step forward , Demetrius. , My lord , this man , Demetrius , has my permission to marry her. , Step forward , Lysander. , But this other man , Lysander , has cast a magic spell over my child's heart. , You , you , Lysander , you've given her poems , and exchanged tokens of love with my daughter .
What else did you hear ?
Caesar's talking .
God give him health .
I've almost missed the time he requested .
She has been in a man's bed .
And when the mind is engaged , the rest of the body , dead and dull before , wakes up and comes to life with a new nimbleness and sensitivity , like a snake shedding its dead skin .
Let me come clean .
My wife and I ordered him to hang Cordelia in prison and then to make it look as if she committed suicide in despair .
Do you want to exchange fathers ?
So let me sleep next to you .
You gave that handkerchief , the one I loved and gave to you , to Cassio .
Oh , sir , the problem goes far deeper than you realize .
It's our destiny , like death .
It's a bad time for such an injury .
No , cousin , I'm going to Fife .
I'll send goblins out at night to work their nasty deeds on you .
Caesar's better qualities exist in Brutus , and we will crown him .
I dreamed the souls of the people Richard murdered came to my tent and promised me victory .
I just saw your father the Lord Gloucester and notified him that the Duke of Cornwall and his wife Regan will stay with him here tonight .
Good night then , Casca .
Can't help it ?
That wicked Jew got the duke to listen to his complaints .
Nearest his heart." , Those are the very words .
Since she belongs to me , I can do what I want with her , as the law says : I can either make her marry Demetrius , or have her killed .
But aren't you drowned , Stephano ?
But he told me to get lost and threatened to hit me , kick me , even kill me .
My words are dull .
But I paid attention to where Cupid's arrow fell .
No , it's certain , Iras .
Whenever you like .
By next week , I'll be able to pay you .
Brother , I'm giving you good advice .
Anyway , how are you , Jessica ?
Captain Macmorris , if you take my words in some way other than how they were meant , see , I'll have to think you're not treating me with the good will you ought to , see , since I am as good a man as yourself , both in the practice of war and in my country of origin and in other respects .
Just let me say one prayer !
No , he loves and cherishes me .
You've come right on time .
I wouldn't allow any commerce .
Either Charles or some prettier thing has mastered you .
What time is it ?
That she did .
Get her attention and draw her home with music .
He didn't ask questions , but answered ours at length .
Give him your arm .
Why , how could she have been murdered ?
Indeed , sir , it is .
Why should we do this ?
You have no reason to say that .
Yes , sweet Rosalind .
Picture the cabin boys climbing around the rigging .
I didn't order it .
It was a rough night .
If you remember your life before you came here , you may also remember how you got here .
Thank you , I'm sure .
Well , good-bye , Portia .
She was a hellcat in school .
More , please , more .
I'm going to stand so I can see him pass on the way to the Capitol .
Isn't that your habit ?
Honestly , she is too ill-tempered .
Edward Plantagenet , why are you dead ?
So I Your Honor's actors , hearing of your recovery , have come to perform a pleasing comedy for you , and your doctors approve wholeheartedly .
You are building your nest in
We're at your service , my lord .
Is Clarence dead ?
Heaven wanted Rosalind to have these gifts And me to live and die as her slave .
So much for our plan .
Let lightning spit fire !
Thanks , my dear lord .
Beware of the devil .
My king says this : "Tell Harry of England : though we appeared dead , we were only asleep .
It has leaked out that you're hiding here .
My own flesh and blood rebels against me !
Hey , you !
There were no primary ones .
Even the traits that become me most kill me when you don't approve of them .
You can trust me .
My lord , how are you feeling ?
In the meantime , be patient .
Why did you cry out in your sleep ?
I think it's better to call it off .
No , you're just reminding me of something I've also noticed .
Come on , let's go to prison .
Come , lady ; you must die in order to live .
Follow my mother .
Regan , is that what you said ?
The sweetest nut has the sourest rind And Rosalind is that kind of nut .
Which of you has been complaining to the king that I don't like them ?
I knew him when he would've walked ten miles to see a well-crafted suit of armor ; now he spends ten nights awake in his room designing himself a fancy new jacket .
If Caesar chose , Antony would jump at the chance to be his friend .
Tell your men as much .
I'm going to let him live .
I was born as free as Caesar .
Do that , my friend .
It was yours , I swear .
Go tell the king I want to talk to him for a few minutes .
Did you say all ?
By God , I am not selfish when it comes to money : I don't care who eats at my expense .
Yes , indeed they are .
Who , me ?
He stayed like that a long time .
Caesar resents me , but he loves Brutus .
Oh , I wish I could know what will happen today before it happens !
What time is it ?
The king has bet six Barbary horses , and he has prepared six French rapiers and daggers with all their accessories .
Othello ?
Your magic spell has such an effect on them that if you saw them now , you'd feel sorry for them .
He'd really be your proxy if he married you .
No , I am a Welshman .
It's only four o'clock now .
Speak .
You are all Lord of lords !
Oh , horror , horror , horror !
No , before !
I told him to come back and talk to me in a bit , and he promised he would .
They call us drunks and insult our noble titles .
Thirty-five or thirty-six of his knights met him at the gate , and together with some others they've set off for Dover , where they claim to have powerful friends .
Upon the king !
Dorset has fled to the earl of Richmond .
Look , here he comes .
Enough of this .
You're going to die .
Good-bye to you , the last of all the Romans .
What heir of the York family is there alive other than myself ?
He can't bear his grief and so he's losing his mind .
Actually , I'm still feeling some pangs of conscience .
When will he be here ?
Why , no , boy .
Tell our top commanders that I want tomorrow's battle to be the last we fight .
What else you do know ?
Give me your first , Mr. Mustardseed .
He ran out that way , sir , when he couldn't , Follow him , now !
God , that song's even better than the other one .
No , not for all the world .
But that's just a fairy tale .
Now I'm starting to pity Titania for being so infatuated .
Drowned ?
So that means she'll come .
No , lady .
We'll meet Macbeth there .
Just watch !
No , the man who can not extol the virtues of my horse from dawn to dusk is not particularly clever .
Leave .
I used to love you .
I know when a man is on fire , he'll swear anything .
Do you think it would work ?
Any strange beast there can be considered a man .
I tell you , there are good men born at Monmouth .
You should know this : much luck is on my side , and my enemies have happened to wreck their ship on this island .
And women .
Why are you adored ?
Come , last of my friends , rest on this rock .
What's that , my lord ?
Oh , dear God , don't let me go mad !
Undress the statues if they're decorated in honor of Caesar .
My lord , my life is as important to me as yours is to you , and it was never as precious to me as it is now .
Yes , as you and the rest will find out as soon as he's home .
Why don't you have a seat , your highness ?
Am I sorry that I only had one child ?
St. George loses his holiness once Then , by myself , You've misused yourself .
Beat ,
Be angry whenever you like , it's all right with me .
Come , and you can have a queen .
No , by Saint Jamy , I'll bet you a penny !
Not good ones , please .
But , sir , Why should you do this , you want to know ?
Oh , kill me !
Companions in sorrow alleviate our grief .
We are men , my lord .
Oh , you streetwalker !
Yes , we get the idea .
He's still sleeping , ma'am .
Where did he go ?
If our criminal master gets off free , I won't care what happens to me anymore .
Well , well , well .
How dare you serve it to me this way !
You're in trouble either way .
No , not a penny .
Back when I was a schoolboy , if I lost an arrow I would try to find it by shooting another arrow in the same direction , watching the second arrow more carefully than I had the first .
I wish I had two fool's caps and two daughters .
It's nice you're offering to sacrifice her behind her back .
By the light of heaven , no , I would not !
The "passionate" duke ?
We age and die because they wear us out .
And me too .
Oh , sun , I will never see another one of your sunrises .
Hasn't he proven himself to be a great villain , slandering , scorning , and dishonoring my cousin ?
You can't do that .
Brother Anthony ,
How dangerous to have this madman on the loose !
He loves to hear me tell him how men can be snared by flatterers , just like unicorns can be captured in trees , elephants in holes , and lions with nets .
And I for Rosalind .
You can't go any further with us , sir .
Hello , do you have any news ?
Where's your sparkle now ?
I'd do anything to bring them back together , since I really care for Cassio .
Your daughter and son-in-law .
Well , the tree bears rotten fruit .
It's yours .
Bring the villain forward .
Oh , come on. , Come here , sir .
Is Horatio here too ?
Do this immediately , and don't stop searching and interrogating until you've brought home these foolish runaways .
What's this song ?
Why did Cassius conspire against Caesar ?
Knock , knock , knock !
This is what happened : he and Cleopatra sat on chairs of gold on a silver-covered stage in the marketplace .
Or should I describe you as the one who killed her brothers and her uncles ?
You're not one of Pinch's patients , are you , sir ?
What's this , my lord ?
That's my brave lord !
But once he got there , the duke learned that Lorenzo and his lover Jessica were together in a gondola .
What did he say ?
Oh , did he ?
I am a man again .
For you , I give myself away and I'm ecstatic about the exchange .
But you should hurry anyway .
Good .
Then stay with us .
You talk to him , ma'am .
I'm very afraid of Banquo .
What , did you cheat on us before we deserved it ?
My lord , your promise of the earldom , Richmond !
And why does Lysander deny that he loves you , when he loves you so deeply ?
Look !
When she was dying she gave it to me and told me to give it to my wife when I got married .
Do you want to know the truth ?
Oh , Regan , she's torn me apart with unkindness , like a vulture , right here .
I pray that the mighty gods defend you !
There is nothing distinctive , nothing remarkable left in the world .
I tell you I requested that your master cut out the gown , but I didn't ask him to cut it all to pieces .
Four legs and two voices , a very special monster .
Is he really married ?
When I meet this gentleman , I'll tell him what you've said .
Hush , Grumio .
Our tolerance for slavery and oppression shows us to be weak , like women .
Oh , I followed something I'm ashamed to look at now !
Sex and marriage are honorable things , even for a beggar , right ?
That's unbelievably bad .
Yes , and I'll do everything I just said .
I wasn't expecting you , and I'm not ready to receive you .
Our fate depends on this chance .
But not for long ; Charles will take care of everything .
Find out what this villainous Edgar is thinking , Edmund .
There'd be no work .
Do you love me ?
You don't really love me .
He bids them good morning with a modest smile and calls
I'm afraid my Thisbe has forgotten her promise ! , And you , oh Wall , oh sweet , oh lovely Wall , you stand between her father's property and mine , you Wall , oh Wall , oh sweet and lovely Wall .
He's married to Octavia , madam .
That part of his reputation will stand .
That's the point .
Was that the Caius Cassius that I knew ?
I'm tired of you .
Many people faint when they see blood .
Did Cicero say anything ?
I have a lot to tell you about them .
He's definitely drunk now .
You drunken slave , I sent you for a rope , and I told you what to do with it .
Or if you haven't sat as I do now , boring your listener with all your lover's virtues , then you haven't loved .
No , you'd answer , "The slaves are ours." And that's just how I'm answering you .
Montjoy .
Come , come , you are too clever for your own good .
I'm not sure , but I don't think so .
In a king , the sight is unbearable .
I will go find him .
No , please , speak seriously .
And tell the Dauphin his joke will look pretty stupid when thousands more weep than ever laughed at it .
What did he say the symptoms were ?
First of all , my house in the city , as you know , is filled with expensive furniture and household articles , china and gold , basins and pitchers for her to wash her dainty hands in .
If you look closely at Alexander's life , Harry of Monmouth's stands up fairly well by comparison , for there are analogies in everything .
Take care .
You should tell Antonio what you hear , but don't do it suddenly , because it might upset him .
Come to my cave and tell me the rest of your story. , Good old man , you are as welcome here as your master is .
Shall I accompany your Grace ?
What dangers are you trying to lead me into , Cassius , that you want me to look inside myself for something that's not there ?
It's too bad that Antony's fault should make you look like a jerk .
What do you say ?
Good lady , don't be angry with the child .
If there are any , speak , for it is he whom I have offended .
Go .
Oh , a thousand times worse , a thousand times , and what a sweet personality she has !
Come talk to me tomorrow as early as you can. , Come with me , my dear love .
But quiet .
Regarding the Dauphin , you can speak to me .
Tie him up like a thief and bring him here to me .
The villain won't escape .
The kind that tells you that the Moor is having sex with your daughter right now .
Not in my husband's nose .
Your husband knew about everything .
Hello , beautiful Helena !
And in public too .
Speak to us .
Your praise has beaten you home .
If Hamlet makes the first or second hit , or gets back at Laertes by making the third hit , then let my soldiers give him a military salute .
There's no crab-apple here , so don't look sour .
I'll do that , because I have to tell my brother how you forgave him , Rosalind .
Quickly , quickly , good Iras , quickly .
Shouldn't I say , "Does a dog have money ?
I've never been more useful to you than I will be now .
Killing men in the dark ?
Who has wronged him ?
I came here with a fool's head on my shoulders and now I'm leaving with two. , Goodbye , sweet lady .
The money you owe me for the necklace .
That's good , Lion !
He seems cheerful .
I'll take a look at your letter .
I'd kiss you before I spoke .
Sit down for a while , and we'll tell you again the story you don't want to believe , about what we've seen two nights now .
Here , noble lord .
Are you a god , an angel , or a devil , that you make my blood turn cold and my hair stand up ?
I'll pay you .
That's me .
But a dream itself is just a shadow .
I'm forty-eight .
He is definitely not there , sir .
You evil thief , where have you hidden my daughter ?
No , Pompey , I haven't had anything to drink .
There is no better one on earth .
Don't kneel , noble Portia .
where it takes on some other horrible form that drives you insane .
Stanley , Richmond is your wife's son .
Ah , but there is , Horatio , there's a lot of offense .
It's bitterly cold out , and I'm depressed .
Lord , how you've changed !
By all that's holy , here comes Katherina !
Good husband , come home soon .
I haven't done anything wrong .
Will it eat me ?
I'm no villain .
Now you have only the memory of what you were , which tortures you when you consider what you've become .
Look how she rubs her hands .
Yes , that's all true , but what do you mean by it , my lord ?
Then we'll call this the Battle of Agincourt , fought on the day of Crispin Crispianus .
What a poor , gullible monster. , That was a nice big gulp , monster !
Cassio's been wounded .
Your statue spouting blood through many holes , in which many smiling Romans bathed , means that you'll provide great Rome with sustaining blood , and that great men will strive to get some token of approval from your holy blood .
I like the morning .
I didn't kill Lysander .
From now on this is what I'll think of your love .
I will confess it to all the world .
He intends to do something bad to you .
Gone ?
Look !
Call him over here , good Monsieur Le Beau .
Hurry , Messala , and I'll look for Pindarus in the meantime .
No , most likely .
Sir , be a man .
Why , that's my dainty Ariel singing now .
The gods are fair , and they use our little vices to punish us .
They say the horses ate each other .
Go back , slave , or I'll knock you one across the head .
Be patient , because you're staying with me .
Yes , Shylock , I'll sign the contract and agree to its terms .
Revise your statement , or you may damage your inheritance .
It's time to hide , wretched Margaret .
What else ?
Give me your blessing .
The powerful dukes Gloucester and Buckingham .
I say a devil .
And you can do poor things that lead to rich results .
How are you doing , brother ?
Sir , he left his belongings and treasure .
Oh , except for the widow Dido ?
To find you .
He's still sharp when it comes to carrying out a bold or noble enterprise , though he puts on this show of stupidity .
Yes , or to wear cosmetics ?
Cram your good news into my ears .
I suspect that I have committed some offence to the city and you have come to reprimand me for not knowing better .
I'm going to England .
Now from head to foot I'm as firm as marble .
Farewell .
You are my love , my love , I think .
Portia is dead .
Are you out of your mind and deaf too ?
You'll make me angry .
I'd hate to see you drowned in honey , sir .
It bothers me , though , that these poor spotted innocents , who , after all , are this deserted city's native citizens , should be gouged with arrows .
Well sir , good night .
I surrender your dukedom and beg you to forgive me all my crimes .
This guy here has banished two of his daughters and blessed the third one without intending to .
Oh sweet mistress , speak !
Therefore , willingly and yielding .
If you get what you want and you're still not happy , you've spent everything and gained nothing .
Let's go to this great feast .
What's wrong ?
I hear someone coming .
What , are you going to mock me to my face when I told you not to ?
I swear , she's a very good-natured lady .
You're like the poor cat in the old story .
It wouldn't let my soul find its way to air but smothered it inside my gasping body .
Your superiors .
If your vengeful heart can't forgive me , here , take my sword and bury it in my heart so that my soul , which adores you , can be free .
They said they were acting for you .
I doubt it's anything but the obvious reason : his father's dying and our quick marriage .
When I strike , I'll cry , "All or nothing ! " Well put .
Very pleased to meet you , my lord .
Where is she ?
He picked out the letter "G" from the alphabet and said a wizard told him that "G" will take the throne away from his children .
Sneaky , dried-up old coot !
The more I suffer , the more spiteful he becomes .
Tell her that the king , who has the power to command people , asks her .
I feel awful for my cousin .
Go away and take your children .
With one little toss of his head , He can scare you off for good .
Meanwhile , after you .
And it's definitely better to cry because you're happy than laugh because you're sad !
Richard Earl of Cambridge , I arrest you for high treason .
Here lies Hero , The heroic maiden killed by slanderous words .
Well then , don't bother .
This is a lowlife who basks in the reflection of the fading glory of the woman he works for. , Get out of my sight , scoundrel !
Are you kidding ?
I'm Sir Rowland's middle son , and I bring you news .
Her fallow fields are overgrown with weeds , while the blade that should uproot such wilderness lies rusting .
Which plays , what music ?
She was previously Caius Marcellus' wife .
And now she'll start moaning , of course , Are you asleep , my love ?
Sir , welcome to our house .
Quiet !
You wrong me in every way .
I'll ask only Benedick to come with me , for from the top of his head to the soles of his feet he's a joker .
Leonato's daughter had told us everything .
And if anything important happens , find me and let me know .
Take up my mistress ' gown for his master's use !
What's going on , Horatio ?
I don't really want to do this , but he's given me good reasons .
Then I'll water all those precious herbs with my tears to make them grow .
Have you forgotten the horrid witch Sycorax , stooped over with old age and ill will ?
What are your names ?
Come with me .
Not one , my lord .
You're not going , sir .
There may be a time for everything , but no man who has gone bald naturally can get his hair back .
Let him run far away .
I'd prefer to keep my mistress rather than some lame horse .
Come and see the proof .
To get what you want , you need to get Cassio out of the way .
Bassanio , we'll say goodbye for now , since you've found Antonio .
How would you woo her ?
If you do that , I'll never respect you again .
Then love me , Rosalind .
His eyes were as green as leeks .
I'm happy about that .
I'll tell him , my lord .
What did you mean by giving me this handkerchief ?
No , boy .
And so the Jew may lawfully claim a pound of flesh nearest the merchant's heart , to be cut off by him. , But please have mercy .
Is he losing his mind ?
Oh God , remember to hear her prayer for them , just as for us !
You can see my ribs so well you can count them .
Locked in her tomb .
But still , my uncle-father and aunt-mother have got the wrong idea .
Then , at my farm I have a hundred milk cows , a hundred and twenty fat oxen in my stables , and all the equipment necessary to maintain them .
Sir , sir , calm down .
And I'll use that piece of rope to welcome you with .
I will never be exhibited as lucky Caesar's prize .
Neither will I .
And I'll sing it for the duke in the intermission of a play .
Good morning , neighbor Gremio .
Are you trying to remake me ?
If there's enough wind for a ship to sail out tonight , I won't spend tonight in this town .
The spirits that know the future have told me this : "Don't be afraid , Macbeth .
He's dead and rotting in the dirt now .
Oh , Antony , you extravagantly generous man , how would you have rewarded me for serving you faithfully when you reward my badness with all of this gold !
Yes , my lord .
If you're Launcelot , then you're my own flesh and blood .
Come on , you're drunk .
Now is the time when we need your help .
Dromio , you drone , you snail , you slug , you idiot !
My mind is too great for that .
All those memories pain his mind so deeply that guilt and shame keep him away from Cordelia .
I would rather be a country serving maid than a great queen if it meant I could escape your scorn and constant harassment .
Thomas Grey , knight , of Northumberland , I arrest you for high treason .
Do you want to get married , fool ?
There are rats and thieves and pirates , not to mention storms , winds , and rocks .
to wage war .
Take your penalty .
Now we wear the wreaths of victory on our heads .
What a man ! , especially compared to my husband .
And then his clerk , who went to a lot of trouble with the writing , begged for mine .
That's great .
Sir , my king , don't waste your time mulling over how strange this business is .
Don't get wound up , my good man .
No , of course you don't .
Goneril would go crazy if I chose Regan , but it would be hard to get in with Goneril while her husband's still alive .
Birnam Wood .
It was love that performed these miracles .
Here's a sick man who wants to speak with you .
Oh no , sir , I won't let him go , sir , not without a good reason .
Yes , I do .
I could have blown up the town in an hour .
break out , civil war erupts , kings are betrayed , and the bond between father and son snaps .
Your crown is crooked .
then I hope I have a life of misery !
No more than a minute ?
Read it .
I guess now she's going to be my sister-in-law and not my wife .
Edmund , you deserve me to be your woman .
Goodbye , Jessica .
Who's taken over the watch for you ?
Hey !
Get some light !
He'd begged me to steal it many times .
Don't go near Casca .
A little before twelve , I think .
Nothing .
Help me !
What kind of fighting cock is this ?
But how ?
So he's dead ?
Its own color .
They say you are a melancholy fellow .
Go to him from me .
I'll look for some way to leave his service .
Now , my sweet lord , you know how much I like you .
Sir , do you recognize this glove ?
I swear that nothing anyone can say will change my mind .
Let me borrow a mirror .
Go ahead , use your authority .
Yes , it's definitely nippy .
If he's reluctant , I can convince him .
And if you're not as attentive in serving him as you used to be , that'll be good .
I'd swear to you on my soul that she's a good , honest person , sir .
Mark Antony , Pardon me , Caius Cassius .
You have a noble wife who is much more beautiful than any other woman in this declining age .
Come on , music !
They're overdoing it .
She shall be buried next to her Antony .
No , if you can't adjust to political changes , you'll suffer for it .
I never saw a woman except her and Sycorax , my mother .
Maybe it's an English tailor who liked to skimp on the fabric for people's clothes .
It fell on a little western flower , which used to be white as milk but now has turned purple from being wounded by the arrow of love .
Either be calm and polite or I'll drown you out with the music of war .
Me too , otherwise I would have had to duel with Claudio .
Did you hear a noise ?
I spoke with some of the sailors who survived the wreck .
Tut , tut , you've become rather icy .
I can tell by the way you waggle your head .
I'll knock your teeth out , sir .
Oh , you excellent young man !
I've been invited to supper , Jessica .
So please , my sweet Rose , my dear Rose , be happy .
Do it immediately , or all your previous services to me were accidental , without purpose .
I'll wear this one and none other .
Are you familiar with the case currently before the court ?
You're brave gentlemen .
Tell me what you did with the king's ship , the sailors , and the other ships .
Frightening looks are also at my service , as are fake smiles .
Oh , do not wish one more !
I hope you are pleased with the snake .
Madam , his majesty asks for you , and for you , Duke of Gloucester , and for you , my noble lords .
I think I do .
I know you for what you really are , but as your sister I'm reluctant to criticize you .
As for Hamlet and his attentions to you , just consider it a big flirtation , the temporary phase of a hot-blooded youth .
You're Forgive me , Signior Gremio , but I'm anxious to get things moving .
You can't trust anyone who abuses her own father , her flesh and blood .
We'll see our husbands before they even have a chance to miss us .
Join your witchcraft with your beauty , and let Antony's lust combine with both .
They're certainly a peaceful couple !
Very true .
Pay him six thousand and cancel the debt .
Here's mine .
I swear by Jupiter I'll never revoke this punishment .
Yes , I am .
Where's Publius ?
From Silvius , sir .
It must be .
And as surely as I am alive , I am a virgin .
I must go in .
They haven't been commanded to go to the west , mighty king .
No , you're just taunting me .
The battle on the sea is almost lost .
It's him !
Let this evil hour be marked forever in the calendar as cursed .
Nobody's that bad .
Is this true ?
You and I have heard our fathers talk of another Brutus , your ancestor , who would've let the devil himself reign in his Roman Republic before he let a king rule .
I'll tell you , Cassius , you yourself have been called greedy and been accused of giving your positions to undeserving men in exchange for gold .
Or had a friend who would be a man for me !
I have no gift for the one and no strength for the other , though I have the gift of strength .
Either here or at the Capitol .
Then come to my house tomorrow morning , and since you couldn't be my son-in-law , be my nephew instead .
Can you hear me ?
Oh , sin can disguise itself so artfully !
Stop , for God's sake !
I admit two sleeves .
Caesar , I have news about Menecrates and Menas , notorious pirates who prowl the sea in a variety of ships .
I swear , I love you .
What's that sound ?
Even What , were you all snarling before I arrived , ready to catch each other by the throat like dogs , but now that I'm here , you turn your hatred toward me ?
Is the king awake , worthy thane ?
Then both my grief and your sorrow will be cured .
Now , good-bye .
My lord , this bill that's being proposed is the same one that was proposed in the eleventh year of old King Henry's reign .
This is the silliest thing I've ever seen .
But I beg you , don't interpret my suspicions as slander against you .
Sure I can , father .
This is Antonio , my dearest friend .
In that case it's your imagination that's interesting , not the play .
Yes , yes !
Is it gone ?
Perhaps a woman's voice may do some good when some small detail proves to be holding things up .
What handkerchief ?
Yes , leeks are good .
I myself heard the king say he would not be ransomed .
No , I've had my say .
Let's go to the king .
Farewell .
The duke will drink under this tree. , He's been looking for you all day , you know .
She seemed to be trying to control her emotions , which were overwhelming her .
That word "judgment" makes me feel a bit guilty .
Yes , that's the one .
As soon as the deed is done , you will be in my favor and I will promote you .
I don't want to play now .
I believe you are , Regan .
Hail , king !
And if he advances unopposed , my lord , let us abandon France .
Give me some trinket of yours , and I will wear it in my hat .
Very impressive .
Not very well , but I've met him several times .
Tell the army to flee .
I mean , what do the words say ?
Really , he's very witty , and full of wise sayings .
Someday you can get revenge. , Oh , you bastard !
Second , he must make a will here in this court that leaves all his property to his son-in-law Lorenzo and his daughter when he dies .
Like a fire that gets covered up , Benedick should smother his love and waste away .
Yes , I remember .
Here is the door , sir .
If we aren't relieved in an hour , we have to return to our barracks .
Who's this Adam you speak of ?
I see a voice !
Neither my husband nor the slave has returned , even though I sent the slave off running .
Which is either a fool or a nothing .
Yes , but he'd deny it all .
Did you send for him , sir ?
Yes , of course .
Find out who did it !
I can't , my lord .
I said you had a fine wit .
Take that , and that .
Oh , I'd rather have met my fiercest enemy in heaven , Horatio , than have lived through that terrible day !
Quiet there !
Besides , his cottage , his flocks , and his grazing rights are on sale now , and since he's not there , there's nothing to eat at our house .
For what favor ?
Mighty duke , look here and see a man who's been treated most terribly !
I've got no food to give you .
First rehearse your song from memory , and make sure each note is pretty .
Tell us , old Egeon : are you the man who once had a wife named Emilia , who gave birth to two fair sons ?
Richard is looking cheerful today .
I doubt you'd thank me in the end , but she's rich , all right , very rich .
Right now ?
We'll do what you want us to , my lord .
Is that why you're talking so wildly ?
It's a big prize for such a small sin .
And even then , in order for me to catch the fly your cousin , she must be blind ?
I could not forget you , since I never saw you before in my life .
Have I accomplished so much in battle , but now I'm afraid to tell some old men the truth ?
But tell me , which of my good qualities first made you suffer love for me ?
Lead's too crass to hold her .
Go , coward that you are .
Let me go , I say .
To Baptista Minola's house .
Instead , hide your true face behind smiles and friendliness .
What kind of beard should I wear for the part ?
So be it .
Very humid , I can't tell you how humid it is .
Let me embrace the father of Lucentio , and then we'll journey on to see your son , who will rejoice at your arrival .
Friar !
Give me an almanac .
Yes , I have great cause to be thankful .
Make her sterile and dry up her womb so that no baby will ever come out of her body and honor her .
Oh , make them joyful !
Hey , open the door !
Look at all the devoted servants who work for their masters their whole lives for nothing but their food , and then when they get old they're terminated .
But I'll stop rebuking you .
Sir , he ate with this woman at the Porcupine .
Why are you enraged ?
Therefore , in case he does , we must hold him back .
What is it , Biondello ?
You'll find I'll give it to you very willingly .
It's time to end it , good lady .
Heaven knows what secrets she's keeping .
Are you talking about the crown ?
I'm not staying here to argue anymore .
The wiser the woman , the wilder .
Sweet mistress , I don't know what other name to give you , or how you've figured out mine , you seem as
Norfolk , we're going to have a few blows , right ?
And now you toss flowers in the path of Caesar , who comes in triumph over Pompey's defeated sons ?
Please , tell me more .
By this sword" is an oath , and oaths must be kept .
Don't be afraid .
You're right .
So , there's the signal to ride .
Tell me .
Hail !
Your eldest daughters destroyed themselves and died in despair .
Gentleman , I am not the same man I was before .
Not a chance !
Don't be upset .
I was .
The gods know how dearly Caesar loved him !
Master , I'm all tied up for you .
Indeed I do , sir , and I've come to let you in on a certain problem .
Oh , you devil , you devil !
Good friends , go in and have some wine with me .
But , tell me , is young George Stanley alive ?
Get away from me , you ass !
Are you serious ?
Our country weeps , it bleeds , and each day a fresh cut is added to her wounds .
I've wanted to see you for a long time now , but I sent for you so hastily because I need your help right away .
No , I won't give my medicine away to anyone but the sick .
It's nearly dinner time , and the night's going to be wasted .
My dear Regan , your sister's not worth anything .
It doesn't excuse your cruel behavior .
I knew him when he listened to nothing but the military drum and fife ; now he would rather hear the sweet and refined music of the tabor and pipe .
Caesar , the clock has struck eight .
So take me to see them .
Yes , better than you know me .
What about Falconbridge , that young English baron ?
Advancement to some scaffold , to lose their heads .
That he was never trained as a soldier .
My husband said she was unfaithful !
Like an invitation .
Or is he walking ?
First , you have to speak to the watchmen who accused them .
I've been looking all over for you .
May God give their souls rest .
I can see in your eyes there's been some good news .
How many wonderful creatures there are here !
He's got my vote as I die .
Yes , mother , but I wish I hadn't .
Help !
I like it better than laughing .
I can't find it .
Did you kill him , then ?
What , isn't my mother coming ?
I will have it all mine .
Am I in France ?
The noblest men who ever walked on leather have walked on my handiwork .
What's the trouble ?
I'll leave you now to chatter and gossip like an old woman .
Oh , Fate , come , come to me , with hands as pale as milk .
Tonight in Harfleur we will be your guest ; tomorrow we'll march on .
It's a subject as worthy of endless discussion as the changing sea .
I've told you everything I know .
Did you hear that ?
If her breath steams up the glass , then she's alive .
I know this quality in you , Brutus , it's as familiar to me as your face .
We have And one of them is the criminal Deformed .
Where are you going ?
What do you think , Norfolk ?
Well , it's not for me to say .
If you can love me for this , take me .
Antony .
A friend .
Once there , make your thoughts work harder , and witness a siege .
It's a good tragedy , very well done .
Now , now , both of you gentlemen !
Ah , he got you back , Benedick !
You just said they had to face her .
Don't follow me .
May you only give birth to male children , because your fearless spirit should create nothing that isn't masculine .
I have done wrong , so I will suffer wrong .
Help me .
Count Claudio , when do you plan to go to church and be married ?
Thomas , the earl of Surrey , and he were moving from troop to troop around twilight cheering up the soldiers .
It takes a wise father to know his own child .
Charles , I thank you for your loyalty to me , and you'll see that I'll reward you .
Where could I have lost that handkerchief , Emilia ?
When you just want to eat , it's better to do that at home .
Yes .
Quiet , everyone !
And he challenged you to a duel ?
You have absolutely abused our sex in this love talk of yours .
Oh , goodbye !
As you know , next Sunday my daughter Katherina is to be married .
We're not going to run in our army , Monsieur Monster .
Name him .
Unkindness is powerful , and his unkindness may kill me , but it'll never destroy my love .
So goodbye until we meet again .
Actors can't keep a secret .
Two great enemies , in fact , enemies to my peace of mind .
Wake up , wake up , ring a bell and wake up all the snoring citizens .
Where are you going ?
Get up from your beds as if you were rising out of your own graves , and walk like ghosts to come witness this horror .
We must not .
You are not as happy as Macbeth , yet much happier .
And my poor He's fainted. , My lord , my lord !
Oh , be quiet .
Gone , sir .
You know , I saw the Duchess of Milan's gown , the one that everyone praises so highly .
Ugh !
So , I won't .
I've transferred Richard's body to a new grave and on it poured more tears of remorse than it has shed drops of blood .
Call the messenger in .
Go get Aliena ready , because , look , here comes my Rosalind .
Now , by St. George , my knighthood , and my crown , The first you profaned , the second you dishonored , and the third you stole .
Oh , has it come to this ?
They're louder than the storm or us sailors .
The king wants to speak with Cornwall .
I beg you to continue to be patient .
Farewell .
It is rather cold , indeed , my lord .
There's no masquerade tonight .
I almost recognize that voice .
I'm sure you aren't Launcelot , my boy .
You haven't lost it unless you think you have .
Look , they're crying .
But one word more , He will not be commanded by you .
Armed forces have already landed .
What , is trusting a friend such a crime ?
Pretty York , who told you about his teeth ?
You can't trust all the rumors .
Your behavior is an insult to all women .
What are you talking about , man ?
But goodbye .
Let's go forth , dear countrymen .
Let's hear what Antony has to say .
This lantern represents the moon .
That's a wise idea .
This is rebellion .
Why do you say that ?
Follow me if you're brave enough , and we'll fight over Helena .
No , don't throw any of it away .
Don't let her say I kept you .
I'll tell my husband what you've said , Launcelot .
You seem like a good judge .
No , my good knight .
You , sir , where's my daughter ?
I chose her for my wife when I thought I had no father to ask advice of .
I'll leave you , lady .
Yes , you're absolutely right .
Go get my best clothes .
Oh , my brave Emperor , this is what I call a fight !
You haven't heard of the war brewing between the Dukes of Cornwall and Albany ?
A sense of security opens the door to conspiracy .
Up here you can't even hear the waves crashing against the rocks .
I don't understand , how should I answer that ?
C'mon , I might as well say the fool's the fool !
Has he , sirs ?
No .
To cut my penalty from that bankrupt man over there .
Fierce civil war will paralyze all of Italy .
God forbid !
Learn to see better , Lear , and let me stay here where you can look to me for good advice .
As I vowed , I will unite the York and Lancaster families .
A good name .
My dear lord , you know how passionately stubborn the duke is .
Come with me , my dear Cordelia .
But if a man becomes weary of these obstacles , he can always kill himself .
Eat and sleep .
There's a cliff there that leans precariously over the deep sea .
Strike !
Then the liars are fools , for there are enough liars in the world to beat up the honest men and hang them .
But don't be too tame , either , let your good sense guide you .
Someone who can ride fast , go to the duke of Here , my good lord .
He's hot-tempered , and he might try to hit you with his staff .
One voice speaks well and talks about his friend .
Let's be sacrificers but not butchers , Caius .
Both , both , my girl .
I ordered that the sleeves be cut out and sewed up again , and I'll prove it in combat even if your little finger is armed with your thimble .
It's meant in good will .
I would've been a sore king then .
It's Casca , I know your voice .
I'm not scared of you .
It's Brabantio .
I think this country is so kind that if it weren't for
Laugh at the power of other men , because nobody born from a woman will ever harm Macbeth .
His knights are getting out of control , and he himself reprimands us about every little detail .
We thank your Honor .
Where is his body , Messala ?
Oh , dear .
What , do you think we're Turks or savages , instead of Christians ?
Nothing that you want to hear , my lord , but nothing so bad that I can't mention it .
He refuses to admit what everyone else knows .
It'll help us more than hurt us .
Oh , I see .
I did .
Not for a second .
You see that any morals she has left are preventing her from denying the charges : she doesn't want to add perjury to her list of sins .
But before we reached the end point , Caesar cried , "Help me , Cassius , or I will sink ! " And just as Aeneas , the hero who founded Rome , emerged from the fires of Troy with his elderly father Anchises on his shoulder , so I emerged from the Tiber carrying the tired Caesar .
This haunting business is even stranger than murder .
I believe I have some choice in the matter , sir .
She's only sad when she sleeps , and not even then .
Be wise when you criticize me and keep your minds alert so you can judge me fairly .
I am their father's mother .
Whatever has already been done can't be undone now .
Bring your master home .
Can we do that ?
Are you so patient and forgiving that you're going to let him off the hook ?
I think it was at sea .
Two hundred ducats .
Why stay when love tells you to go ?
Do it , and shout like the city's on fire .
And leave you out ?
Don't think I blame you .
Drunk ?
Sweet saint , for goodness's sake , don't be so angry .
Because I'm a Jew .
But , oh , heavenly Rosalind !
As freely , son , as God gave her to me .
Very well .
It was the most ruthless massacre this country has ever been guilty of .
What's up , my man ?
You belong to her .
But if I really laid him bare , I'd have to weep and hang my head , and you would not believe me , his behavior is so shocking .
I ask you , if you've kept this a secret , keep doing so .
Your father would be a fool to give you all his wealth and spend his declining years as a guest in your house .
I am ashamed that women are so foolish as to declare war when they should plead on their knees for peace , that they seek authority , supremacy , and power when they are under an obligation to serve , love , and obey .
If that's all , gentlemen , I see no problem .
And like I am for no woman .
Calm down .
He was an admirable king .
You may come across better food , but not a warmer welcome .
We've driven him all the way back to his camp .
I tell you , you can use it to get your shoes fixed .
Well , when I cut the egg in half and eat the whites , the yolk will be in two parts like two golden crowns .
I'll drink to Hamlet's health , and into his goblet I'll drop a pearl even more costly than those in the crowns of the last four Danish kings .
Every one of us is a criminal .
No , we'll all go there to bring him .
No one except her maid and a holy hermit .
Fierce , fiery warriors fought in the clouds in the usual formations of war , ranks and squadrons , until the clouds drizzled blood onto the Capitol .
Well , then , that's how it is .
Run off , go visit fairs and festivals !
I swear to God you're accusing me wrongly !
Yes , my master .
Hurry. , Oh , love , if you could only watch the battle today and see how expert I am at my craft .
Have you ever heard of anything like that , Roderigo ?
This bigmouth jerk here , ( He'll still die by hanging , not drowning , even if every drop of water in the sea tries to swallow him .
You've stunned him .
Please be careful .
Who is this fool ?
Did you talk with him ?
I'll recognize him all right , I'm sure of it .
Sir , this is the truth : you and the rest , all the people who have ever talked about her , have all been wrong .
You told me you hated him .
I've gotten it dirty , ashes to ashes , and dust to dust .
So that she may live , I'll say I cheated on Edward and that she is not really his child .
Why is my lord enraged against his love ?
My friends , listen .
If you want to read it , as I haven't heard it yet , though I've heard too much of Phoebe's cruelty .
It was some devil .
No , it's a story .
Where are the noble Hastings , Rivers , Vaughan , Grey ?
The enemy approaches with great display .
You were a cold crumb on dead Julius Caesar's plate when I met you .
Oh , I'm dying , Horatio !
I have money in my purse and property at home , so I'm off to see the world .
Please , be cheerful .
Signor Bassanio !
Where do you want me to go to respond to these charges ?
All the spirits hate him as much as I do .
I'll help you through this business .
Good luck .
I'll make her come right away , I promise you .
You're appealing to a son who hates you .
Why don't you go away for a bit ?
What do you say ?
Therefore , drink up. , Servant-monster , drink a toast to me .
You who are so skilled in cursing , stay awhile and teach me how to curse my enemies .
The clock's just striking twelve .
Until the day we die , my lord .
If he had as many lives as he's got hairs on his head , I would've killed them all in revenge .
What is it ?
And what are you going to do with it ?
I never saw her till now .
So , the sun won't shine today !
If we don't obey them , they'll suck the life out of us or pinch us black and blue .
Now , we go contentedly to freedom , not banishment .
Please , I'm asking you , go ahead and get back to your state affairs .
Where ?
Well , good night .
He's my prisoner .
Quiet !
All right Ursula , as Beatrice arrives , we'll be walking up and down this alley and speaking about nothing but Benedick .
You're a fool .
The crown was offered to him three times ?
I'm leaving now .
Great God of heaven , say amen to all this !
What would you say to me now if I really were your precious little Rosalind ?
What wicked magician has conjured up this devil to interrupt this sacred burial rite ?
If you mutiny against me , I'll hang you from the next tree .
Something there isn't a word for .
Who's in there ?
These are a man's words , and his handwriting .
It was just like in real life , dark brown with silver whiskers in it .
It's an outstanding army and highly motivated .
Pray God does some surgery on you : you need to be fixed .
That's what he says .
Enough of your magic spells , you hateful , withered hag .
Your Majesty is quite right .
Queen of Egypt , greetings !
And so , my words and thoughts will be at odds .
Well , I won't take it any longer .
Damn it !
And he's made the holiest vows to me , to back up what he says .
I'll lie here tonight .
He almost begs for the opportunity to help you .
But as I said , the general isn't really in the mood to hear music now .
Look around you , Caesar .
Isn't he an honest man ?
Their lips , like four red roses on a stalk , touched .
Listen !
Dolabella , I will always be in debt to you .
Oh , no !
But here's the plan : our army will stay with us on the hills by the city .
Will it be in thunder , lightning , or rain ?
Oh , what a bloody end to all this !
Sir , I must get that diamond ring back from you .
Yes , and these .
Curse you all , you're all murderers and traitors !
Right now you swear to me that you are a virgin ; if you were a poet , I might have some hope you were lying .
To celebrate a marriage of true love , and give a gift to the lovers .
No , don't be ashamed , Cleopatra .
I was killed in the Capitol .
Who's there !
Go , blockheads , go , and bring my supper to me .
What income , what profit does it bring in ?
Could that be a lawyer's skull ?
Well , explain , but do it fast so that your puny store of kindness isn't used up by talking about it .
What should we do about that ?
He's a lord to a lord and a man to a man .
Conspiracies , fakery , betrayal , and disorder are all that's left until we die .
If you want to come have dinner with me , you can .
Please give me a little credit !
I never caused her any harm , as far as I know .
Orlando , do you really believe that this boy can do everything he's promised ?
It's the last command I shall ever give you .
It's true .
Tonight I'll throw through his window a few letters in different handwriting , as if they came from several citizens , all testifying to the great respect Romans have for Brutus , and all alluding to Caesar's unseemly ambition .
Then we can all three be comrades on our way to France .
Trinculo , speak politely .
If he's so sad and solemn when he's young , I can only imagine how much he'll cry as an old man .
No , by Our Lady , I'm not such a fool to think what I please , and I don't please to think what I can , and in fact I can not think , even if I could think my heart right past thinking , that you are in love or that you will be in love or even that you can be in love .
The king and the prince are praying .
I don't know how .
Yes , you already hurt me in the church , in the town , and in the fields .
I had business that made me late .
Come with me , I'll show you , and along the way , you can tell me where you live .
Ah , I've got it !
Are you all good and honest men ?
He does nothing but frown , as if he wants to say , "If you don't want me , I don't care." He doesn't even smile when he hears funny stories .
We shouldn't displease him .
It's a lie , you thread , you thimble , you measurement !
Even the fiercest wild animal has some touch of pity .
Merciful powers , keep away the nightmares that plague me when I rest !
No epilogue , please .
Let's go .
A friend should put up with his friend's weaknesses , but you exaggerate mine .
I haven't eaten today .
It eats and sleeps and has the same five senses we do .
The people fear me in the country and the town .
Tell me , Voltemand , what's the news from the king of Norway ?
Will our army cut a swath through the fighting force of France , achieving and accomplishing everything I've assembled them to do ?
I think it's important .
Was it you that he rescued ?
It would be inappropriate , dangerous , even , for me to be seen working against the Moor , as I would if I stayed .
Tell us how it happened , noble Casca .
Let me refer to a proverb that may help you forgive these lovers : if you can't change something , don't cry about it .
Are you insane , old man ?
It's this servantlike mentality that's keeping you unmarried .
Please , don't mention her .
I'm going to go drown myself .
Is Cassius nearby ?
I recognize his walk .
Stop that alarm from ringing , it's scaring the islanders .
His arrival fits perfectly into my plan .
Your life is stretched to its limit .
Cambio is transformed into Lucentio .
What's his name ?
Then tell them to treat us well .
Listen , in books they say that true love always faces obstacles .
Oh , gods , make me worthy of this noble wife !
When we're faced with a wretched person , bruised and crying with hardship , we try to get them to shush up .
For more important things , you'll say no .
We'll hit him on the head with the handles of our swords , then throw him in the wine barrel in the next room .
No , madam .
You would make a nasty suitor .
I swear he's the better dog .
If you choose the one that contains my picture , we'll be married right away .
Goodbye , my Desdemona .
Welcome to Rome .
And Rosencrantz !
Titania sleeps there sometimes at night , lulled to sleep among the flowers by dances and other delights .
Yes , it truly is .
May the gods bless you .
You know , uncle , A sparrow once raised a cuckoo in its nest Until the cuckoo grew up and bit the sparrow's head off .
And even if they don't , at least Hero's supposed death will stop the rumors of her infidelity .
You defend yourself by blaming my judgment , but you're just making up feeble excuses .
Oh , but there's one more thing to tell you .
Bow to him , fairies , and curtsy to him .
Tell us your name , sir , truthfully .
That was a likely story , that you found it in your room and didn't know who it belonged to .
Neither of them would take anything but the two rings .
He is made of treachery , and has run away to avoid his crimes .
I'll give Thank you , darling .
I will , my lord .
Yes , Caesar ?
Yes , even power gets in its own way .
If you want to cry over my bad luck , I'll give you my eyes .
Let me see .
What's the matter ?
Then let Octavia dig up your face with her nails .
Oh , lieutenant !
Here , sir !
My lord , I will give them all they deserve .
If he backs down , he'll become as notorious a villain and as saucy a Jack as ever walked on God's earth , in my opinion .
Favorably , except that there wasn't enough time for his Grace to hear , as I sensed he would have liked to , the details about how he is rightfully entitled to certain dukedoms in France , and to the throne of France in general , through clear lines of descent originating with his great-grandfather , Edward III .
How are things now ?
You're a bitter fool .
But you're lying out in the cold .
For a while , no play was sold to the theaters without a big fight between the children's playwright and the actors playing adult roles .
Think about it carefully .
Watch her .
I've already sent the proof in my letters .
And have I ever seemed less than modest or appropriate to you ?
Noble Antony , even illness couldn't keep me away .
Follow that gentleman now , and be careful not to make fun of him .
But if you see a wheel going uphill , latch on for the ride .
That too .
Just tell me .
You can't party your way into dukedoms there .
And you're my husband , right ?
There's my hat !
There's a time for all things .
Whenever I mention him , praise him more than any man deserves .
I charge you , in the name of God , be careful what you say .
When I could see , I didn't always see clearly .
I don't deny it .
And earth !
I like your new wig and headdress , though I'd like it more if the hair were a shade browner .
I think the marriage was made more for political reasons than for love .
That was me , but it's not me , I'm not ashamed to tell you what I once was , since I'm so happy to have since converted .
Good morning , neighbor Baptista .
If it pleases you , your highness , will you lead us all inside ?
The news I have to tell your majesty is that Buckingham's army has dispersed from sudden floods and heavy rainfall .
All I can hope for now is a share of the feast .
And when I get my reward , I'll get out of here .
When I've revealed my true identity , you'll be glad you took the time to help me out .
If she's lying , I pray that I never sleep again at night or wake up during the day .
Keep your promise , my love .
He wants to be crowned .
Give me your hand , Leonato .
Goodbye .
The next day we had our fight at sea , and you know what happened after that .
And I believe , unless this brain of mine is not so politically cunning as it used to be , that I've found out why Hamlet's gone crazy .
As his body grows uglier with age , his mind rots away as well .
There is no indication of the mighty army that surrounds them in his expression , nor has the long , sleepless night robbed his face of an ounce of color .
But I'm overjoyed !
Kind gentlemen , I won't forget the trouble you've taken for me whenever I think of this day .
Yes , you're speaking very well .
Tell her that I've been arrested and the money will be my bail .
From the time I was seventeen , over sixty years ago , I have lived in this house , but now I will live here no more .
I'm not possessed !
Let's lay everything upon the king : our lives , our souls , our debts , our anxious wives , our children , and our sins." I must bear responsibility for all of it .
An enemy to tyrants and a friend to my country .
Because their business lies outside the home .
You should listen to reason .
Never .
Damn you all !
If you weren't a man , then what kind of animal were you when you first told me you wanted to do this ?
This , this All-Souls ' day , is my just desserts .
He followed the old man .
You need to .
Make a bug show of mourning for her , hang sad epitaphs up at your family's tomb , and perform all the appropriate burial ceremonies .
Like the Oh stop it , you lusty bed-hopper .
Really , I think your other ruff is better .
That's him .
Put out your torches .
Go release them , Ariel .
They were lusting after each other .
Well , I'm nearly finished .
If not , it's true , this parting was well done .
I don't understand why she's not locked up .
Good night to you both .
That's like hot ice and strange snow .
I bet it will .
Tell me the truth .
Snap out of your daze .
I'll arrest him .
Thus far has our straining author pursued the story with his crude , inadequate writing , keeping important people penned up in this little room while he mangled history's full glory with his uneven telling .
You've won the wager , and I will add twenty thousand crowns to what they owe you .
How can you top that ?
But let him start off easy by killing one of us .
He's subhuman , like an animal .
A soothsayer tells you to beware of March 15th .
What crimes have you committed to be sent here to this prison ?
I know that she is worthy of that love .
Labio and Flavio , push our armies onward .
I have a good reason to cry , but my heart will splinter into a hundred thousand pieces before I let myself cry. , Oh , Fool , I'll go mad !
The gods forbid !
Look at you , thrashing about like a blind man .
Oh , yes I am , father .
It's women crying , my good lord .
Quiet !
It's a big deal to you .
Quiet !
jailer , i'm your prisoner .
He's dead .
Next month he'll stay with us .
This is beyond weird .
It's a deal !
Go ahead , rage till your proud heart breaks .
Not if you want to keep your arms !
The size of my sorrow must be as great as its source .
When he woke , he wouldn't know where he was .
Caesar wrote for him to come to Rome .
Everything's fine , now , sweetheart .
But thinking like this won't help me choose a husband .
That's right .
You'd better understand that I won't wait till I'm chained up in your master's court , and I won't let myself be scolded even once by dull Octavia .
Please forgive and forget .
Because when rich villains need poor villains ' services , those poor ones can name the price .
A thing of no importance .
I'll wait patiently .
But what love could make my Lysander leave me ?
You have a daughter named Elizabeth , who is virtuous and beautiful , aristocratic and full of grace .
Goodbye to you both .
There's nothing to fear in him .
It's all stopped .
How did he get such an idea ?
The jewels you took from me to deliver to Desdemona would've made even a nun want to sleep with me .
But will my Rosalind do this , too ?
A drunkard or a corpse ?
Wait , Petruchio , I should go with you .
She stood trembling , then suddenly dropped dead .
You don't know my voice ?
Speak .
He was dressed so oddly too !
I asked you again , and you scratched your head and stamped your foot impatiently .
While I was looking for a flint to light it , I found this paper on the window , sealed up like this , and I'm sure it wasn't there when I went to bed .
Have they come back ?
I'm almost ready to break down hearing this much .
Why do you look like that ?
Is that you , Iago ?
Oh , to think you've been rejected !
I can't make up for everything that I'd like to , so accept such kindness as I can offer .
How nice of you !
No , no , I'm as ugly as a bear , since animals that see me run away in terror .
But we'll obey .
God bless my old master .
Oh sir , I accept .
And after that he came back here looking so serious ?
Separate them .
No , longer than that .
At Pembroke , or at Harfordwest in Wales .
Horrid villain !
Where's Monsieur Mustardseed ?
If he shows up tomorrow , I'll give him what's coming to him .
Okay , who does it trot for ?
What do you think ?
Since if the sun breeds maggots on a dead dog , kissing the corpse , by the way , do you have a daughter ?
How long have you believed in astrology ?
What am I , a cane ?
If you choose that one , I'm yours , along with the picture .
We can't waste time between now and six o'clock .
Gentle cousin , let's go thank him and encourage him .
Please go to him , my friend .
There is much to be learned from these converts .
I hope you think I'm faithful to you .
Not me .
I , sir , am Dromio .
With no more ceremony than that ?
Oh , who did this thing ?
Have you mangled my tongue so badly in these seven short years that my only son can no longer recognize my weak , sorrow-ravaged voice ?
Do you really mean that ?
I'm amazed you got here before me .
Your fall has left a blot that opens even the best and brightest to suspicion .
He rejected my authority as much as yours .
I never felt it until now , two thousand ducats in that diamond , and other precious , precious jewels !
I need to be alone with my thoughts for a while and don't want any company .
Yes , he's the one who first told me about her .
Give me that letter , sir .
Are you going to start eating worms and flies ?
And keep yourself hidden , I command you .
It's unbelievable .
Tie him to this chair. , You'll see , criminal , By the gods , it's disgraceful for you to pull my beard .
That it was , sir .
Musicians , play us a song. , Prince , you look sad .
It's nice of you to remind me .
Why would you have me betray the truth of my emotions and make my love wander in some other direction ?
Which of you two ate lunch with me today ?
And so will I .
Sir , Octavius has already arrived in Rome .
Oh , I'd kill that bastard Cassio forty thousand times if I could !
Even though Birnam Wood really did come to Dunsinane , and I'm fighting a man not of woman born , I'll fight to the end .
So you had time as you were dying to look around ?
I don't know whether he fought on Norway's side , or if he secretly aided the rebels , or if he fought with both of our enemies .
Bad news , my lord .
Were you thinking of spending the night here ?
He's starving me to death .
No medicine in the world can cure you .
Who can stain that name with a just accusation ?
You've said what you have to say now .
Here comes Antony .
And has anyone ever won her , as I've done ?
How dare What , is the man crazy ?
Cheer up !
Yes , the duke of Buckingham and I have just returned from visiting him .
What horrible thing are you imagining ?
Not the time I saw it .
Naked , " he says .
Lord Edmund didn't speak to your master at home ?
Tell me !
You know me well .
An annoying schoolboy , unworthy of such an honor , joined by a masquerader and a partier !
No , he's in Florence .
Eat .
It's proper that we speak first , which is why we sent our proposals ahead of us for your consideration .
And how , out of your great heap of knowledge , will you manage to prove that ?
But don't expect any more than that .
Then please , put off your eating for a little while I , like a mother doe , find my fawn and bring it food .
Little birds do it , and dragonflies copulate right in front of me .
What do you think ?
I won't allow it .
Don't be cruel , Demetrius .
Are you satisfied , Jew ?
I'll see her like this .
My gracious lord , I should tell you what I saw , but I don't know how to say it .
Good morrow , neighbor , whither away so fast ?
He was like a schoolboy who finds a bird's nest and happily shows it to his friend , who then steals it from him .
I would have my own brother arrested if he treated me so terribly .
Why , do you know of any harm intended toward him ?
That's for sure .
Your wife and brother led troops against me , claiming to be fighting in your name .
I know that my hour has come .
If you see me without it , you can be confident I'm dead .
No , not until we see a hot January .
I have made your daughter mine by marriage while false impressions blinded your eyes .
Dead .
I'm afraid his mother may have had an affair with a blacksmith .
What do you want ?
When you begged to stay , that was the time for words .
I'll have glory in this losing day , more than Octavius and Mark Antony will gain by their foul conquest .
Forty thousand brothers , if you added all their love together , couldn't match mine .
But you're too good a friend for me to wish her on you .
I don't know that , once he knows what I know .
When he opens his wallet to give us our pay , your conscience will fly out ?
Oh , sir , impetuous people learn their lessons from the consequences of their foolish actions .
The leftovers from the funeral dinner made a convenient wedding banquet .
Or else their guardians and advisors said no , What hell , to have your love life determined by someone else !
Give him a noose to hang himself .
He's trembling in his fit !
As a favor to I'm delighted .
Roderigo's been killed ?
He says I won't get into heaven because I'm a Jew's daughter , and he says you're irresponsible because by converting Jews to Christianity you're raising the price of pork .
Make room !
Call up your courage .
The Egyptian snake is born when the sun shines on the Nile mud , just like the crocodile .
Well , give me the worst news .
It's revolting !
Good-bye , my dearest sister , good-bye .
I am arrogant , vengeful , ambitious , with more ill will in me than I can fit into my thoughts , and more than I have time to carry it out in .
It stands by her bedside .
What's your name ?
It's just that my wit is very gentlemanly , Margaret , and refuses to hurt a woman .
Little pitchers have big ears .
Please , do so .
Now , I swear by Apollo, By Apollo , King , you're taking the names of the gods in vain .
What , even you , Brutus ?
Soon all my work will be done , and you'll be free .
There's no scarier wild bird than the living lion , and we should remember that .
We hope your poison has worn off and this day shall transform all grievances and quarrels into friendship .
Dear sister , it's unfair to me , and unfair to yourself , to turn me into a slave .
Okay , but when ?
This treachery of yours is like the second
Here comes the man himself .
Do I have the asp's poison on my lips ?
Myself ?
Be calm !
He who chooses me will get what he deserves." I'll assume I deserve the very best. , Give me a key for this one .
Let him go , Gertrude .
Do you know what Caesar intends to do with me ?
Who do you want to work for ?
In our case , our bad neighbors over their make us early risers , a healthy and sensible thing to be .
Not that we love words more than fighting , like you do .
No , not me , sir .
He's a devil , a born devil , who can never be trained .
Show .
My ships will come home a month before the money is due .
You'll get there two days before me .
If our general had been his old self , we would have won .
There's good reason to escape when there's no mercy to be found anymore .
Maybe you think that I think you're in love .
Poor lady , she'll go crazy when she sees it's missing .
I had no idea she was cheating on me .
Anyway , go tell your master I am here .
And how did you get in here ?
Oh !
Spoken like a brave man who respects his reputation .
When they feared death , they escaped with their lives ; and now where they imagine they're safe , they perish .
I'll get you for that .
Me too .
No more of these thoughts .
That's well spoken .
Soldier , why are you wearing that glove in your cap ?
You left him out in the storm in the black night , bareheaded , a storm so terrible that if it had happened at sea , the waters would have risen up and extinguished the fire burning in the stars .
To tell the truth , Gratiano , you're giving your wife a valid reason to get upset .
The original story was written in the finest Italian .
More or less .
But it can't help either !
That's true , if the devil's judging her .
Then where would you have me go , Adam ?
Wait , madam .
Who is so low that he wouldn't ?
Goodbye , Edmund .
By the future .
Where is that knocking coming from ?
I'll do it right away .
Not explicitly , but so what ?
Get me some poison tonight , Iago .
There's no other way .
Oh no !
There was never a mother who suffered so much loss .
It's still waving to me .
I won't hurt him .
They can't move till you release them .
He would have gotten a pension of six pence a day for his whole life .
I didn't have the heart to say no to him .
Go immediately , and do exactly as I wrote down .
But , go on .
If you have tears , prepare to shed them now .
Well , you're a liar , then .
And you haven't heard any news about her in your letters ?
Once she exclaimed , "Sisters , sisters , shame on you !
Now all the young men of England are inspired and have stored their party clothes in the closet .
All right , we'll see you at dinnertime .
Oh , this is treachery !
Oh , monstrous !
How are you doing , Cassio ? , Someone bring me a stretcher !
Whom should we look for in the castle ? , Whose job is it ?
Let the rain spray !
The French are still fighting .
But you heard him swear up and down that he was .
What kept you from telling him this ?
If you're the ones setting my daughters against me , don't let me be foolish enough to take it lying down .
Let me go .
That awful , plodding rhyme sounded like a row of dairy women stomping off to market .
He was perfect in everything .
You've got something for me ?
What's the matter , lady ?
And though I wouldn't dare to swear that you love me , still my blood begins to flatter me that you do , despite the ill effects of my face .
But my daughter should know about this , so she can be prepared with an answer just in case .
What kind of crude jerk are you ?
Report back to him fast and tell him what has happened .
If you could only hear this testament , which , excuse me , I don't intend to read aloud , you would kiss dead Caesar's wounds and dip your handkerchiefs in his sacred blood , and beg for a lock of hair to remember him by .
You know that the style of a man's jacket or hat or coat means nothing .
Can you tell me whether Rosalind , Duke Senior's daughter , has also been banished ?
Then let's go in and hear what he has to say , though I think I can guess before the Frenchman has uttered a word .
I'll be back quicker than you can think a thought .
I am sick and sullen .
But what's this I see ?
If it is , I suggest you don't eat it .
I will , my lord .
Oh , she could sing a wild bear to sleep !
The Count sent me an excellent pair of perfumed gloves .
Please , marry us .
Any obstacle or barrier to Claudio's happiness will be like medicine to me .
I won't .
And she is very smart .
Can't Lord Stanley sleep ?
Look how flushed the actor is , with tears in his eyes .
No way , then , I'll run .
Tonight is for celebrating !
And so do I , my lord .
This wicked man will be brought face to face with Margaret , who I believe was hired by Don John to take part in this plot .
Likewise , our common men lie drenched in the blood of princes , and their wounded steeds , ankle-deep in gore , struggle and , raging wildly , stamp on their dead masters with their hooves , killing them a second time .
Trinculo , watch out .
Now I've done a good day's work .
So take your last breath .
Buckingham himself has wandered away alone to who knows where .
But that's not how you're going to be .
I'll disguise myself in somber robes .
Either the lovers have different social standings ,
Macbeth !
And this is what you told me he said : that he beat you and pretended his house wasn't his and I wasn't his wife .
What kind of god is ceremony , which suffers more than its worshippers do ?
In that case , if I can wear a mask , let me play Thisbe too !
Keep him away from me !
A man with a wife like that might ask , "Hey , wandering wit , where are you off to ? " Nah , better save the questions for when you find her in your neighbor's bed .
To bed , to bed !
Normally I would ask you what your name is first .
But we won't shift the scene to Southampton until Henry reappears .
Look , he's recovering .
Isn't my vest just as clean and fresh as the day I put it on ?
If they're not honest , they shouldn't look like they are !
But let her live .
If we didn't have rational minds to counterbalance our emotions and desires , our bodily urges would take over .
Just obey me a little bit longer .
Sir , don't even try to beat me in a battle of wits .
When you've finished , you'll be a happy man .
What an idiot this guy is ! , You're a rotten piece of work ! , I beg your highness , beat him up and take his wine bottle from him .
Let's move .
The laws of Venice state that if a foreign resident directly or indirectly attempts to kill any citizen , the person he tried to kill will receive one half of the foreigner's goods .
With a hand like this you need to
If you're as poor a subject as he is a king , you definitely are poor .
Or in the power of reason .
They're more like how you would act if you were a woman telling a scary story by the fireside in front of her grandmother .
As I came down ?
Very well , ma'am .
The one who chooses me will get what he deserves" !
I'll tell you everything exactly as it happened .
I did not kill your husband .
The change will be recorded as a precedent , and many bad legal decisions will result .
You're bleeding a lot .
I have to make do .
Well then , good bye , my lord .
What , does the news only get worse ? , Please , Bassanio , I'm half of you , so let me bear half the burden this letter brings you .
I will , my Hermia .
Please wait , sir .
Me too .
She will have a seat , you heard my daughter tell you how .
The letters he spoke of may help me .
I saw it with my own eyes .
Even in hell you couldn't find a devil worse than Macbeth .
Set down your honorable load , men , if there is ever any honor in being dead .
Are you afraid to act the way you desire ?
How many noblemen would be weeded out and would become peasants ?
Young boy , I wish I could make you believe that I'm in love .
She thinks I'll marry her because she loves me .
Actually , it's my arm .
I found that handkerchief by accident and gave it to my husband .
He's afraid to come in .
Unless you're talking about his love for this kind of foolishness , which , judging from his appearance , he has , he is no fool for love , as you pretend .
I have no interest in getting mixed up with the devil .
Actually , it's not so unusual when you think about it .
What are you saying , Cordelia ?
He commanded me to wake him up early .
My Lord Constable , are those stars or suns I saw on the armor in your tent tonight ?
Check and see if he's breathing .
Why aren't the leaves withering now that the sap is all dried up ?
It's a horrible thing to die when you're not prepared for it , my gracious lord .
Thank God I'm not a woman and afflicted with all the giddiness that troubles that entire sex .
Did I work to make him king for this ?
The pound of flesh that I want from him was very expensive .
Welcome , Publius .
Do you want to hear it again ?
What news do you bring ?
I'm locked in one of them .
That's Cassio's voice .
Isn't he the one who's always , " and so on .
All right .
No .
God has blessed you with a good name .
And that's true , he Then I pleaded for you .
Well , I wouldn't want to undo the naughtiness , since the boy turned out so well .
Make sure everyone knows that .
By Jove that thunders !
The deal is closed .
There'll be hell to pay for this .
They call this "the argumentative countercheck." And so on through "the circumstantial lie" and "the direct lie." And how many times did you say his beard wasn't cut well ?
Go to sleep , and listen to us laughing .
I think he's got the money .
I am dying , Cleopatra , dying .
Who , me , my lord ?
When Caesar says "do this , " it is done .
I'll give my life for you , just to prove this guy wrong when he says I don't love you .
Hello , sir .
You sound out of tune .
Stand aside , Captain Gower .
Gentlemen , let go of him .
So we need another prologue to tell everyone he's not a real lion .
How do you feel , Laertes ?
Good Enobarbus !
Everything that belongs to them is yours .
I heard the galloping of horses .
We've been praying for our husbands ' welfare .
Oh , Lord , if they were married , they'd drive themselves crazy within a week .
You said the enemy wouldn't come down but keep to the hills and upper regions .
I've heard a lot more .
I speak to you as a plain soldier .
But I wish I could say that's the last time he'll do it !
Cough them up .
Sir Thomas Erpingham .
Noble words , sir .
Give me your blessing .
What mistress do you have ?
Let's see , how can I
So you're around Lady Luck's waist ?
Portia !
I do .
Is he right ?
The law fully authorizes the penalty , which you have to pay according to the contract .
I swear that Claudio will pay dearly for this .
I order you , speak !
I did , and now I've got it !
Listen !
Here he comes with Captain Jamy , the Scots captain .
Tell me , Fluellen : did you just come from the bridge ?
He is in love with Hero .
I think it was a year ago that I told you how much Margaret , Hero's servant woman , likes me .
I'd say the same thing , but I'm afraid I'd be faced out of my way .
Lorenzo will be happy with what we've done .
Hail !
If he can keep it , he'll be set forever .
Oh God , Iago , what can I do to win my husband back again ?
Why , sir , I spent it on this rope .
Ah , here she comes , angry and sad .
Why are you calling him a jerk ?
I'll listen to Cassius , and we will compare their reasons .
How did her eyes get so bright ?
Don't hurt me .
It's even stranger when an angel is so angry .
It's not a false gallop , anyway .
You just said all your lines at once , cues and all. , Pyramus , enter .
Caius Ligarius , I was never your enemy so much as the sickness that's made you so thin .
Of course I hear it .
Hey !
Tell me , rainbow , do you know if either Venus , the goddess of love , or her son , Cupid , is accompanying Queen Juno ?
Was a man ever beaten as much as me ?
Well , that's what the wife brings to the marriage .
But you promise you can keep a secret ?
Their sweet smells come from those little freckles .
I'll use it for fish bait .
But the devil that tempted you gave you no reason why you should commit treason other than to win the name of traitor .
Stop , sir , for God's sake !
There was no limit to what his lustful eye and savage heart would prey on .
The Duke's in a meeting ?
Go , take it away and let your master make whatever use of it he can .
When the vision passes , you'll see that you're just looking at a stool .
He builds our fires , gets our firewood , and does all kinds of useful things for us. , Hey !
The fire is ready .
When you record these sad events in your letters , please describe me exactly as I am .
Ha !
Don't argue against it .
You call yourself my wife , yet you don't call me "husband" ?
But she is no virgin .
I'm off .
A fair woman !
My master and my lord !
Look how she carries on with him !
Sir , I think I have the right to speak , and speak I certainly will .
Their names are marked .
No , it heals gradually .
It won't go on .
And here I am , going crazy in the middle of the woods because I can't find my Hermia .
For standing up for this unpopular king .
If that man , who's made up of conflicts , becomes musical , then there must be something wrong with the universe .
Where is that damned wretch , Tranio , who defied me in such a disgraceful manner ?
We need a more appropriate place to discuss Cordelia and her father .
The devil in him is strong !
Oh Cassius , I'm tired out by many sorrows .
And then you'll see that despite what you thought , I'll be as powerful as I was before .
Isn't it possible to imagine that the noble ashes of Alexander the Great could end up plugging a hole in a barrel ?
I'm here , here !
I'm your advocate , and I'd rather die than give up on you .
Do you really think so ?
Listen !
Then God be praised , it Petruchio , do whatever you like .
We still have time to get all of this done before daybreak .
Are you beautiful ?
They have a coin in England stamped with the figure of an angel , but that's just engraved on the surface .
All right then , legitimate brother Edgar , I have to have your lands .
No other grave on earth shall hold a pair this famous .
Say , uncle Richard , if my brother comes , where will I stay till my coronation ?
I once wrote a sonnet in his praise which began , "Wonder of nature , " I have heard a sonnet to one's mistress that began like that .
Let's give a fair verdict .
So get prepared .
Sir Walter Herbert , a renowned soldier ; Sir Gilbert Talbot ; Sir William Stanley ; Oxford ; the highly feared Pembroke ; Sir James Blunt ; Rice ap Thomas , with a valiant crew ; and many other famous and powerful noblemen .
Oh , she tears that letter into a thousand small pieces and berates herself for being so forward as to write a letter to a man she knows would mock her .
Let's go , then !
No more , no more .
My dear master , my captain , my sovereign , let me say before I strike this fatal blow : farewell .
No , Cassio wasn't killed .
Goneril , you aren't worth the dust the wind blows in your face .
Why , that's just the way to frustrate their plans and defeat their absurd intentions .
We might as well send orders to the whale to come ashore as try to restore order in soldiers carried away with their looting .
It won't last .
And don't say all of that yet .
He was dressed like a hunter .
Would you mind if we woke up the king ?
I've had enough of this "off with you ! " Come on , let me in !
Continue , then , and don't forget to perform all of the rituals .
Why has your queen , Juno , called me here to this grassy spot ?
I've already told you quite plainly that my daughter will never marry you .
You're taking it more seriously than I meant it .
Come on , let's get to the banquet .
Oh , my good lord , don't make me insult music again with my awful singing .
I'll give you a good reason to cringe , I promise you .
But not so nice when women misbehave .
On me , though I am limping and deformed ?
It's like a cannon .
A better example , come on .
Go to my brother Cassius .
My plans take me a roundabout way .
We'll have a couch made up that's softer and more fragrant even than the bed of lustful
Are you drunk ?
Well , then he must be alive .
How did you two get separated ?
I don't like your faults .
Be good enough to take back the same answer I gave before .
Ha ha , are you good ?
The ambassadors are back from Norway , sir .
Oh , yes , Benedick has returned and is as cheerful as ever .
Here's the head of that notorious traitor , the dangerous and unsuspected Hastings .
Did you call me ?
These young children cry for Clarence and so do I , though they don't cry for Edward , as I do .
I wish there was less social pressure to drink .
A friend .
Most powerful lord , my mistress Cleopatra sent me to you .
Look , your wife is with him .
My lord , the queen wants to speak with you right away .
Do I know these men who are with you ?
What are they doing on the road ?
Is it really possible that you could like her right after meeting her ?
I'm out of breath , sir .
Charles did the same to the second brother , and the third .
The same thing .
What should I say ?
The new challenge scared them about as much as sparrows frighten eagles , or rabbits frighten a lion .
But in spite of all this , the man is still wealthy enough .
Oh , dear gods !
It was just an accident !
Is it possible dat I sould love de enemy of France ?
Will you come with me to hear this news , sir ?
The one who plays the part of the king will be particularly welcome .
The prayers of saints and those that Richard wronged support us like high-walled fortresses .
What do you say ?
Driven ? " Really ?
What a storm !
Oh , damn , damn , damn !
Then surrender , coward , and we'll put you in a freakshow , just like they do with deformed animals .
Oh , how strange !
Yes , that's quite likely .
Where's your father ?
And let the wise man run away .
Will no one back me up ?
I didn't like the way a particular courtier had cut his beard .
I'm left with nothing to do in this weak , idle peacetime , unless I want to look at my lumpy shadow in the sun and sing about
Well , good luck !
I know where I'll wear this dagger , then .
I don't have that kind of reputation !
Yes , indeed , it was , and he pushed it away three times , each time more gently than the last ; and at each refusal my countrymen shouted .
Though this island may appear desolate ,
Stephano !
Call the Duke of Burgundy .
Why are you looking at me so strangely ?
I've been dishonored : I arranged for a friend of mine to marry a common whore .
I lead a charmed life , which can't be ended by anyone born from a woman .
If I die before you do make sure I'm wrapped in those sheets in my coffin .
They want to whip me for telling the truth , you want to whip me for lying , and sometimes I'm even whipped for keeping quiet .
Meet with the ambassadors .
Who's there , in the other devil's name ?
You're hitting close to home there .
I have half a mind to hit you before you speak again .
This box is too threatening .
I curse her .
To whom ?
Alas , she has been too long exiled from France , whose crops all lie in heaps , rotting with ripeness .
What did he do to you ?
It's your job in life to kill the innocent ?
Where's the evidence against me ?
Really , he won it from me once before in a dishonest game of dice .
No , no more than is reasonable .
I told him that your father was in Venice , and that you expected him to arrive in Padua today .
In this wicked world , criminals often take the money they stole and use it to buy off the law , shoving justice aside .
But , uncle , you know how to bear with him .
One of them is too much like a painting of a man , he never speaks , and the other is too much like a spoiled little boy , always chattering .
But , hey , this doesn't mean you're looking to get married , does it ?
How are you , Guildenstern ?
I'm telling you to make a fist and pound .
Gentlemen , I don't know what you intend to do , who else you intend to kill , who else you consider corrupt .
Please lock the door and keep quiet .
Let's call for help and get them tied up again !
Let me wipe it off first .
Your sister's sister .
It will be to your advantage , because I'll leave our father's house and all his property to you , while I live and die a shepherd here in the forest .
If you steal my money , you're just stealing trash .
Now would you please listen once again to the request I made to you earlier ?
Time travels at different speeds for different people .
No , first let's talk to him .
The Queen is coming .
Come , let's continue on toward your father's house .
But , look , poor me , what a terrible tragedy is here !
Don't deceive me .
Sure , since beauty's power can more easily change a good girl into a whore than the power of goodness can change a beautiful girl into a virgin .
Yes , by God !
You have my consent .
Oh , please do .
Yes .
I did that and more , which brings me to the point of this second meeting .
You call this sneering ?
These vows are just traps for stupid birds .
Come on , let's go see King Edward .
Listen to what the tyrant says .
Give me a goblet. , Hamlet , this pearl's yours .
Of all places , I don't like the
And I know that by now they're waiting for me on the porch outside Pompey's theater .
I can't do this .
I beg your pardon , except for the widow Dido .
I know it's foolish to be so much in love , but I can't help it .
Your voice is loud and commanding , but you look like a working man .
I've never seen the waters so disturbed .
She's desperate .
What's wrong , Hecate ?
Well , that doesn't worry me .
I'm at your service until death .
Your misery will make them sharp and piercing like mine .
Please !
What a long night this is !
But yet , madam , I don't like the sound of "but yet." It reverses all the good that came before it .
He has his moods and his ways .
Oh , gods , give me patience !
She was too attached to her filthy marriage ever to do a thing like that !
It's all right , since they left their food behind , and we're hungry .
To the field !
Something's wrong , the man sounds panicked .
He's pretty awful in the morning when he's sobering up , and even worse in the afternoon when he's drunk .
He keeps tearing out his white hair , which the blindly raging winds catch up and blow away into nothingness .
Why ?
I am one , my lord .
I think he really is angry .
Stay and speak !
Murder !
You did , not just once or twice , but twenty times .
Many thanks , Signior Gremio .
Please , sir , hurry up .
God Almighty , there must be some essential goodness even in evil , if men would only look for it .
Then you might as well say they're not dead .
My strange self-delusions just come from inexperience .
Really , cousin , it's him .
He did touch on women a bit , but his body was aching with fever and he talked about the Whore of Babylon .
I wasn't talking to any man at that time , my lord .
Everyone knows that when you pour a drink out of a cup and into a glass , the cup becomes empty .
I'll tell you truly what I think about the king in my heart .
I can swim like a duck , I swear .
I've got to go .
That's how someone who's been murdered should look , and that's how I look .
Gentlemen , I hope you are well .
Oh , mighty Caesar !
My Lord of Warwick , a most corrupt treason , God be praised for it ! , has been discovered , as plain as any you'd hope to see on a summer's day .
Our army has recently acquired many of Mark Antony's former soldiers , enough to capture him .
Tell her we mean her no disrespect .
Call the numbskull back in here .
It's nice to see children playing well together .
How many people are cowards at heart but wear beards like Hercules or Mars , the god of war ?
Terrible .
The general is talking to you !
Under Captain Gower , my liege .
Cobble you , sir .
Listen to him talk about war , and you'll hear elegant and thrilling accounts of the battles .
Naked in bed together , but without doing anything ?
You are welcome , sir .
What did I promise , my dear ?
Do you know his plans ?
This world is almost six thousand years old , and in all this time not one man has ever actually died from love .
And so I said to my daughter : "Lord Hamlet is a prince , he's out of your league .
Have you returned smiling from the great battle for the world ?
Yes , sir , but not when I'm enraged .
Are you really saying these things , or am I dreaming ?
Tell me .
Well .
I came from Corinth , Your Highness .
My lord , I have news for you .
Picture the linen sails driven by the invisible and subtle wind as they pull the vast hulls through the wrinkled sea , breasting the high waves .
I think a few members of the court should fetch the young prince from Wales and bring him to London to be crowned our king .
Burn !
If she and I are happy , what's it to you ?
What villains did this to you ?
If you work for him , you're a fool and should wear a fool's cap. , So how's it going , uncle ?
Now , noble Buckingham , seal this alliance by embracing my wife's friends , and make me happy in your unity .
What a heavy sigh !
It's almost fairy time .
If it's sad to see a handsome man with a cheating wife , it's a tragedy to see an ugly thug with a wife who's faithful .
No , stop .
On this hill and in despair , with his slave Pindarus .
No , it's Casca , someone who's going to work with us .
Do you smell something naughty ?
So take her , shepherd , and God bless you .
You know that I gave it to you a half hour ago .
I'm hanging on every word .
With the quick , intelligent wit she's rumored to have , she can't really be such a bad judge of character that she'd refuse a man as exceptional as Signior Benedick .
Let's drink to our general !
Tell me , please : how many boys and girls will I have ?
Whatever kind you want , I guess .
Good , I'm satisfied .
Oh , finish what I've begun .
But now it's stopped .
Unless your taunts can undo the signature on my contract , you're just wearing out your lungs by speaking so loud .
That's what the Prince and my fiance say .
The only possibility is that you've murdered him .
Revenge .
From head to toe ?
No , my noble lord .
Get out of here , my friend .
Should I perjure my soul by disobeying it ?
Who says he is ?
If Duncan bleeds I'll paint the servants ' faces with his blood .
Don't forget the vows we made to each other .
That's what you get for marrying Christian husbands .
So what do you say to my suit ?
What have you two sisters done ?
Caesar , I will .
I'm sick , Charmian .
Thank you , Tubal .
Thank you .
I learned it in England , where they have a talent for drinking .
Hastings and Edward's children , Rivers and Grey , holy King Henry and your fine son Edward , Vaughan , and all who have died from underhanded , corrupt , fiendish injustice , if your angry souls are witnessing this moment through the clouds , enjoy the revenge , laugh at my ruin !
Is this a dagger I see in front of me , with its handle pointing toward my hand ?
Then leave her , sir .
Only three so far ?
Were you dreaming , Lucius ?
Don't provoke me any further or I'll forget to restrain myself .
He's laughed at my losses , made fun of my earnings , humiliated my race , thwarted my deals , turned my friends against me , riled up my enemies , and why ?
Let's sit here and let the music fill our ears .
Take care of the queen !
Actually , once or twice she sighed and said , "father , " as if the word were pressing on her chest .
I wander everywhere faster than the moon revolves around the Earth .
I thank you , lady .
I've only given the articles a cursory glance .
Since this prize is yours , Be happy with it , and don't look for a new one .
The tawny cat has meowed three times .
Those tears will bring blessings to you .
Of all the strange things I've ever heard , it seems most strange to me that men fear death , given that death , which can't be avoided , will come whenever it wants .
But you're still my child , my flesh and blood , or rather you're a disease in my flesh , a disease I still have to call my own .
Oh , I could weep my soul right out of myself !
Ah , good old Kent said this would happen , that poor , banished man .
The Phoenix is my house ?
You don't wish we had more help from England anymore , cousin ?
He's already done so .
Yes , if that would be all right with your Lordship .
I'll hound him .
But be quiet , here comes Thisbe .
What do you want from me ?
In the meantime I'll tell you all , as honestly as I confess my sins to God , how I wooed this beautiful lady , and how she came to love me .
He's a marvelously witty fellow , no doubt , but I'll outmaneuver him. , Come over here ; I'll whisper a word in your ear .
But if you decide not to marry me , you'll marry this faithful shepherd instead ?
And in a P.S .
Sure , or anything else you show him .
Abandon the person that has abandoned himself .
Don't keep anything back , I insist .
Live a little , be comforted a little , cheer up a little .
Today he fought as though he were a god who hated mankind .
My life has run its circle .
If he's not around , bring his brother Oliver to me .
Our tattered navy has reassembled and set sail , as formidable as the sea itself .
For assuredly , you are so near the abyss that you're bound to be swallowed up .
Eyes , do you see ?
My dagger , little nephew ?
Oh , ceremony , only show me your value !
Women are made for
This is the roof under which Lorenzo said to meet him .
We'll have celebration feasts for each other before we go our separate ways .
Well , then , put your sword away .
Oh , noble fool !
Aren't I your Rosalind ?
I hope you haven't lost your mind .
Give us a smile .
Here's to you , Menas .
Yes , and be brief .
Not a second more .
If grief doesn't kill me , I'll find a quicker way to kill myself , even though I think grief will do the job just as well .
Sister , you know he promised to give me a necklace .
And if he doesn't deserve this joy on earth , he'll never deserve it in heaven .
Officer , I'll take the responsibility from you , and the blame too .
Give our officers notice of our intentions .
All right , but first let the ambassadors speak .
Oh , wouldn't it be great if property , rank , official positions , and other honors were earned only by merit , not by corruption ?
And let us swear to our resolution .
He's in Athens , my lord .
She's obedient , a fine lady .
Iago , I'm leaving my dear Desdemona with you .
Not until you pass out .
Oh , Hamlet , how far she fell !
No , from the moon , I'm telling you .
Well , okay. , I swear to God , both their stories match .
I frown at him , but he still loves me .
That's enough for the senate .
But not a member of the royal family , like me .
Ha , ha , ha !
I won't .
It's a good thing I'm like a little pot and warm up quickly , or else my lips themselves would freeze and stick to my teeth , my tongue to the roof of my mouth , and my heart would freeze in my belly , before I managed to get thawed out .
Are you sure of that ?
We'll win yet .
I could drown the world .
In the entire play , not one word is well-written , and not one of the actors is right for his part .
Cassio was attacked here in the dark by Roderigo and men who escaped .
But she is wise .
In his ignorant jealousy , he'll totally misunderstand Cassio's smiles , gestures , and jokes. , How are you , lieutenant ?
But really , are you the one who's been hanging on the trees those poems that speak so admiringly of Rosalind ?
When she landed at the port , Antony sent an invitation for her to come to supper .
I was born to speak cleverly , not seriously .
Tell me .
Wouldn't he be a comfort to us in our travels ?
Halt !
I ask for him , and he comes .
When you see a huge wheel rolling down a hill , you shouldn't try to hold on to it or it'll break your neck .
Come on .
I'm dying to see the prince .
Then he'll be as calm and quiet as a dove waiting for her eggs to hatch .
Of course he is , and so are you .
Like hell !
His messengers are waiting here to take me to him immediately , on pressing state business .
Oh , now I really need that priest who spoke to me today !
What a poor instrument , that can do such a noble deed !
The next hailstone should hit Caesarion , until one by one all my children , and every one of my brave Egyptians , are killed by the dissolving of this pellet storm and lie unburied , covered by gnats and flies .
My good lord , You've always been a liar .
He leaps from the ground as if his insides were light as hairs .
Damn my suspicious thoughts !
Within the next three days I want to hear you tell me that Cassio's dead .
Oh , a thousand of them , all of which I've forgotten .
Come .
My lord , what's wrong with you ?
The king , whom I hope God will protect better than you would like , can't get a minute's rest without you bothering him with your outrageous complaints .
Why are you asking me that ?
I am their aunt , and I love them like a mother .
Who's there ?
You horrid slave , you can't be trained to be good , and you're capable of anything evil !
But what if my answer's no ?
I'll sleep here until morning .
Go ahead , but I won't listen .
Hide her for a while in your house , and tell everyone that she has , in fact , died .
My brother didn't use my name to justify his rebellion .
Damn you , don't mock and sneer at me .
Whip me , you devils , so I don't have to look at this heavenly sight !
Fool , do not flatter yourself .
Sheep pens are empty in the middle of the flooded fields , and the crows get fat from eating the dead bodies of infected sheep .
We have to give up and let him go .
My lord of Orleans , and my lord high Constable , are you talking about horses and armor ?
Oh God , do I have to remember that ?
What a stupid man he's become !
You must all keep up this united front .
Where is this man ?
The sweet and bitter fool Will appear right away .
No one has ever faked passion as skillfully as this , then .
Go ahead if you want , but remember that crying doesn't suit a man .
I don't know .
Oh , are you really !
Servants , take these gentlemen to see Hamlet .
Take Beatrice , have you come because I called for you ?
But if you didn't know about it , then you were wrong to get mad at us .
With all my heart , I give you that thing which , if you didn't already have it , I'd try with all my heart to keep from you .
What power can rein in promiscuous evil once it's gotten rolling ?
That's why paintings of Cupid , the god of love , always show him as blind .
Ill will never prompted anything well said .
The worst thing imaginable has happened .
Who would do that ?
I've got some business to take care of .
Has he taken care of the music ?
I have often led you , now you must carry me , my good friends , and take my thanks for everything .
Yes , I am .
Fire !
I weep for Caesar in that he was good to me .
Sir , I think I saw him last night .
Oh , so you'd give me all your tediousness ?
They stared at us in confusion .
How goes the battle ?
You will never fall victim to Benedick's charms , my niece .
I tell you , you would find the rituals of war and , I promise you , its ceremonies and its solicitudes and its forms and its gravity and its discipline all to be quite counter to all this noise .
Who wants to buy the flock and the pasture ?
Well , what's going on , mister ?
Picture the mayor and all his brother citizens dressed in their best as they go forth like senators of ancient Rome to welcome home their conquering Caesar .
What's that noise ?
Come , tailor , show it to us .
Then it looks like Macbeth will become king .
The treacherous weapon is right in your hand , sharp and dipped in poison .
And if you rattle on about mountains , then let them throw millions of acres over us .
I will .
Just to the Tower , I'm guessing , for the same reason you are : to salute the noble princes who are staying there .
Give me your hand .
A ship you sent me to find , to book passage out of here .
If you thought that you'd be thinking too much .
Play me some music .
Hey monster , the spirit you've been talking about , the one you call harmless , has been playing tricks on us .
Then immediately call the rest of the watch together and thank God that you've gotten rid of such a criminal .
Indeed , before he fell down , when he realized the commoners were glad he refused the crown , he pulled open his robe and offered them his throat to cut .
Not in my house , Lucentio .
My hands are tainted if they hit an inferior , especially since I myself am the cause of my own distress .
Kate is as straight and slender as a hazel-twig , her hair as brown as hazelnut shells , and she herself sweeter than the kernels .
You call this a scale ?
You're not leaving the house today .
The servants of the Duke and my lieutenant ?
Only for poor men ?
What else can I say ?
It was just moments ago .
Now get out of here !
Yes , I truly think He did great good .
Stay here at your own risk .
Here on her breast there's a little bloody mark .
After a brief time , as he is a strong , brave man ,
Don't tire yourself out , monsieur .
Good .
If he loves Caesar , then he can only hurt himself , by grieving and dying for Caesar .
Throw some of your words at me .
You had a Clarence , too , and Richard killed him .
My library was a large enough dukedom for me .
And you deadly cannons that roar like thunderbolts thrown by the gods , goodbye !
He looks angry .
I am not some fiend of hell : you can't get rid of me with spells .
But just be patient until we've calmed the masses , who are beside themselves with fear .
That means it's high time for me to go .
If he were dead , you'd be weeping for him .
Nothing .
But Caesar ignores offers that don't give him an advantage , and so should you .
Just being thanked is more than enough for me , madam .
No , it wasn't .
This is no place for you ; this home is now a slaughterhouse .
Come now , keep your oath .
I rely on your virtue to protect me .
Madam , how are you liking this play ?
Oh , Lord , this makes me laugh !
A very clear way , but there is no friend who will undertake it .
Oh , there's the problem .
Claudio , I'm telling you right to your face that you have wronged me and my innocent child .
Can you help me ?
I'll be good , sir .
What we are is up to us .
It's the former Hero !
I will , my lord .
Murder's always horrible , but this one was especially horrible , weird , and unnatural .
Tomorrow I'll be at the depths of my misery thinking about the happiness my brother has achieved , in having what he wished for .
There are many troubles brewing now that have yet to become full-fledged threats .
Lily-livered coward , what's he doing there ?
Yes , Celia , we kept her here for your sake .
Well that's good .
The other voice is harsh and abusive .
Come over here , gentlemen , and put your hands on my sword again .
You wanted to be king of the island , sir ?
And return to us immediately , bringing Messala with you .
I don't think you've got much of a reason to love me .
And I had to be away !
The law's on my side .
If you can leave your body so easily , then the touch of death is like a lover's pinch , which hurts but is desired .
Seriously , though , son Petruchio , I think you have the most thoroughgoing shrew of us all .
Answer when I call your name. , Nick Bottom , the weaver ?
Where's the king ?
Here come the lovers , laughing happily. , I wish you joy , my friends !
Who's that coming over here ?
God save the king !
The Venetians are waiting for their food .
Is the king dead , the empire dispossessed ?
Plain and simple loyalty doesn't make anyone act phony .
Time ambles for both men .
No one shows mercy because he has to .
I will see them .
Go quickly , hurry , to the castle , for I've given orders to have Lear and Cordelia killed .
I am the son of Marcus Cato !
Dying , sleeping , that's all dying is , a sleep that ends all the heartache and shocks that life on earth gives us , that's an achievement to wish for .
You are right , it's for my mistress .
But oh , how odd it is to have to ask for my child's forgiveness !
I had you figured for a piece of furniture .
Love each other and be friends , like two such men should be .
I should think that your appetite would act like a clock ( as mine does ) and bring you home on its own , without the need for a messenger .
You're sure full of smooth answers .
In this house lives a man who despises all that is good in you .
My Queen and Eros have by their brave examples beaten me to the history books .
Nothing .
You liar , you respond better to the whip than to kindness !
Instead , lend it to me as your enemy .
He never did harm that I heard of .
Indeed , I would have such an exploit for you , Ligarius , if you were healthy enough to hear it .
Of course , they won't believe you without proof .
You'll be my wife , dearest , and I'll serve you forever .
I'd rather be a toad in a moldy basement than to have only a part of someone I love , sharing the rest of her with others .
Quiet , quiet !
Listen , will you walk with me around the town and then dine with me at the inn ?
I must be one of these silent so-called wise men Gratiano's talking about , because he never lets me get a word in .
Like a good doctor .
Why , she's a lamb , a dove , a child compared to him !
I'm telling you , I hardly know myself .
God forbid !
The Egyptian flagship , the Gods and goddesses , the whole congregation of them !
Maybe I'll never go home again , Iago !
Yes , sir .
Like gambling , sir ?
And when some lowlife protests that Stop , and eat no more .
Out in the world , I'm like a drop of water , trying to find a drop that matches in the whole wide ocean .
Tell my servants not to mention that we were gone .
Tell him to gather together the greatest army he can muster in a hurry and meet me right away at Salisbury .
If that's what you want , all right .
Help me , help me !
Cut my corset laces , Charmian , so I can breathe .
Oh , you villain !
Some to Ligarius's .
Here , madam .
Tyrrel , I mean those bastards in the Tower .
Keep beating , my heart , and muscles , don't grow old yet , keep me standing .
Time has come round , and I'll end where I began .
Then it's no surprise they had a bad influence on him .
So please , most gracious duke , order her to bring him out so we can get him some help .
Amen .
Let thunder flatten the spherical world , crack open all the molds from which nature forms human beings , and spill all the seeds from which ungrateful humans grow !
Awaken the memory of those valiant ancestors and with your own powerful arm make their deeds live again .
If I had the goddess Juno's power , I would make the strong-winged messenger , Mercury , pick you up and seat you beside Jove .
She is not sick , my lord , but she is troubled with endless visions that keep her from sleeping .
I am ready for you .
I want to be friends with you , and forget all the times you've embarrassed and humiliated me .
I'm telling you all this out of affection for you , so you can either keep him from carrying out his plans or prepare to accept his disgrace , which will be his own fault , not mine .
May my wrinkles forbid that !
He's not getting anything except the penalty .
Your answer ?
There'd be no kingship , He wants to be king in a place with no kingship .
Where ?
You've stained your virtue with your own actions .
Well , how nice , a riddle !
So , may the gods protect you and change the hearts of the Romans so that they turn and give you their support .
Since your woes are only a portion of mine , I have every reason to surpass your lamentations and drown out your cries with my own .
I say she shall. , And first begin with her .
No , indeed , my lord .
Where's Dolabella ?
Hail to your majesty .
All I'll tell you is that the duke has had dinner already .
If you like , you can rest a while in my room .
I'll hire you again to go back to Rome .
Error in the bill , sir , error in the bill !
I know what you'd do .
Kate , my wooing is fit for your understanding : I am glad your English isn't better .
What , you dare put your hands on me , villain ?
How many infatuated people go mad with jealousy !
Lend me your handkerchief .
Then please tell me he's all right .
Can't you somehow use your dissatisfaction to your own advantage ?
If my lips had the power to give life , I would wear them out like this .
What if she's pretty but stupid ?
No , it was just a dream .
I know you're my oldest brother , and deserve more respect .
Isn't my fortune just a little better than hers ?
Don't make me do it , my lady .
I have to follow him and give him the letter .
People who die of it seldom or never recover .
Or is he on his horse ?
Come , take away the Here comes Master Signior Leonato with the sexton .
Don't damn yourself .
Anyone who wants to separate us will have to smoke us out of the cave of our togetherness like foxes .
That's a good one .
Pluck off colorful butterfly wings , and use them to fan moonbeams away from his eyes as he sleeps .
The rest of the king's guests are already inside .
You flea , you louse , you winter cricket !
The law allows it , and the court awards it .
Sadness and despair !
By Jesus , he will defend his position on the practices of the ancient Roman wars as well as any military man in the world .
I'm sure you both remember me .
Now that I'm done , Wall can go away .
But can I have some hope ?
I'll do that .
These corpses suggest mayhem .
Is there more work to do ?
If you don't , if I'm left alone , I swear I'll have that legal expert as my bedfellow .
Iago , give these letters to the ship's captain who brought me here , and ask him to pay my respects to the Senate of Venice .
He was also shocked to learn that on the same day you fought the rebels you also fought against the army of Norway , and that you weren't the least bit afraid of death , even as you killed everyone around you .
The alcohol that got the servants drunk has made me bold .
What's going on here ?
I have done your bidding and fulfilled my promise .
What's with you , my lord ?
So , she's in on this too !
Nothing , my lord .
But I'll tell you something from my soul .
We have lost a major portion of the world through utter foolishness .
It sets you up for a fall .
Are you so pious that you would pray for this man and his children , a man who has pushed you toward an early grave and put your family in poverty forever ?
Are these spirits we see before us ?
I don't have a lord .
I'm Christopher Sly .
Has my master returned yet ?
Among them are one hundred twenty-six princes and standard-bearing nobles .
This wicked son of mine confirms the prediction , son against father .
Try again .
But are they all safe , Ariel ?
That's the way a good deed shines in a naughty world .
Who's sleeping in the second chamber ?
I don't know , ma'am .
It's partly my own fault , since I followed you here .
Thank you , sir .
Why are you whipping that whore ?
I'll drain the life out of him .
Oh God !
Be patient , I'm telling you .
Not even one success ?
I'll try talking to him again .
Stop hollering , man !
What a miracle !
You had rotten food , and he helped you eat it .
If he isn't what he might be , then I wish to God he were !
Oh , well , stay till then !
She didn't ask anything ?
Please , come with me .
Tennis balls , my liege .
Was that the prologue or the inscription on some wedding ring ?
I'll copy the embroidery pattern and then give it to Iago .
I'm not insulting you .
Tortured ,
Now all the late travellers are hurrying to reach their inns .
I have news , old news such as you never heard before !
Nature , I don't accuse your weather of unkindness .
Tell him , if he comes here , I'll explain everything to him and , on my word , he'll leave unharmed .
I thought I heard a voice cry , "Sleep no more !
I'll go too and make sure that happens .
And , just in time , here comes the sweaty lord .
Hurry .
Lead me to where you're standing .
Age hasn't dried up my body or eroded my intelligence so much , and luck hasn't robbed me of so much of my fortune , and my bad ways haven't deprived me of so many friends , that they won't find me ready to seek revenge both physically and mentally , with money and friends at my disposal .
This is a classic example of the idiocy of the world : when we're down and out , often because of our own excesses , we put all the blame on the sun , the moon , and the stars , as if they forced us to be bad , or the heavens compelled us to be villainous or stupid .
Help !
I'll hide and listen in .
No , I swear on my honor , I haven't , madam .
No , this fun is not for me .
I admit it doesn't look that way to me , and the fact that you suspect me shows that you're smart .
Conscience , " I say , "you give good advice." "Devil , " I say , "you give good advice." If I listened to my conscience , I'd stay with the Jew my master , who's a devil .
She dropped it carelessly , and , seizing the opportunity , since I was here , I picked it up .
Didn't you hear their shouts ?
Look !
But prepare yourself for some unpleasantness .
It was the day he overcame the Nervii warriors .
Good , good , I like that , it's only fair !
He loves Caesar best , but he also loves Antony .
Don't imagine that I'll ever allow myself to return to Rome in chains .
Yes , sir , it's all too true , God help us .
The king acts unnaturally , father against child .
No one's life should have been entrusted to them .
Please , my lord , don't be friendly with her .
So you're telling me to give it time and wait for summer .
Why , his cuckold's horns , of course , the kind you men are always blaming on your wives .
But come , lords , will you come with me to Edward's room to comfort him ?
Please keep in mind we're only here out of spite .
Whether I go ahead with them or not is completely up to you .
It was two o'clock when I left him , and now it's one .
When we're born , we cry because we've arrived on the stage of life , like all the other fools .
I'd obey even if she were my mother ten times over .
Isn't that what they said ?
You said she slept with Cassio .
Give me my robe .
Let him become Caesar !
Here , sir , as foolish as ever .
What business is it of yours ? , Father , be quiet .
A grandmother is loved hardly less than a mother is .
But fathers who are rich Make their children kind .
That's how it was with Henry the Sixth , who was crowned in Paris when he was only nine months old .
I'll take no lesser name than that of Something that refers to my current state .
Tell the Duke of Albany to prepare for war immediately .
As for my wife , if only you had such a wife .
Good idea .
I am no tyrant but a Christian king , whose emotions are as tightly controlled as the wretches who languish in our prisons .
To hell with your sword .
One , so they can save the money they spent on hairstyling , and two , so that when their hair falls out it doesn't land in their dinner .
My forces are growing , and everything I know tells me it's all coming together .
It would be much appreciated .
I wouldn't think much of it even if it were heavier .
What does my powerful master wish for ?
That young man who was just here .
Agreed .
I , who have heard the rumble of guns in battle , and thunder in the sky ( heaven's version of artillery ) .
I'd better not drink now .
What is it , my lord ?
Stay here .
Of course the Prince wants Hero for himself .
I fear that your words and your heart are both false .
Your children caused you trouble in your youth , but mine will bring you comfort in your old age .
Whatever your highness commands me to do , it is always my duty to do it .
Give me some wine and let me say a few words .
And my sweet master , I received no gold .
Ha !
If it's possible to do this without putting yourself in danger , dear Captain Blunt , say goodnight to him from me and give him this important note .
But how ?
So what's going on ?
I'll look into it further .
I've fought my way through obstacles twenty times more terrifying than you with this weapon .
What happened , sir ?
The king and queen are coming down with everyone else .
Kill him rather than let him leave this room .
You come to me saying , "Shylock , we need money." You say that ! , even though you spat on my beard and kicked me like you'd kick a stray mutt out your front door .
I've always been straightforward with you , so now I'm telling you what I think .
I'm not sure it's true , but just the suspicion is enough for me .
We're ruined !
I wish you all the comfort that such a dark night as this can offer , noble father-in-law .
I'm speaking for the king , but I look like myself .
Don't be late .
Let it be .
It's been my bad luck to remain alive long enough to be able to tell the sad stories of my own misfortunes .
There's a ransom .
Set the honorable old man down and let him eat .
Well , it doesn't matter .
Me , marry her ?
Didn't you tell me that I'd be able to recognize the man by the Athenian clothes he was wearing ?
I could marry you there , gentle Hermia , where the strict laws of Athens can't touch us .
Here are the keys , and there is the duke , sleeping .
Gentle boy , good night .
You certainly made me believe you did , my lord .
If you still love her after that , then marry her tomorrow .
Will he bring his army ?
But what's the joke ?
What can I do for you ?
What do you say now ?
Why have you come here in such a mob ?
Murder !
Back so soon ?
Oh Setebos , these are handsome spirits !
Don't say what you're thinking , and don't be too quick to act on what you think .
Also , he's left you all his walkways , in his private gardens and newly planted orchards , on this side of the Tiber River .
Everything is gloomy , dark , and dreadful .
Don't worry about that .
Damn it !
Battered armor , be off .
My grandmother told me he was murdered there .
You've never thought of me like that , and you have no reason to .
Their villainy nauseates me , and I must therefore vomit it up .
Well , let it strike ten then .
We are used to winning by standing on the earth and fighting toe to toe .
Bad people can't appreciate wisdom or goodness .
Who does it gallop for ?
Here is the money .
almost read people's thoughts .
The king my father ? !
That's why it's better for wise men to trumpet their own virtues , like I do .
Actually , I'd like a few pounds of grass .
I use it all the time , since it's all that I have .
What are you thinking about so seriously ?
Offer yourself more respect , or , not to beat this word to death , you'll offer me the chance to be a laughing-stock .
You can't mean it , Tranio !
I have no power over you .
Sirs , never mind .
I wish I could be as certain of a good dinner .
My husband !
I felt like skipping school , sir .
person when you're ready , if you're inclined .
What's that , you runt ?
But often in these cases , reports are just estimates .
Do you acknowledge the contract ?
May the gods be with you .
Now , if courtiers were shepherds , that kind of courtesy would be unclean .
Because of me ?
I'm very glad I came to see you .
Oh , eastern star !
Where are you taking me ?
When you find out who started this disagreement , turn your anger upon them .
Oh , you bloody prison , fatal and threatening to noble lords !
So prepare to die .
I didn't call you .
Please , don't make fun of me .
Fruits and vegetables don't ripen until the right season of the year .
What a day this is !
You killed this king , didn't you ?
I shall faint .
What role did you play ?
No more of this .
murder !
Is that Barnardo ?
Please stay seated .
Come , father , I'll leave you at a friend's house .
I hope to God Othello's all right .
Let's pray that we never come into conflict like that again .
But brother , I have some strange news for you .
Madam , you have to go to your uncle's .
I need proof !
I don't think there's a man under the sun who's worse at hiding his love or hate than Richard .
But first , I have to tell you that Desdemona's completely in love with him .
Are you crazy ?
Well , you know he sometimes walks here in the lobby for four hours at a time .
Yes , sir , they're ready .
If my eyes don't deceive me , you are my Rosalind .
I beg your pardon .
The tragic actors from the city , the ones you used to enjoy so much .
Please , if you can do it without taking advantage of the young man , buy the cottage , pasture , and flock for us , and we'll pay you for it .
Now what ?
Know that I am Brutus !
Be patient , your highness .
Please calm down , uncle .
Thank you , sir .
While we're walking , you can tell me how I ended up sleeping on the ground with these humans last night .
What would you like me to do at Salisbury ?
They'll be here tomorrow or the next day .
They're on the march .
Come on .
Well then , Margaret , Ursula , and my cousin have been very much deceived , for they swore you did .
Six or seven thousand , at most .
Don't stick your head out into the public street to stare at the Christian fools with painted faces .
Brutus speaks .
What can I do for your highness ?
Oh !
Listen they're howling .
But since you come from him , you're saturated with his healing spirit .
By the way , I don't want anyone thinking I'm drunk .
I think it's later than that , sir .
Signor Antonio ?
I'm not sorry , either .
I swear , I don't like the look of you .
Oh Stephano , do you have any more of that wine ?
Shame on you , you slanderer !
Well , first of all , my horse is tired and my master and mistress have had a falling out .
But we already swore , sir .
Welcome to Cyprus .
Yes , every man forward .
I'll be damned if the duke wouldn't have given him six pence a day for playing Pyramus .
Sailors , sir .
Don't bother with it .
Remind Richard of this , and he will weep .
Three or four women near me cried , "Alas , good soul ! " and forgave him with all their hearts .
I'll fish for you and get you plenty of firewood .
I can not drink too much of Brutus's love .
That's true , my lord .
If not , then I have no powers of observation .
Statilius waved the torchlight at us , but he hasn't come back .
Don't I tell you in the clearest terms that I do not and can not love you ?
Lucius , wake up !
There comes an old man with his three sons , It sounds like the beginning of an old folktale .
Look , Don Pedro has come back for you .
Look at him .
My wickedness ?
What are you doing , Caesar ?
This is the day I'm going to get what I wished for when I wished that the person I most trusted would betray me .
Sister , be happy in my unhappiness. , Sir , I will humbly obey you .
Bellario sends his greetings .
I wish your loyalty were as foolish .
What are you saying ?
Thank you for his present and your trouble .
Oh , I suffered along with all the men I watched suffer !
Look how the judge yells at a simple thief .
In that case , leave our cousin Katherine here with us .
We You won't pay for the glasses you smashed ?
I'll pick berries for you .
I'll find you another horse .
Proculeius , Caesar has heard about what you've done here and has sent for you .
Yet Brutus says he was ambitious , and Brutus is an honorable man .
We'll maintain that she died the instant she was accused , and everyone who hears this will grieve for her , pity her , and excuse her actions .
God help me , I love you !
We must remember the gravity of this sad day .
She's dead , I think. , Help , uncle ! , Hero , why Hero !
Brutus , may I have a word with you ?
And I saw her do it .
If she glares , I'll say her brow is as clear as roses newly washed with morning dew .
I hear my father coming .
Oh , why is this so ?
But this is a sure thing : the snake's an odd snake .
Do you remember her face ?
Was he sad or happy ?
Get going now .
Then teach your cousin to also be willing to close her eyes , my lord .
You scolded him in private ?
Oh , don't injure your cousin like that !
Won't he join us ?
What did he say ?
Here's to you !
Here comes another group looking for you .
Don't be offended .
Well , it must have been Signior Benedick .
Master , master !
It's probably some noble gentleman stopping off in mid-journey , thinking to spend the night here .
By this sword , I'll kill whichever one of you makes the first thrust .
Oh , he's crazy , Laertes !
Was it you that was always plotting to kill him ?
Even if I have to die , as they threaten , I have to help the king .
Here is some money for you to kill me immediately .
Who are the new commissioners ?
Lay out the gown .
But it's dark out , and it could be a trap .
Goodbye , Launcelot .
Tonight I received a letter from my sister telling me all about them , and warning me not be at home in case they come to stay at my house .
My Lord of Cambridge and my good Lord of Masham and you , my noble knight , what do you think ?
Oh , come quickly !
They sing when they die .
Go , hurry .
Where's my fool ? , Go call my fool and have him come here .
We'll see you tomorrow .
I won't have anything to do with it .
I wish they were , so that I could die right now , because , at this point , I live a living death .
He's arrived .
What's the problem ?
Is it possible Fulvia is dead ?
He did this in public ?
I don't like her name .
Though we have lost a generous king , we are about to enjoy the benefits of a new king .
Come on , you can go .
If you want to go to hell , there are better ways to do it than killing yourself .
Please be quiet .
I will do this deed before I lose my sense of purpose .
I'll tell them that we won't hurt anyone with our swords , and that Pyramus isn't really dead .
What's the play called ?
Places , everyone !
Are you coming again for ransom ?
Come , bring me to them .
I don't like it that you knew about this , Iago .
I didn't think I would ever fight Pompey .
What do you have to say for yourself ?
It's Captain Macmorris , right ?
Are you any kind of philosopher yourself , shepherd ?
Since you know all this is true , why do you blame me for loving you ?
Give me access to them , and soon you won't have to worry about them anymore .
Really , are you afraid of that ?
Are all the cups and glasses in their places , the tablecloths laid out , everything in order ?
His father , if I do say so myself , is an honest but very poor man , and , thank God , likely to live a long time .
Go ahead and say you don't love me , but not so bitterly .
Well , no , not literally .
Where's my fool ?
What's the matter ?
He's nearby , and Pindarus has come to salute you on behalf of his master .
The devil himself couldn't say a name I hate more .
Whisper to her that Ursula and I are walking in the orchard and that we're talking all about her .
Do you get what I'm saying , Reynaldo ?
Follow it , follow it !
Don't tell me that .
And a true lover of the holy Church .
Then how will we see their own natural tears ?
I'll fall at his feet and lie there until my pleading and crying convinces the duke to come here and force my husband to leave this abbey .
Yes , madam .
Oh , they say that dress surpasses all others .
Who said that I was disdainful , and that I got all my best lines out of a bad joke book ? !
Do you have the lion's part written down ?
Oh , you idiot !
How What , are you jealous , Oberon ? , Fairies , let's get out of here .
The more I try to hide what I'm feeling , the bigger it gets .
Yes , why not , my lord ?
I wish I were senseless , sir , so that I wouldn't feel your punches !
I hear it now overhead .
This chatter is no cure for my toothache .
Why did you leave the dining room ?
Let go of my hand .
The saddle maker has it , sir , I didn't keep it .
And there's no need for wonder or worry .
Let's draw our own swords too .
It's a letter from my brother that I haven't finished reading yet .
What's this ?
What is this spirit that looks like the son of a king and wears a crown on his young head ?
If she restrained your rowdy knights , she had such a good reason that you can't blame her for it .
Monster , I smell like horse piss , which is making my nose pretty upset .
No lady could be more miserable than I if you two disagree .
Listen , Fairy King .
Good thinking .
Please lie down and rest a while , my lord .
They have me tied to a stake .
I'm happy to say "amen" to that !
Musicians , come in !
In this recent storm .
First let's go to dinner .
It's almost five o'clock .
I can't say "whore." It makes me sick to say the word even now .
Yes , with the sign underneath him that says : "Here lives Benedick the married man" ?
We want to hear the will .
You have to be patient with me .
It's noble Kent , your friend .
He'll do whatever Hastings does .
He's a good man. , Let's go , Desdemona .
Good night , madam .
You and he are both welcome , sir .
When Jacob took care of his uncle Laban's sheep , Jacob was the heir to his grandfather Abraham's birthright , because his mother cleverly arranged for her husband Isaac to make Jacob his heir , What's your point ?
You've offered an excellent interpretation .
Did you see him ?
I'm dying an innocent woman .
Is this the king we offered to ransom ?
From this , I conclude that many different elements can work toward one common end , just as many arrows , shot from different points , converge on a single target ; just as many roads meet in a single town ; just as many fresh streams empty into only one salt sea ; just as the many radiuses of a
I will , madam .
What's going on here ?
Oh , heaven help me !
And who are you , good sir ?
Look , here comes someone who loves me , along with someone who loves her .
The foul plan backfired on me .
Why , our troops amount to three times that .
Oh !
You feel love because you feel lust and you have no willpower .
For a necklace your husband had him make .
Who's there ?
As Edgar , I'm nothing at all .
But she's modest and ladylike too .
Now grit your teeth and let your nostrils flare .
You're a king's advisor .
When storms arrive early , you can expect the harvest will be damaged .
Follow me , then .
What !
If you enjoy looking at your awful deeds , take a look at this noteworthy example of your butcheries .
Those who smile at it will soon be dead themselves .
This was the noblest Roman of them all .
Please go back to Goneril's house .
Why does he talk like that to a girl he can't stand ?
My lord ?
No , you have to forget all that now .
Pick up her bed and carry her ladies out of the tomb .
What ?
Spring , summer , fertile autumn and angry winter have all changed places , and now the confused world doesn't know which is which .
And so , beautiful lady , I'm standing here just like that , wondering whether all this can be true until you tell me it is .
We'll mutiny .
My voice is ragged .
So do all thoughts .
Can't what , my lord ?
Not the one I gave you , I hope .
Which of these bad things happened to him ?
If you take it too seriously , it'll have bad effects that I didn't want it to have .
A friend .
Strato , you've slept this whole time .
The lady's overdoing it , I think .
If a Jew offends a Christian , what's the Christian's kind and gentle reaction ?
Here is his Majesty .
She will not come .
If I'm not dreaming , you are Emilia .
I have news , ma'am .
Sorry , sir , Goodman Verges tends to ramble .
So farewell , all , for my tongue has almost finished with its life .
I had planned to celebrate it quietly , but since my lord is once more himself , I will be Cleopatra again .
We'll eat at her place .
Please find a way to give me some time alone with Desdemona , if you think that's all right .
Iras , I won't see you again for a long time .
You've heard something you shouldn't have .
Doesn't Benedick deserve as much luck with a mate as he would have with Beatrice ?
Don't misunderstand me , sir .
A little water will wash away the evidence of our guilt .
For eighty-one weeks he will waste away in agony .
So go ahead and cry .
Oh Scotland , Scotland !
May God and his angels guard your sacred throne and grant that you dignify it for a long time .
Tie up the servant , for he is mad as well .
And now I'm going to leave your despised company .
And her sister's dead too , poisoned by your wife .
Me too , but still , for the sake of good manners , I'll say thanks for your company .
Come down .
Don't insult my master's generosity by killing yourself .
When good orators finish talking , they spit ; when lovers do ( God help us if they ever do ) , they kiss .
You thought you were being funny , but you said the truth .
When we were alone , we agreed that in public she would go on being unpleasant .
We come here to help you and you treat us like thugs , but you let an African horse climb all over your daughter .
No , you don't need to worry about us , Lorenzo .
You don't have to worry about any of these lords , my lady .
Yes , I swear .
What's going on , Borachio ?
You don't look well , Antonio .
Your servant Kent .
If it turns out that she really is running around on me , I'll send her away , even though it'll break my heart .
Yes , what about him ?
Some villains in my court must have known about this and let it happen .
Oh , I'm such a coward for living long enough to see my best friend taken before my eyes !
You won't enjoy it much , I can tell you , the odds are so against this young man .
And yet I still regret the anger that drove me to kill them .
My God , I'm the highest-ranking person who speaks this language , if only we were back where it's spoken .
Have you seen a farmer's dog bark at a beggar ?
That's the curse of military service .
We will watch the execution .
My father can't think straight , a hundred knights !
Your words have moved me , and maybe it'll do some good .
The heavens only announce the deaths of princes .
Have you both really given me up ?
Hurry .
You will be the king .
I can't say no .
Our closest relatives are the ones most likely to murder us .
You speak more wisely than you know .
But in return , please , do one thing for me : leave me alone for a little while .
What's going on between you two ?
Oh , you're so lucky !
That's the one : Leonato's Hero , your Hero , every man's Hero .
Civil wounds now can heal , and peace can live again .
Call me the worst liar ?
Let your anger fall on me then , even if its sharpness pierces my heart .
But give them all a good dinner and look after them well .
Isn't this war against me ?
Do so , good Messala .
Anyway , I have to say goodbye to you now .
Well , well .
Men can be masters of their fate .
I'll write to my stepson Richmond on your behalf , so that he'll meet you on the way .
Come on , woo me , woo me .
Do you think fiery fever can be put out by the windy puff of titles ?
Your peace of mind depends on him .
Arm myself ?
Well , I won't .
Then I'll see you again ?
I plan to fall into the blackest despair .
Signior Baptista , I'm actually in a bit of a hurry .
What foreign lands has he conquered and captive foreigners chained to his chariot wheels ?
I'll do any decent thing , my lord , to help my cousin get a good husband .
There it is .
I'm sure his majesty will recover his health soon .
You call it my " Don't you know ?
We want to hear Caesar's will .
My Lord High Constable , the English lie within fifteen hundred paces of your tents .
And he's not going to do any tomorrow .
Then Antony offered it the third time .
Our imminent separation so occupies our thoughts that even though you stay here , you come with me , and even though I leave here , I stay with you .
Yes , probably , because I'm staying for lunch .
This is the place .
Caesar might act like that .
It's not manly .
We'll put a picture of you on a sign , right above the words "Come see the tyrant ! " I'm not going to surrender and have to kiss the ground in front of Malcolm , or be taunted by the common people .
I'll have to tell the story again every month , since you seem to forget it .
Oh , if only I were a man !
I curse him , but he loves me .
Horatio says we're imagining it , and won't let himself believe anything about this horrible thing that we've seen twice now .
You're afraid of the boar but you go around without your spear ?
Take it and do that for me , and leave me alone for a while .
Indeed , his mocking spirit has now crawled into a Truly , it all adds up to a serious story for Benedick .
It's after six o'clock , my lord , when you said our work would be finished .
So think carefully about what you want , beautiful Hermia .
And that's why he went crazy .
But I don't have any good sides .
This morning , they've flown away and in their place are ravens , crows , and kites , flying over our heads and looking down on us , as though we were sickly prey .
Ah well , my Kate .
And when I told you he was involved the whole time I was trying to get Desdemona , you were like , "Oh , really ? " And then you frowned and wrinkled up your forehead as if you were imagining something horrible .
You are Antonio , you are he .
Believe me , my friend , since I have the power to stop the prosecutors .
Why are we talking about this ?
Say something .
That's treason !
Quiet , children , quiet .
I don't know .
I think you are .
Well , that's what you get to do .
Stop Harry of England , who is now sweeping through our land with banners drenched in the French blood he spilled at Harfleur .
Remember to see me today .
I have no choice .
The rooster has already crowed twice .
Why , she challenges me like a Muslim would challenge a Christian .
Oh , what a horrible day !
Help !
I would give all my glory for a mug of ale and safety .
Hello , Roderigo !
I hope so too , Madam .
I have no more royal sons for you to murder .
There's still the King of France's farewell ceremony .
I'll drink later .
No , let them go .
If it looks like my good father , I'll speak to it , even if Hell itself opens up and tells me to be quiet .
Pretending ?
Back then , I called you "a poor , imitation queen , " a badly reproduced copy of what I was , a pretty prologue for the tragedy that was about to follow , a woman who was lifted high only to be hurled down to hell , a mother only teased with two beautiful children , who would soon die .
Rest easy in the meantime .
No , I swear by my life and soul !
Be kind to her .
Pompey has a strong navy .
Do you think so ?
She was worried about my absence , and about the fact that young Octavius and Mark Antony have grown so strong , which I found out at the same time as the news of her death .
Still , did you notice how ready he was to hire good tutors for her ?
In the same hour , and in the same inn , a poor woman also delivered identical twin boys .
And the greatest sorrow is mine too .
What infinite peace do king's give up that private men enjoy ?
You should have reprimanded him for that .
May the gods bless Antony today !
Come , sweet Audrey .
Here I am , your slave , a poor , sick , weak , hated old man .
In the mud .
Have you forgotten all the talks we've had together , the vows we made to be like sisters to one another , all the hours we spent together , wishing that we never had to say goodbye , have you forgotten ?
I must and will have Katherine for my wife .
Brother John Bates , isn't that dawn breaking over there ?
How amazing !
What is it , my dear Bianca ?
Why , that man is a total fraud and rascal .
I'm saying it to the girl who isn't here and doesn't hear me .
In that case I wish you were as good a man as a fish seller .
I won't trouble you so much as to wake you .
I'll cure you of your insolence , and I'm not going to give you a thousand crowns , either ! , Hey , Dennis !
You taught me language , and all I can do with it is curse .
Into my grave .
There never was a monarch better feared and loved than yourself , your Majesty .
What would I do besides good ?
No faithful subject ever rejoiced more at the discovery of most dangerous treason than I now rejoice that I was thwarted in a damnable undertaking .
Nah , I'll never be aware of my own wit , until I break my shins on it .
Good-bye .
Will it be chased away by bowing and scraping ?
The highest-ranking ?
The warships have sent a dozen messages tonight , one after the other , and many of the senators have been awakened and are at the Duke's already .
And still do , I swear by my hands .
And so farewell .
Why ?
Come on , sister .
O , everlasting shame !
You have to be my torchbearer for the masquerade .
Oh , was she now ?
What , are you afraid ?
I have received letters that say the same .
Good night , honest Iago .
Well , to be on the safe side , so I don't go back on my promise , I plan to get myself married to a wealthy widow within the next three days .
Come on , don't quarrel with us , good old man .
And yet I wouldn't want to be you , uncle .
Oh what a curse marriage is !
Sweet Phoebe , do not scorn me .
You're talking like some innocent girl who doesn't understand the ways of the world .
How ?
What in the world made you risk your reputation like this and become a street brawler ?
If he agrees , great .
Tell me , spirit , how's the king and his entourage ?
These were sweet omens !
Good morning to you .
Isn't it a pain that I can't choose or refuse anyone , Nerissa ?
I don't think he'd have any choice , my lord .
He's welcome here .
Even their clothes are unstained , and look fresher than before the storm .
Where is the number of our English dead ?
Do you maintain the same story ?
No , you should tell him to hold his hands !
Or you can pretend to settle your differences until this matter with Pompey is finished .
She'd laugh me right out of my body and kill me with her wit .
So can I .
My God , it's nauseating !
He sent a messenger ahead of him who arrived here so out of breath that he could barely speak his message .
On my honor and by my word , if you outstay the ten days , you will die .
I believe you , and I ask you to forgive me .
Good noble ladies , be brave .
Your case is most unusual , though the Venetian law can't stop you from proceeding. , Yes , so he says .
I'd rather have a handful or two of dried peas .
Is this true ?
In that case I'm afraid you're damned by both your father and your mother .
There , take it all back , plates , cups , the whole thing .
I wish I could see that man someday !
The merchandise you bring from Rome is too expensive for me .
Oh , my heart !
Goodbye , sir .
Is the single man lucky , then ?
Where should we meet ?
That's another sin arising from your ignorance : you bring ewes and rams together and make your living by their copulation .
If I had known this young man was his son , I would have tried harder to convince him not to fight .
What can I do for my lord ?
To get my poor , mad husband out from inside there .
I'll go to the right side .
Welcome , traveler .
Let's follow them .
You know what I intend .
Exactly .
And no one eat any onions or garlic .
The wit you flaunt is like a blunt sword , it can't hurt anyone , thank God. , My lord , I thank you for your many kindnesses .
Some of you go to Decius's house and some to Casca's .
That's true , my lord : I did get this ring from her .
If you weren't my brother , I'd leave this hand of mine on your neck until I'd pulled out your tongue for talking like this .
Where's that snake ?
My Lord of Warwick and my brother Gloucester , follow Fluellen at a close distance .
He was so sharp when he was in school .
Do you love me ?
For the sake of your father's memory , make peace .
Read the time there .
I can't talk now .
It's too late .
What do you wish ?
Good morning , General .
No , no .
Should we part , sweet girl ?
I also heard that your daughter spent eighty ducats in Genoa one night .
Yes , and you dared Caesar to fight the battle at Pharsalia , where he fought against Pompey .
Alas , our poor country !
The king of Naples , my arch-enemy , listens to my brother's request , which was that the king , in exchange for the respect and money paid to him , would get rid of me and make my brother Duke of Milan instead .
Is Would your Mightiness care to wash his hands ?
But who's that coming this way ?
Their hands and faces were all covered with blood .
Do you want my true opinion ?
But if Antony is alive , healthy , friendly with Caesar , and not Caesar's prisoner , I'll shower you with gold and pearls .
Well then , can't I act as Rosalind for you tomorrow ?
Go relax now .
Just like the rabbit , who lives where she is born .
Show her in .
Why do you go around in circles when you could get to the point ?
She shall not .
Come , shall we hunt some deer for dinner ?
And they've got their swords unsheathed !
Here .
Thisbe ?
For my brother Edward's sake .
Thanks , good Egeus .
If they march along unopposed , I will sell my dukedom for a sodden , filthy farm in that craggy isle of Albion .
The Jew will have justice .
Twenty crowns .
What else ?
The queen is here on special business , and her army has moved on .
May they relieve a sick old man's suffering .
If I default , he'll pay you .
Then my children will probably be illegitimate .
I have a good plan .
The boy was going to support me in my old age !
Well , the Shall we get moving ?
But since you're his scoundrel servant , I will .
Give me the death sentence and end all my troubles .
The bitter one is the other one , that's you.LEAR Are you calling me a fool , boy ?
I can confirm that all these shocking things are true .
Do whatever you want with it .
Be free and happy .
He must do this , or I'll recant the pardon I just delivered .
So please rest .
My lord ?
We three couples will celebrate with a sumptuous feast .
Go ahead , then .
I never saw my father in my life .
Damn it all !
There's music coming out of thin air .
Hang on a second .
But please don't let any of your people wake me up .
This pantomime was probably a summary of the play .
Even though I'm mad , I won't bite him .
Shame on you , Demetrius !
But they're siding with a better wrestler than myself .
Our leader is being led .
May Egypt drown in the Nile and all good creatures turn into poisonous snakes .
Look , here comes our honored hostess !
Or should I say it's her uncle ?
Now go to the door and stay there until I call for you .
Like her ?
Oh , Cleopatra !
My lord , I'll say goodbye now .
A soldier is just a tool , like his sword , unless he has your qualities , Ventidius .
Here , at your service .
Get rid of half your knights and go back to spend the rest of your month with my sister .
The only kind of tears you should shed in this case are the kind you might get from holding an onion to your nose .
The Lord keep him from the title of king !
What then ?
Oh , that's with worry .
No I don't , believe me .
I see that you are here , but I'd like you to go there and then come back again .
You can take your chances after dinner .
He is called Ensign Pistol .
Those are the things we pine for now .
Against my will , I've been told to bring you in to dinner." There's a double meaning in that .
The smell of leek turns my stomach .
Help me , angels !
Here come two of Duke Senior's pages .
Wake Duncan with your knocking .
Dat it not be de custom pour les ladies of France , I can not tell vat is To kiss .
Hold your tongue .
He's made me a Christian .
them brothers , friends , and countrymen .
You gave an excellent performance .
You are Dromio , you are my servant , and you are yourself .
I assure you , sir , there's nothing to be afraid of .
No harm was done .
He's full of wise sayings and up-to-the-minute anecdotes : that's the way he plays his part .
That's an oath of great power , and our fury must subside .
The actors are here .
Go to her and tell her for me .
I've hired five hundred almsmen to hold up their withered hands to heaven , praying for my pardon twice a day throughout the year .
Oh , will it never be day ?
But you don't look as if you bring good news .
That's the truth , sir .
All this" ?
Tomorrow , and then every day after that .
I hope you'll be a good father to me now .
Victory is with us .
Now , madam , undress and come to bed .
Gracious brother , I will go with them .
I have to stop you , Cimber .
The sky shows countless stars .
She has the stones on her , and the ducats." I know , all the boys in Venice are following him , yelling , "His stones , his daughter , and his ducats ! "
Here he is .
Since you asked , I suppose it's not bragging to say that we are .
Is your name Shylock ?
Dear lady , welcome home .
Before she began shedding tears all over her lovely face , she was the fairest creature in the world , and even now she has no equal .
But she , your subject , hates such a king .
England would be lucky to have this virtuous prince as king .
There's more knocking .
Yes , and one other place , if you'll only let me name it .
Swear you won't .
May a hot southwest wind blow on you and cover you with blisters all over .
Did you hear this , Gonzalo ?
Oh , Julius Caesar , you are still powerful .
There's no clock here in the forest .
Is he all right ?
The news is true , my lord .
Let's not get gloomy in our reminiscing , since there's no reason for sadness anymore .
I take all responsibility for my decisions .
Remove your armor , Eros .
Have you heard of me , most noble Empress ?
Go now , and pretend to be a friendly hostess .
Come , husband , let's go to lunch .
And I hope you won't think badly of me .
Separate me from life with your sharp teeth .
The horsemen stand frozen like candlesticks , torches in their hands .
The gold I gave Dromio is safe and sound at the Centaur , and the inn host says that Dromio has left and is looking for me .
Look who's coming : a young man and an old man , having a serious talk .
Read the will .
Relent ?
If even then they don't answer to your satisfaction , you can say that they're not the men you thought they were .
But the way he's divided the kingdom recently , nobody can tell which of the dukes he favors more .
In a time like this , it doesn't make sense to criticize every offense .
Macbeth is ripe for the picking .
So how short am I , you painted barber pole ?
At five o'clock he's going to pay me for it .
Yes , they have .
Do you mean the king ?
Answer me in a word .
Now get out of here !
Hello , good sir .
Don't say anything bad about wine anymore .
There were many even more memorable feasts .
I wish I were in an alehouse in London !
Now I'm alone .
And what about him , Tranio ?
I'm going to laugh myself to death over this silly monster .
I admit that he's murderous , lecherous , greedy , lying , deceitful , violent , malicious , and guilty of every sin that has a name .
Make the best use of this information you can .
You swore to me when I gave it to you that you would wear it till you died , and that it would be buried with you .
No one passing by ?
Yes , Lepidus .
But I will go out , for these bad omens apply to the world in general as much as they do to me .
I'll wake him , because that's my job .
Swords don't frighten me .
Oh , how brave of you !
This is for your master's sake , not mine .
What did he say ?
I'll obey you until I can make bail .
You look like you have something more to say .
He doesn't know he's been appointed governor yet .
Your head , my lord ?
Oh , the sixpence you gave me last Wednesday to buy leather goods for my mistress ?
Hail !
Oh , Cassius , I'll run far from this country to where no Romans can find me .
Don't you recognize me , father ?
Thank you very much .
Who's shouting ?
I'm not well .
Jailer , keep an eye on him .
I want to speak with Clarence , and I came here on my legs .
No , no .
The reasons for his death are recorded in the Capitol .
My God !
If I had only died an hour before this event I could say I had lived a blessed life .
I know her by her walk .
Most kind messenger , tell great Caesar that through his deputy I kiss his conquering hand .
What evil and deceitful mirror made me think I could rival Hermia's starry eyes ?
Wait , look !
You need not kneel to me .
He hasn't told this to the king , has he ?
I knew a girl who was married in an afternoon as she went to the garden for parsley to stuff a rabbit .
I'll tell the Queen the reason for our quick departure and get her permission to leave .
You would run away from a bear , but if the only way to run was into the stormy ocean , you'd turn around and confront the bear .
Good night .
Why are they shouting ?
I'm indebted to you .
But you'll have to catch me !
I'm not that stupid .
I think all tendencies to jealousy were burned out of him by the sun of his native land .
We're wandering in a maze .
My good King , surprise the English and let them know what kind of kingdom you rule over .
Sorrow interrupts all hours and seasons .
Spoken like a gentleman .
How's everyone in Verona ?
You didn't offend us , you offended the king .
My sister is all those things , or else she should be .
But let him come .
And like I am for Rosalind .
He exposed Edgar's murderous plot , and was wounded , as you see there , when trying to apprehend him .
He will show me the part of heaven where the bachelors sit , and I'll have fun there forever .
He's fine and healthy , madam .
And anything else ?
That's strange .
Well then , leave them alone until they're sober .
Look how your servants wait on you , each one ready to do whatever you command .
I know it's the moon .
You've seen these illusions .
Ah , here comes my messenger. , What's going on , you crazy spirit ?
For God knows how many healthy men will shed their blood in support of whatever you persuade me to do .
I'm putting myself in God's hands , and with his help I plan to fight against the secret plot that caused this treasonous murder .
From now on I will , cousin , and I'll think of all kinds of games for us .
Because I didn't want to watch while you gouged out his poor old eyes with your cruel fingernails , or while your vicious sister sank her fangs into his sacred flesh .
Yes .
He's bound to Octavia .
Ma'am , my master's coming .
But I'm sure he'll get even with you .
It's two o'clock now .
Well , he's alive .
Well , so-so .
We'll bring him to his house with shouts and celebration !
Anything your Highness suffered in that disguise , I beg you to see it as your own fault and not mine , because if you'd been what I took you for , there would have been no offense .
No .
I won't sleep until I've delivered your letter , my lord .
What do you have to say , noble friend ?
Your overwhelming kindness makes me weep .
The court has sent for us .
All I ever did was tell him how hurtful and bad it was .
Come with me to see the duchess .
And smelled like that , too ?
Yes , boy .
I've come to say farewell to my king and master .
I don't expect him to answer for me , and yet I'm determined to fight vigorously for him .
Give me your hand .
When an evil thing has been lost , no one cries .
Thank you , sir .
Pay attention .
Who's the spokesman for Edmund , Earl of Gloucester ?
Indeed , they say that the senators plan to establish Caesar as a king tomorrow , and he'll wear his crown at sea and on land everywhere except here in Italy .
I hate the Moor , and there's a widespread rumor that he's slept with my wife .
Pick up the corpses .
I was with the heroes Hercules and Cadmus once , when their Spartan hunting dogs cornered a bear .
What features ?
I've looked at many ladies with pleasure , and been
Come here , monster , put some glue on your fingers , and carry away the rest of these clothes for us .
Cassius , go to the next street and divide the crowd .
You're famous for it .
This one , and I will give her to you .
Me too , Lord !
I am glad he's coming , however he's dressed .
Dromio , what stuff of mine did you put on a ship ?
Do so .
What's the news , my good friends ?
If it's that important , then let the women die .
I know you'll offer nothing less than that .
My God , this is unbelievably strange .
But I'll see you soon .
Yes , my lord .
All of them ?
My memory is hazy , more like a dream than a recollection .
All your talents and gifts didn't arouse as much envy from him as this one quality did , though to me it's far from your best attribute .
He has epilepsy , a disease where you fall down .
My friends told me as much , and I knew it , too .
I took their stings too , wouldn't you say ?
May heaven bless you .
Pardon me but I do not know what is "like me." An angel is like you , Kate , and you are like an angel .
Why do people love you ?
I'll be getting my own figures together in the meantime .
Is this the Prince's brother ?
And throw this dead peasant into the manure pit. , Regan , I'm bleeding .
What support did we have besides our father ?
Indeed , we have many good days to look forward to !
Put on a happy face , and welcome your friends .
The two of us together will sing like birds in a cage .
Around three or four o'clock , look for news from the meeting hall .
Finally , after shaking my arm a little , and jerking his head up and down three times , he sighed like it was his last breath .
It must go like this .
I'll do everything I can for you , Cassio .
You'd better knock louder .
No , please don't hate him , for my sake .
You'll see .
Murellus and Flavius have been punished for pulling scarves off statues of Caesar .
Oh , your contemptible lady !
Maybe he won't see me .
In a way , I mean .
I think so too .
Regan gives good advice .
I swear , sir , you did not eat at home .
Enliven them with yours !
Shut up , fool !
When the barrel's empty , we'll drink water .
This stormy night will turn us all into fools and madmen .
Your Grace can do whatever he wants .
Don't wake her .
I don't want to be cured , boy .
Here's the money you asked me to hold .
Or tell me , my sweet love , what you'd like to eat .
No , with Demetrius .
He said my eyes and my hair were black and , now that I think of it , he scorned me .
At this very minute an old black ram is having sex with your little white lamb .
Mine wasn't wearing a bridle .
Against my will , I've been told to bring you in to dinner .
Okay , just do this , noble Catesby : sound out Lord Hastings , but make it seem as if you're just mulling over the idea , that it hasn't been firmed up yet .
But never mind .
But I won't leave this spot , no matter what they do .
Look , here's the necklace .
and affection , even if it's just an act .
And can a person ever have too much of a good thing ? , Come on , sister , you can be the priest and marry us. , Give me your hand , Orlando. , What do you say , sister ?
With half the world opposing the other half , it wasn't the time for Antony , the pivotal player , to let love distract him .
They really wish they were somewhere else , but they want to descend on us , looking fierce so we'll think they're brave .
I'm completely lost .
Wait !
Such exercise !
Who can say I mean just her when all her neighbors are exactly like her ?
Madam , madam , Antony's dead !
No , villain , but you didn't work alone .
Yes , at Philippi .
Of course I will .
And so she turns men inside out and never acknowledges the integrity and merit that a man has .
I'm not sure , my lord .
Yes .
Here's to Caesar .
They couldn't , they wouldn't .
He's not sick , my lord , but he's very upset , and his problems are serious .
Let it end , or let me die so I won't have to watch any more of it .
Everything except something to live on .
I think it is , sir .
And then ?
Please , sir , be kind to me and tell me .
I wouldn't dream of opposing such an obviously promising idea .
Maybe it's a parade to welcome us to town , master .
We will .
But since , To get back to the matter at hand , what do you think of our proposal ?
Who are you ?
What's up , Catesby , what does your master say ?
You and I , Kate , we are the makers of custom , and the freedom that goes with our position silences all who would criticize , as I will silence you for upholding the prudish custom of your country in refusing me a kiss .
So , thank God , there is no real need for me , as I wouldn't be able to help you much .
But in the meantime , just assume that I'm paranoid , as I'm pretty sure I am , and keep thinking she's innocent , please .
I can see what's in broad daylight .
Please , leave me alone .
Go , and hurry back to bring us her reply and news of her state of mind .
You can't tell a story simply when it's a lie .
Will you dine with me tomorrow ?
Some villain has told lies about me .
I said "your husband." , Do you understand that word ?
O Phoebe , Phoebe , Phoebe !
Who am I then ?
The lack of time and the risk I'm under will have to keep us from bonding and catching up on each other's news the way we usually would after not seeing each other for so long .
I hate it when I hear a blustery actor in a wig tear a passion to shreds , bursting everyone's eardrums so as to impress the audience on the lower levels of the playhouse , who for the most part can only appreciate loud noises and pantomime shows .
It's true .
I loved him , as much as any father ever loved his son .
How are you , sir ?
His military ability is double that of the other two .
He's as smart as they come , but just a jester .
The honest men .
Put on your nightgown , in case someone comes and sees that we're awake .
But what about the bloody handkerchief ?
Why shouldn't she take my hand , father ?
It seems not .
What ?
But maybe you don't like mine , or his , or hers either .
Good night .
They're lying over there , and the poor old man , their father , weeps so piteously over them that the whole audience has joined him in grieving .
Margaret , run into the sitting room .
She sees you with the eyes my daughter lent her , it's true .
Yes , she did tell us .
Well , let's go on .
It means being faithful and ready to serve , just like I am for Phoebe .
You have guessed exactly what I feared .
I'll tell him right away , my lord .
Oh , that's nothing , believe me , sir .
Noble friends , let's kill him boldly but not with anger .
Now I will have to send my humble proposal of peace to that young man .
I tricked your own eyes .
Go ahead and ask her .
I was about to swear that I loved you .
Since you love money and power so much , I won't be your wife .
And why are you so pale ?
It's pathetic to be Caesar .
I honor him for being brave .
I can't help remembering the things that were most precious to me .
Captain Macmorris , I beg your pardon , but would you grant me a discussion or two with you , see , partly touching on or concerning the practice of war , the Roman wars , for the sake of argument , see , and friendly conversation ?
Are you my son ?
Decius , go tell them that Caesar won't come .
Well , then , help me .
The other half goes to the state .
Edward's sons have been carried off by the angels and Anne , my wife , has bid good night to the world .
What on earth does that mean ?
It sure is .
Good riddance ! , Close the curtains and leave. , I hope everyone who looks like him will make the same choice .
Then you told a lie , a sick , wicked lie .
I'm the king himself .
Horns ?
Yes , you're right , her name is Margery .
In this letter you'll find details of her illness and other , more serious matters that concern you .
Lepidus is red in the face .
I don't wish that on you .
God and your work be praised , victorious friends .
Well , enjoy the sweetness of deep sleep .
No , just listen to me .
If she's a traitor , why then , so am I .
I did .
Set it down .
I like her more than I can say .
I'm not afraid of anyone but him .
Is he attacking the heartland of Poland or some frontier ?
And when will that be ?
It's too hot .
What's going on ?
Stand and fight , you overdressed servant , fight !
I'm so crazy about you !
I'm very uncomfortable , and that won't help my case .
That really would be kind .
Would raise babies and clip coupons .
Do I , sir ?
Ophelia , come here. , I hear him coming .
Your authorization is ready .
Right on time .
My lord and brother , God save you .
My lord , I know what I'm saying .
Good luck .
God bless you , sir .
You take my life when you take away my means of making a living .
Swearing is for priests , cowards , overly cautious men , feeble old people , and those long-suffering weaklings who welcome abuse .
Portia , goodbye to you .
No , I'll be patient .
But what danger we'll put ourselves in , two young , innocent women traveling so far !
Hunt them down .
Call my knights together .
I loved one speech in particular .
But a terminal disease requires extreme treatment , or nothing at all .
And for the sake of those you grieve for , do me a favor : tell me the full story of what has happened to you and them , up to this point .
Let's say I didn't kill them .
But , my lord , this boy was born in the forest and has been schooled not in the usual subjects but only in magic .
It means being filled with fantasy ; with passion and wishes ; with adoration , loyalty , and devotion .
He's a stylish man .
Absolutely not .
Oh , she's ten times nicer than her father is mean , and he's the height of crabbiness .
I know the burden of hosting him is both an honor and a trouble , but that doesn't mean it's not a trouble just the same .
And if our navy wins tomorrow , no doubt our army will do their part .
May you die of the worst disease !
But I can't play a melody .
You sing , and I'll dance .
Take that , and that !
I swear , he'll be food for the crows soon .
Give me the daggers .
Come with me .
Thankfully , we have reason to cool our raging lusts .
I will not take it .
If he stays in this country he'll be found .
I'll torment them all till they roar with pain .
We've advanced too far .
The earth has bubbles , just like the water , and these creatures must have come from a bubble in the earth .
Take me to Octavius .
I saw the handkerchief .
You will listen to me .
Whatever else happens tonight , I hope the king escapes safely !
Indeed , honor is what I want to talk to you about .
There wasn't any problem .
Oh , if you only knew how close to success you are , even while you make fun of what I'm telling you !
I'll think it over .
Yes , indeed , bring them before me .
What Tranio did , he did at my command .
Do you like me , Kate ?
Come on , "nothing" will get you nothing .
Being too old to marry someone young .
Mountains don't tremble , however much the wind may blow !
Sometimes I'll turn into fire !
No I won't , even if you were one of the worst demons in hell .
The poor rude world doesn't have her equal .
Indeed , my lord .
Tubal , a wealthy Jew I know , will supply me with the cash .
Let me play the lion too .
And look how he's repaid poor Clarence for his loyalty , penned him up like a pig being fattened for slaughter .
I explained how you were deceived , how you were thwarted , the things that were used against you , who was working against you , and a lot of other things that would convince even a half-wit or a crazy person to say , "Banquo did it ! " You explained it all .
What do you think I should do ?
Oh , then I guess she was old and gentle , and you rode barelegged , like an Irish yokel .
Goodbye , gentlemen .
Are you good or evil ?
Didn't I tell you to meet me outside and bring these morons with you ?
You make me so happy .
It has been done already , and the messenger is on his way .
You're in a good mood tonight , my lord .
I'm as commanding as she is proud , and when two raging fires meet , they end up consuming the very thing that kindled them .
Let's go find him and cheer him up .
If she won't tell Benedick , someone else should .
Oh , Caesar , this Charmian lived until a moment ago .
And when that time comes , then you can mock me , but please don't pity me , because I won't pity you .
Borachio .
What havoc have you wreaked in this part of the forest ?
I'm sure he will stay under control .
Whose tongue ?
I'll get the general's surgeon .
Where is your husband ?
Can a man do it ?
And you're all sizzle .
Why are you looking for me ?
I can't admit that , since you'd have to compare his excellence to mine .
He can't give his house away to his daughters , leaving himself without shelter .
That's why I praise myself , who , if I do say so myself , is quite praiseworthy .
Get to the point , since we already know the truth .
No , sit down .
Fight valiantly today .
He'll be like this for a little while .
Get over it .
Then right next to him I saw the murderers , dripping with blood , their daggers rudely covered in gore .
My poor husband , my dear Edward !
What evil things were done to us that we were driven here ?
If we're Hello , Monsieur Le Beau .
Bring him with us .
But
I'm sending you to England on diplomatic business , and Hamlet will go with you .
They
Therefore , all lovers should speak for themselves .
He is what he is .
I'm more anxious watching you fight than you are in the fight itself .
Antipholus , you hear how the man pleads with me .
Madam , not yet .
Where is she now ? , What , will my hands never be clean ? , No more of that , my lord , no more of that .
Yes , my lord .
I thank you all .
If you ever had a mother , come in quickly to Sir John .
You'll see shortly how the murderer wins the love of Gonzago's wife .
Please stop turning me around .
He's an important person .
Be convincing .
There's no place I'd rather die than here by Caesar , and no manner of death would please me more than being stabbed by you , the masters of this new era .
Fulvia ?
Stanley , what news do you have ?
I'm not .
And you can't put your heads together and figure out why he's acting so dazed and confused , ruining his peace and quiet with such dangerous displays of lunacy ?
Like love , my lord , before it learns to love .
They say they have letters for you .
I do hate
They have to stay there .
Good Prince , say something !
Didn't you talk to it ?
Nothing , Messala .
If she rants , I'll tell her that she sings as sweetly as a nightingale .
God gives you one face , but you paint another on top of it .
And you , And how are you liking the shepherd's life , Master Touchstone ?
Shall Kate be my wife ?
Oh earth , which soaks up this blood , revenge his death !
Wake up , sir , wake up .
Let my sorrow have the upper hand .
I wish you had told me you had a different father .
Poor Tom will take you there .
It seems to me that your voice has changed , and that your speech is more elegant than it used to be .
Where are my good fellows ?
Well , get out of here then !
But I have to remember that I'm here on Earth , where doing evil is often praised , and doing good is sometimes a stupid and dangerous mistake .
Well , well , well .
Cheer up , because I think you're going to hell .
Yes , they're spirits that I've called out of their prisons to perform my whims .
It's the same with men .
Speak .
Launcelot , what's going on ?
She's full of good advice .
Doors , open up for whoever is knocking !
I'm still young enough to see without glasses , and I don't see what you're talking about .
Only describing what you have ruined .
What are you reading , teacher ?
Where are you , keeper ?
Why do you pity him ?
But let's stop this drinking and get down to business. , God forgive our sins ! , Gentlemen , let's get down to business .
Yes , that's it !
I am nothing but a poor , used fool .
I was wrong to her , Do you know how an oyster makes its shell ?
Because it will make you angry , and that will get me another beating .
And I'll be eternally grateful to you .
I'll put her on that .
Terrible .
What an excellent idea , he'll soak up the wine !
We'll perform all the holy rites .
This fellow will out-talk us all .
Between whom ?
God doesn't need to use indirect or illegal means to kill those who have offended him .
Bring him here dead or alive within the next year , or get out off my land .
Don't be crass. , You all look confused .
It makes me very happy to hear he's so interested .
Did you say Cassio ?
That's the one part of my service on land I do deny .
I don't want to hear you sing .
Tell her that the entire East shall call her Queen." Then he nodded and solemnly mounted an armored warhorse , which neighed so loudly it effectively silenced anything I might have said in reply .
As for your coming in to dinner , just do what you feel is right .
I love my master , and he'll find me very hard-working .
Seleucus' ingratitude makes me wild .
Soundly , my lord .
Don't laugh at me , but I swear I think this lady is my child Cordelia .
Caesar and Antony have always achieved more by delegating authority to their officers than by leading their troops in person .
Whatever we decide to do .
I'm hoping for better .
No , absolutely not .
This dream has been interpreted all wrong .
My lord , it's news I wish I didn't have to report .
If arguing makes us sweat , the real trial will turn that water to blood .
How can you blame her , a tender young maiden still given to virgin blushes , for objecting to having a blind , naked boy appear before her ?
Usually that means a person is foolish .
I hear that Edgar , Gloucester's exiled son , is with the Earl of Kent in Germany .
What's done is done .
Why , so did you .
But though I was born here and should consider that tradition part of my own heritage , I think it would be better to ignore it than practice it .
What is there left to do ?
It's good we had this meeting .
Why shouldn't I ?
What's he talking about ?
It's good if you love Hero , because she's worthy of your love .
I know exactly how to proceed .
And so do I. I think we all do .
This box was tested in the fire seven times .
Rulers abuse their power when they separate it from compassion .
My sword will talk for me .
Are you sad about that ?
What you say is true .
Even if marrying her meant I died .
They told me I was everything .
Before sunrise tomorrow , we'll kill anyone who escaped today .
I like him very well .
Oh no !
He was somewhere in the middle , between them.. .
It just appeared before them and marched past them with slow dignity three times , a staff's distance from their amazed eyes , while they turned , quaking with fear and too shocked to speak .
I wish the lightning had burned up all those logs that you've been ordered to stack !
I'm my own spokesman .
What is his name ?
If you took a good look at yourself , or if you thought about this more carefully , your fear would teach you to act more cautiously .
If you continue treating Hermia so badly , you'll pay for it .
Ariel , you've done your work exactly as I ordered .
Don't joke about this , Enobarbus .
Or was it just your whim , on your own initiative ?
No , I'm begging you now , tell me who it is .
It means being full of sighs and tears , like I am for Phoebe .
May good fortune come to you , good Petruchio !
Can we have some water please here ? , Come and wash , Kate , make yourself at home .
We'll take you there .
Where does he sleep ?
Amen !
Come , sit , sit , and sing me a song .
So I guess it's you , you silver treasure house .
I'm surprised my bland husband didn't meet me on the way here .
We came into the world as brother and brother , so now let's enter hand in hand , not one before the other .
The night has been chaotic .
I was a reasonable man , then I became a fool , and finally a beast !
Self-love , my liege , is not so great a sin as self-neglect .
Now , by the world , It's full of your ugly wrongdoings .
Your lily-white lips , your cherry-red nose , and your buttercup-yellow cheeks are gone , gone forever .
So when should he come ?
You think I'm a sponge , my lord ?
Silence !
Where's your master ?
Who was with them last ?
Has it come to this ?
That's the truth .
Absolutely everything .
A spirit ?
Afraid that your anger would not subside , she sent you word she was dead .
Oh , it's too terrible .
And did you leave him like this ?
Hello !
I bet it's a love letter !
What's going on , Dromio ?
So cheer up .
My lord , I'd want to have the gift you promised me on your honor : the earldom of Hereford and all the possessions that go with it .
Tell him that when our noble father , the duke of York , gave his three sons his blessing , he never imagined that our friendship would come to this .
Where are you , Pindarus ?
Why should that name be proclaimed more than yours ?
He is coming .
Will you come to bed , my lord ?
But you turn that sun into a shadow .
Ma'am , I'd rather , I know your lady Goneril doesn't love her husband .
Oh , and I know who loves him .
At the bottom , any change is for the better .
What is it , sir ?
I hope to make the sender blush for it .
My brother has a daughter who looks exactly like Hero ; this girl is heir to both our estates .
I don't know .
And this is the man who has now become a god , and I'm a wretched creature who must bow down if Caesar so much as carelessly nods my way .
That way , the maiden that stood between me and them shall be the means of my achieving my desire .
The river in Monmouth is called Wye , but the name of the other river has gone out of my head .
To work as a servant .
If I tremble then , you can call me a little girl .
I'm very glad to see you .
Isn't that the king ?
Until that happens , let me be who I am and don't try to change me .
But he would feel even better if I could tell him that you had left Antony and put yourself under his protection .
It's too bad I'm so hard-hearted , because I really don't love anyone .
Come in out of the storm .
Didn't I tell you she was innocent ?
Tell me to tear up this contract .
If he's ready now , so am I .
I can arrange it so that at some indecent hour of the night , she looks out Hero's bedroom window .
Pompey is making the most of our absence .
Oh , madam , madam , madam !
Goodbye , nymph .
I've noticed that they always like to settle and mate where the air is the nicest .
I remember the first time Caesar ever put it on .
If we are slated to die , the fewer , the better for our country , and if we're slated to live , the fewer men , the greater the share of honor for each of us .
And last night at dinner , you got up abruptly and paced back and forth with your arms crossed , brooding and sighing , and when I asked you what was the matter , you gave me a dirty look .
Well then , you have good reason to be sad .
Is it "chaste in word and action" ?
I can't imagine what's made him so unlike himself , other than his father's death .
Cassio's not dead ?
You ass !
Oh noble lord , consider your lineage .
I'll talk to you again tomorrow .
Now I must return to the wedding .
Dear gods , bless this couple , since you're the ones who have shown us the path that led us here .
Kent's been banished just like that ?
My lord , I will help you , even if it means I have to stay awake for ten nights straight .
It's my men who should call me "lord." I'm your man , your fellow .
Here's the hut , my lord .
I definitely will .
I'll bet my life that he only wrote this letter to gauge my love for you , and for no other reason .
Forgive me .
Those who have known how bad things are here on earth .
For Hecuba !
She's no longer my daughter , and I'll never see her face again .
You may , Mark Antony .
What is the matter here ?
That whore ?
My dear lord , if it was you who conquered her and took her virginity , I know what you're about to say .
If she gave you as much lip as she gives me , you'd be sick of her by now .
How about it , Corporal Nym ?
to have a stupid wife .
No , I'll walk right next to you , side by side .
Puppet" ?
I'll be bitter toward him , and curt .
Here .
If there's any good deed I can do that will bring you peace and me honor , speak to me .
You piece of filth , you're lying !
Lecherous Cleopatra , may all the charms of love soften those withered lips !
Thank you , sir .
Let's move again , my friends .
I don't think so .
If that's true , then don't be tongue-tied .
Tell me , what does he think of our situation ?
He hasn't done anything to harm you yet .
Disrespected in my own house by a spool of thread !
He does indeed show sparks of something like wit .
But if I were Brutus and Brutus were me , then I'd stir you up , and install in each of Caesar's wounds the kind of voice that could convince even stones to rise up and mutiny .
No ?
No , great king .
What , not even to pray ?
What do you think , girl !
That's the consideration that makes us stretch out our sufferings so long .
But , Lepidus , go to Caesar's house .
Yes , I guarantee he won't drown , even if this ship were as fragile as an eggshell and as leaky as a menstruating woman .
It's true I'm not married , Caesar .
My heart feels like it's full of poisonous snakes !
No Duke of spineless Burgundy can take this treasure of a girl from me now. , Say goodbye to them , Cordelia , even though they've been unkind to you .
The drink , the drink !
You'll just have to be patient for a little while .
It's weird .
Be patient , sir !
It's a good thing for you that , being castrated , you can better concentrate on my needs .
I'm too young to remember anything like it .
Do you have enough love for me to be patient when my bad temper , which I inherited from my mother , makes me forget how I should behave ?
I'm going .
Oh , heaven help us !
Do they come from good families ?
I'll do it with all my heart .
Lurk out of sight .
What's the treasure , uncle ?
So why aren't our eyelids heavy ?
You coward , did you run away from me ?
No , you won't get a word out of me .
A good reputation is the most valuable thing we have , men and women alike .
I wish that were true for both our sakes !
Caesar is listening .
Murderer !
Here's some more news coming in .
He will die .
Fair enough .
Reluctantly , I agreed-alas !
It's easy to err when left to our own devices , but criticism helps us to see our faults and correct them .
Well , is it not news that Petruchio's coming ?
We should all kneel before her , men of Cyprus !
If I saw twenty of the greatest powers that pay tribute to Caesar taking such liberties with her hand , what's her name now ?
It'll go away .
Mistress , you know about that .
And now you claim you gave it to a judge's clerk !
His soul is as dull as night and dark as the underworld .
Gentle gods in heaven , please let me die .
They've made many raids upon Italy , and the naval patrols go pale at even the thought of resisting them .
Where's Antony now ?
Your father was an extremely moral man , and religious people get odd ideas on their deathbeds .
Let tornadoes spew water until the steeples of our churches and the weathervanes are all drowned .
That woman who claims I am her husband , I loathe her in my soul .
It's expressly against the rules of combat .
The fractured world , in its confusion , should send lions into the city streets and humans into the wilderness to live in lions' dens .
I know how to tell when someone is alive or dead .
Look at me crying , what a fool I am to cry at what makes me happy .
The only reason they don't get punished and cured is that the disease is so commonplace that the nuthouse nurses are usually suffering from it , too .
Good-bye .
I'll never see the likes of him again .
They only feel the shadow of joy .
Let's follow him , Gertrude .
Speak , man .
Don't ask me anything .
Come , blade , drench my breast with blood .
How are you , my ladies ?
Sir , fifteen days of March have gone by .
Do you know the way to Dover ?
Who delivered it ?
So they are possibly Antony's friends .
Now you say it was "Knock at the gate" ?
Nature would produce its harvests in abundance , to feed my innocent people .
That he felt for me the love that I begged him to feel for you .
If my eyes aren't deceiving me , goodbye , love .
There is a particular lord who will watch you perform tonight .
Why , no , sir .
Tell him we could have driven him back at Harfleur but thought it unwise to burst a pustule before it had fully ripened .
I want more uncles here to welcome me .
God pardon those who are responsible for Clarence's troubles .
There's a fool sharing my bed now .
Here they come .
Please , my lord , call her back .
Please , Horatio , go with him .
Goodbye .
Tom will chase them off. , Go away , you mongrels !
Up and down , up and down , I will lead them up and down .
It was just removed from from the heart of , oh , she's dead !
Let me go .
Nature took Helen's Cleopatra's majesty , The best of Atalanta , And unhappy Lucretia's modesty .
I swear I will never break this promise of love .
I'll teach you to drink hard by the time you leave .
He'll be a good governor .
But I don't worry about being deceived because I don't need to trust .
Help me , ladies !
She was here just now .
Please tell me , who is this man ?
I can't believe that .
I'm sorry I said anything .
Leap and dance for him .
The hell with her !
So , are you done ?
Oh , Antony !
For Brutus's sake , I am indebted to you .
If you're going to die , be quick about it so you can catch the king's departing soul or follow him , like obedient subjects , to his new kingdom of endless night .
Get out of here , you horrible ghost , you hallucination .
Damn it all to hell !
Okay .
Please don't be angry .
Well , if you have to go , you have to go .
But regarding what happened between us , don't ask , I can't tell you .
The main body of the army is expected here any hour now .
But don't be easily won over .
Oh , my dear mistress , I won't be able to finish this work until sunset at the earliest .
Which is the lady I'm supposed to marry ?
He has always loved Cordelia best , and his bad judgment in disowning her now is obvious .
Be quiet for a while. , Robin , take off his donkey head. , Titania , get the fairies to play some music , and make these five people sleep more soundly than humans have ever slept before .
Oh , so cruel !
Beauty is a witch whose spells can turn loyalty into passion .
Good-bye , good Queen .
I know you .
No thanks , my good mother .
I've come to take you to the senate house .
I've proved my trustworthiness by giving myself a voluntary wound here in my thigh .
Let's follow the music as far as we can without leaving our station and see if it stops .
Is he alone ?
See , I've sealed his fate with this mark next to his name .
Oh yes .
You have a fat friend at your master's house : she took care of me in the kitchen today , thinking I was you .
You have forgotten , and you think it's a burden when I ask you to walk through the ocean , or run on the north wind , or do business for me underground when the earth's frozen solid .
Take off my armor .
So stop hoping and wondering what I mean .
Why didn't you say "the swift steps" of time instead of the "lazy foot" ?
It took me two years before I had a single tooth .
Is he still alive ?
Farewell , good neighbor .
In my bedroom window there is a book .
I don't until you practice them on me .
Sometimes you get a bit too wild , and you let your voice get a bit loud and rude .
He thinks "G" is me .
Knock , sir ?
Well , we'll see how you act .
Shylock is my name .
Goodbye .
I tell you , they are not honest men .
The oars were made of silver , and the oarsmen rowed in time to flute music .
Doesn't anyone else want to see this , and hear breath wheezing out from broken ribs ?
Are you still set on marrying my brother's daughter ?
One smile from him would repair my decayed beauty .
Are you going to get me in trouble ?
I took the hint and spoke to her .
And when I've sneaked up on my sons-in-law , then I'll kill , kill , kill , kill , kill , kill !
It's true .
Good afternoon , good gentleman .
How many things in life seem good to us because of when they happen !
This is exactly the false way that verses gallop along .
I'm amazed you're still talking , Signior Benedick .
You are my other self , my oracle , my prophet , my dear brother !
I don't want anything but that .
They left me and my servant there , tied together .
What kind of work is this , Charmian ?
It's Cinna .
I'm very glad .
You barely have the heart to tell me , so you can't possibly have the nerve to do it .
It's my birthday .
Where's your master , Dromio ?
The most important thing for you to think about is how beautiful his daughter is .
Where have you been , boy ?
It's sad , but Iago knows she had sex with Cassio a thousand times .
There's something else .
And yet I'll still have plenty .
Yes , she's young and tender .
The wine of life has been poured out , and only the dregs remain .
By the door .
Has your heart cooled toward me ?
Is she dead ?
Get out of here !
I didn't see them .
With anger , with fever , or with hunger , sure , my friend , but never sick with love .
Yes , my lord .
Get out of that position , because I can disarm you with my magic wand and make your sword drop .
We'll be ready when the time comes .
Are you joking ?
But I , who have never known how to beg and never had to beg , am starved for food , dizzy with lack of sleep , kept awake with curses and fed with brawling .
So there's a rift between Othello and Cassio ?
It was armed , you say ?
Curse my hand if it ever threatened an old man like you .
We're being haunted .
And you , sir , what's Well , compared to a fine workman , you might call me a mere cobbler .
What's that ?
Caesar and Lepidus declared war against Pompey .
You can see for yourself .
I don't like the way he's acting , and it's not safe for me to let his insanity get out of control .
Come on , kill me and brag about it !
No , you have to call me Rosalind. , Sister , you're coming ?
It's true that your son Lucentio here loves my daughter , and she loves him , or else they're putting on quite an act .
As clearly as I see you , my lord .
Bring me an exact report of the number of dead on both sides .
By the god Jupiter above , I swear "No." By Jupiter's wife Juno , I swear "Yes." They wouldn't dare .
My mistress , " I said .
Leonato and his brother .
So what's the story , old boy ?
So you're the only one who could play Pyramus .
Tell us , Othello .
Then you can hear my news , as dessert .
If you were the noblest of your family , young man , you couldn't die more honorably .
She sent Dromio to bring you home for lunch .
I would whip a guy for making a tyrant sound too tyrannical .
If not , leave me alone , and I'll stay away from your turf .
The advancement of your children , noble lady .
He's as ugly in his manners as he is in appearance. , I will indeed .
It's true , my lords , he did .
Every month he has a new best friend .
What disease is he talking about ?
She's an excellent , sweet woman , and there's no doubt that she is virtuous .
This is my treasurer .
Give him this deed and have him sign it .
Goodbye , then .
Save that kind of harsh language for your worst enemy .
The king won't live , I hope .
Mankind is so beautiful !
Come on , you're being too hard on yourself .
If they let you off , then we'll have to assume that Lady Justice has lost all her power .
Although you deserve praise , applause , and love , right now the duke misconstrues everything you've done .
Not offensive at all .
This is what happens when you act rashly .
What do you think about him , Cassio ?
You sent for me , sir ?
Sir , I tell you we believe you're both lying criminals .
Many times , madam .
Let me say first , madam , that he is well .
Give me your hand .
Oh , chest , obey me !
I've got my answer .
As sure as I'm standing here , I saw him .
We will , my lord .
You come with me , uncle of Exeter .
Then I'll know exactly what she is , just as I know what I am .
Because that's what you are now .
I could do without another toast .
I wish my eyes were
Both of which , master constable , You have .
Did he charge interest ?
I have a good eye , uncle .
Good !
Does anyone here know who I am ?
What you wanted is yours .
All I'm asking for is to have that little human boy as part of my crew .
I wouldn't stay here tonight for the entire town .
I'm going to sell all my land .
And weren't you the one who made him cheat on all of his other girlfriends , like Aegles , Ariadne , and Antiopa ?
Wait just a minute , you brazen hussy .
Now , don't forget , you promised me something .
I suspect his friends will join us .
I'll back you up .
Well , Oswald ?
And since we dream at night , time passes quickly then .
You are welcome here .
Good Volumnius , you know that we went to school together .
Oh , evil , evil !
It only looks a little paler .
May good luck follow you !
We don't doubt it .
You should know that to me , profit isn't more important than honor , but the other way around .
I'll meet you at your tent .
My own ears heard it , and you know it .
Will you go hide ?
Who's going to keep me from them ?
Never , my lord .
What's the matter with you , madam ?
May God reward you for your kindness !
I won't bother you .
When I opened my eyes , I saw their swords out .
There was no harm , I'm telling you .
Now , by my mother's son , and that's me , it will be moon or star or whatever I want before I'll travel to your father's house .
Amen .
The queen drinks to your good luck and happiness , Hamlet .
Pretend to be very concerned about both the Prince , who has compromised his honor by making the match , and Claudio , whose reputation will be ruined by this woman who's pretending to be a virgin .
Stop !
Give my love to my kind husband .
Your highness , could you send me on a mission to the ends of the earth ?
The Prince's fool" !
Welcome , dear Rosencrantz and Guildenstern .
Oh , Pomfret , Pomfret !
I'll go for a short walk to calm down my feverish mind .
Even if we said that this behavior suits him , though only a man with a perfect character could avoid being disgraced by such antics , there's no excuse for the extra work we've had to take on while he's been off amusing himself .
What did I do ?
I am a villain .
Here's the money you wanted , master .
She'll confirm everything .
Brown , madam , and she wouldn't want her forehead to be any lower .
No , I must let them find me .
Not at all !
I myself am playing the man in the moon , Well then , that's the biggest mistake of all .
Therefore tell me the Dauphin's mind frankly and without constraint .
The table is full on both sides .
Scratch my head , Peaseblossom .
Doesn't it look like the king ?
No , because we shouldn't be doing that , stuff .
He's walking ahead of me , and he keeps daring me to follow him .
What if I am ?
Dear Duke , please listen to what I have to say .
When asked the Duke and Duchess of Cornwall if I could take pity on the king and shelter him from the storm , they took my house away from me and ordered me never to talk about him , lobby for him , or support him in any way .
Well , lead on .
Farewell , kind lord .
You told me she got them , and that she promised to give me a little something in return soon , but nothing like that ever happens .
Are you insane , talking like this ?
Let's go find that hussy , Fortune , and and mock her till she starts distributing her gifts more equally .
Listen to the noble Antony .
Oh , darling Orlando , it's so hard to see you wearing your heart in a sling .
I could make the same boast even if I had a pig as my mistress .
Yes , but the clerk will never do it , unless he grows up to be a man .
Some startling news has just arrived , sir .
Go up there and second his petition .
I won't exhaust you anymore with idle chitchat .
She is not , madam .
I've set dangerous plans in motion , using lies , drunken prophecies , and stories about dreams to set my brother Clarence and the king against each other .
Listen , listen !
I needn't be ashamed of your Majesty , God be praised , so long as your Majesty is an honest man .
Say something .
Our regiments are full to the brim ; our cause is ready .
We're overjoyed to see you sane again .
Their bodies may remain here in England , but their hearts are encamped on the fields of France already .
Please , please tell me !
The level meadow , where the freckled cowslip , burnet , and green clover once grew , has become useless : unmowed , it grows to seed , so that nothing springs up but weeds , rough thistles , barren plants , and burs .
As far as I know , sir .
Here comes the herald of the French , my liege .
When he comes back from hunting , I'm not going to speak to him .
Baptista is a noble gentleman , one to whom my father is not completely unknown , and lovely as his daughter is , she is entitled to any number of suitors , myself among them .
Is Marcus Luccicos in town ?
Be quiet , be quiet .
Well , I can not tell how my difficult life has weathered my face , but I will never let those difficulties subdue my courage .
I love him dearly , and I shall continue to favor him .
I will not rise until your Highness hears me .
The gods have ordained it to be like this , sir .
Referee !
Oh , let her live , and I'll ruin her manners and her beauty .
First , Peter Quince , tell us what the play is about , then read the names of the actors , and then shut up .
Why are you chewing on your lower lip like that ?
Since the wall is conscious , it should curse back at him .
I had to send it to him .
Carry your master out .
His majesty is so concerned about my personal safety that he has ordered them to conduct me to the You're being arrested ?
Don't snap at me .
Caesar , I never believed in omens , but now they frighten me .
I don't like it .
You insolent rascal , what trade ?
Come on , you turtle !
I'm not in a joking mood .
No , not a chance .
Boy , I beg you to run to the senate house .
Come on , Iago .
We're here to say "amen" to that .
He was crazy to run away .
I've been tricked .
Most noble brother , you have done me wrong .
I pick the younger one .
Are you thinking about me ?
No , it was a little one , not more than a pint .
fast and pray to stave off temptations .
But please tell me more .
And yet , against all odds , I win her over !
That's enough for me , then .
March to the bridge .
Enough , Captain .
The only reason you left India was to come here and see that butch Amazon Hippolyta .
What has Caesar done to deserve your love ?
Stand away from the body .
My brave relative !
If luck's with me , I'll lose a father , and you'll lose a daughter .
I was never disloyal , and I never will be .
She said she loved me for the dangers I'd survived , and I loved her for feeling such strong emotions about me .
Just as tall as my heart .
I must join the duke for lunch .
Are these wind instruments ?
Well , anyway , goodbye .
My lord , you don't need to apologize .
Madam , with all my heart .
Evidence enough to deceive the Prince , anger Claudio , ruin Hero , and kill Leonato .
This letter is for you from Signor Antonio .
Was that him just now ?
Didn't you figure out that I left you because I hate you ?
It's yours , and you may hang us , your trophies of war , anywhere you like .
Yes .
There go the minstrels .
You have my friendship .
Lucius !
But if I ran away from the Jew , I'd be following the advice of the devil , who's the very devil himself .
Bassanio gave his ring to the judge who asked for it , and deserved it too .
It's Hortensio , isn't it ?
Maybe he's not feeling well .
Didn't you hear someone shouting ?
Why are you telling me this ?
Did you see the weird sisters ?
I humbly say goodbye .
Invoke his warlike spirit and that of Edward the Black Prince , your great-uncle , who fought a tragic battle on French soil , routing the French army in full force while his mighty father stood by on a hilltop , smiling to see his son steeped in the blood of French noblemen .
Some other time .
Indeed , the enemy nearly took the bridge , but he was forced to retreat , and the duke of Exeter holds the bridge .
The cold wind blows through the hawthorn trees .
Oh Lord , my spirits are tired !
Do this immediately , and send him packing .
Listen to you , instructing me like a parrot would .
He did , and he snatched my ring right off my finger .
All we do is sit and sit and eat and eat .
We're trying to be reasonable while you're so upset , and we understand that you're old , and, But Goneril knows what she's doing .
and patches of righteousness .
Shame , eternal shame , and nothing but shame !
No , my friends , don't please fate by giving it your sorrow as well .
Apparently so. , Cover their faces .
I saw a thousand shipwrecks , a thousand men whom fish had gnawed to the bone , huge anchors , chunks of gold , heaps of pearls , and precious jewels , all scattered on the bottom of the sea .
Call in the messengers sent from the Dauphin .
What do you say to a calf's foot ?
To put it plainly , I'm afraid I'm not quite sane .
Come , then , and send his body to Thasos .
This is It is , my lord .
What have you done ?
I swear I will , and if I ever break my promise let me turn into a monster .
Will you come ?
I'd swear he wouldn't leave it behind , or even take it off his finger , for all the money in the world .
Is it fashionable now for neglected fathers to get so little pity ?
If your Majesty would like , I'll muster up my friends and meet you wherever and whenever you like .
How excellent for Antony !
When they choose , they only know how to lose .
Oh , you should have done it without telling me !
I hope , sir , that you're not angry that I've been equally attentive to you both !
Dissolute lowlife , you shall die .
Then let's meet with our senior command and discuss what to do next .
Why , what did he do ?
Leave Hermia alone .
To find a husband for her sister .
Whatever happens to me , this is a soldier's kiss .
If we have sweet-smelling breath , I'm sure they'll say "it's a sweet play." Now no more talking .
Our army shall somberly attend this funeral and then depart for Rome .
Gold , silver , and common lead .
Why , to keep the eyes on the sides , so that you can see anything that you can't sniff out .
Will you be patient ?
I don't think about them now .
Bring him my head .
I'm a carpenter , sir .
Then she has no choice but to hate you , as you purchased her love with murder .
Please , let me review the contract .
So then , you must think that hairy men are honest and simpleminded .
Take his sword away from him .
Very pale , sir .
Take some memento from us as a token of our gratitude , not as a fee .
Guys who'd take her with all her faults , provided there were enough money involved .
To none but you , only to you .
But I'll punish them thoroughly .
Greet the king with a welcoming expression in your eyes , your hands , and your words .
But come , my lord , let's go .
Don't tug on my clothes .
Go ahead .
Until then , we've said enough .
Good night to you .
So be quiet .
Then Antony offered it to him again , and he refused it again ( though , in my opinion , he was reluctant to take his hand off it ) .
Partly to confirm my opinion and partly for the satisfaction , see , of my mind , with respect to the demands of proper military practice , that's the point ?
My dear sir !
Eros !
If I repeated it to you , it would kill you as soon as you heard it .
Yes , sir , we hope so .
I'll go my own way .
I love to argue with him when he's having one of these fits , because then he always has a lot to say .
Yes , " said my uncle Gloucester , "Small plants are graceful , while ugly weeds grow fast." And since then , I've wished I wouldn't grow so fast , because sweet flowers are slow while the weeds grow in a hurry .
Get out !
Please , all of you , stand up .
Here's to your health .
Go , then , mother , to your daughter .
If not , I'll leave you alone and that'll be the end of my business .
The human being unburdened by the trappings of civilization is no more than a poor , naked , two-legged animal like you .
What mercy can you show him , Antonio ?
You must be ready for revenge , too , when you hear me out .
My name is Petruchio , son of Antonio , a man well known throughout Italy .
Yes , I want it , and I'll get it .
I'm telling you this story for a reason .
From down here , I thought his eyes looked like full moons .
That's all .
Adieu .
Is this possible , my lord ?
There are lots of ways to get on the general's good side again .
But if you have the stomach for it , you'll have all the help from me you need .
Orlando , my lord , the youngest son of Sir Rowland de Boys .
There , take my fool's cap .
Is he sane ?
He's not himself because he feels so ashamed .
Deal ?
The graceful and renowned king is dead .
You stay on the left .
You'll be pricked all over , and it'll sting like bees .
What are we going to do , Enobarbus ?
My father instructed you in his will to give me a good education .
What do you want with me ?
If that's the case , tears wash my eyes more than hers .
I hope luck will give me what my heart hopes for !
Are you ill ?
No one will listen to it .
He really plays well .
When you see him walking by here ( as I'll make sure he does between twelve and one ) you can nab him .
Let me go , or I'll knock you on the head .
It's almost morning .
Oh , you men are made of stone !
Had the gods taken pity on us , I wouldn't be here calling them merciless .
Now start the music , and sing the solemn hymn .
Not me .
No .
You truly did .
Here comes one of them now .
Well , enough about them. , Come here , Catesby .
I'm not sure about that .
I do believe your Majesty takes no shame in wearing the leek on Saint Davy's Day .
You purple flower , hit by Cupid's arrow , sink into the pupils of this man's eyes .
Is he there in person ?
And yet I would have made her happy had our luck not been so bad .
What about you ?
Honestly , I didn't see it , but I felt it in her hot breath .
Can you remember the time before you came to live in this shack ?
Moron !
Doesn't my wit suit me well ?
I knew you'd turn out this way .
I wish you could !
They see , smell , and taste sweet and sour just like their husbands .
Tyrants themselves wept when they heard about it .
After a little while , I'll beat him too .
Take him away .
What's going on in here ?
I'll test it out .
No !
Where do I live ?
See how he stands between two clergymen !
It's a common What ?
You're helping the storm , not us .
That's a good song .
Indeed ?
My brother's love , the devil , and my own anger made me do it .
But you must learn to recognize such liars , or you will be greatly taken advantage of .
How ?
Listen to this , King : as soon as we sent those Irish soldiers running for cover , the Norwegian king saw his chance to attack us with fresh troops and shiny weapons .
I hope it works out for the best , Lepidus .
Can I have some ?
Hurry up , my Jewish friend .
He's called Modo and Mahu .
In his greatest need , even they will desert him .
Send the necklace to her , or send me with a token that will authorize her to pay me .
My husband will save me .
Well , good for him !
How is your majesty doing ?
That , stirred up by Dorset , Buckingham , and Morton , he's coming to England to claim the crown .
And before I make her normal again , I can cure her by treating her with another plant , I'll make her give me that little boy as my page .
Do whatever you like with it .
But enough about that .
Remember you !
Better , since your lordship was nice enough to ask .
Too bad about the son !
No , just to the gates of hell , where the devil will meet me , with the horns on his head like a cuckold , and say , "Go up to heaven , Beatrice .
Would I send a lie ?
Just as I told you , he usually sleeps in the afternoon .
Has she already forgotten her brave husband , Prince Edward , whom I stabbed on the battlefield three months ago in my anger ?
I swear to God I won't .
The Duke of Cornwall , my master and patron , is arriving tonight .
Stay down , heart .
We'll have the barber trim it later , along with your beard .
We're in God's hands , brother , not in theirs .
Here come Brabantio and the brave Moor .
It's terrifying .
I'll give the Jew my flesh , blood , bones , and everything before you lose one drop of blood for me .
We didn't please them on land .
We should definitely say something to the Moor .
Yes , like your horse , who , staggering under your boasts , would trot more easily if some of them dismounted .
But what's the upshot of her admiration ?
When he regained consciousness again , he said that if he'd done or said anything wrong , he wanted them to know that it was all because of his sickness .
Be kind and polite to this gentleman .
What , you look amused .
I wish I could see this invisible drummer .
That's a good point .
For Brutus , as you know , was Caesar's angel .
Let go of me .
And why are you noble , strong , and brave ?
They got what they deserved .
What's that noise ?
Good night , ladies , good night , sweet ladies , good night , good night .
All hail , Macbeth !
You'll never hear from the herald again .
Good-bye .
Yes , he is dead .
Oh , oh !
We know how much they suffer if we are unkind to them .
I want to avoid that .
The bearer of bad news is often blamed for it .
So why does it seem so particular to you ?
Don't believe any of us .
A house , a person ?
Good morning to you , friend .
Yes , for new lovers time passes ten times faster than for couples who've been married forever .
My own house , good lady .
Say no more .
I really don't know .
Help , Charmian , help , Iras , help !
Absolutely , yes indeed .
Only he acted from honesty and for the general good .
If you won't leave , then
I have as much of our father in me as you do , though I admit you're closer to him and matter more because you're older .
My mistress showed me you in the moon and your dog and your bush .
It has hatched a I go unwillingly .
Is it daytime ?
If you are a devil , I won't be able to kill you .
If her breath were as terrible as her words , she would kill every living thing from here to the furthest star .
And this is Metellus Cimber .
I say that I love you more than he does .
And what is that music ?
Royal Egypt , Empress !
Pity the hand that shed this valuable blood .
As for the rest of the ships , I scattered them , and they've gathered again in the Mediterranean , sailing sadly home to Naples , believing that they witnessed the shipwreck and death of their great king .
My name's Roderigo .
You've said it well .
No , not at all , sir .
Antony's wife should have an army to escort her , with neighing horses to announce her arrival long before she appears .
A boy robbed you , but you'll beat up the post instead .
To tell you the truth , I was just going to your house .
Here comes my wife now .
I know him .
Let them in .
Oh , I see , you will only part with lightweight presents .
I certainly do have him , but I wouldn't advise you to touch him .
Crude slaves with greasy aprons , rulers , and hammers shall lift us up so everyone can see .
In this world , I'm only taking up space .
Are you planning on showing me all your wit at once ?
Welcome , welcome to all of you .
Is he angry ?
As I sat on the shore crying over my father's shipwreck , I heard the music creep over the wild waves , calming their fury and soothing my own grief with its sweet melodies .
It's not manly to cry .
Oh , my lord , what do you mean by that ?
Fine .
You go ahead , and I will follow you .
Is your name Goneril ?
Where did you leave him ?
But what do I care about words ?
Let's hear what he has to say .
Give me what I deserve , and do your duty !
Goodbye to the soldiers and to the wars that make men great !
No , a woman's gentle brain could never have come up with such crude expressions and even harsher meanings .
But my personal motivation , and that which should move you most to sanction my departure , is that Fulvia is dead .
As a favor to Nope .
Tell me , don't you have a virtuous and lovely daughter named Katherina ?
You can't take anything from me that I care less about , except my life , except my life , except my life .
Which two crowns would those be ?
I'll be your wife if you'll have me .
We're done for !
Lord Hamlet. , Please let him be all right !
But his punishment was bitter death .
I feel my stomach squeezing up against my heart .
It's pointless to talk now .
No , keep going , old man ; don't stop like that .
That's Signior Baptista , will you really be this cruel ?
It's obvious .
You look happier already , and I'll be back quickly .
But I'm as noble as my opponent .
Ah , it's a sensitive animal , with a good conscience .
But I don't think it'll hurt him to tell the truth .
Didn't you send Lysander , as an insult , to follow me around praising my eyes and my face ?
I'm not in the mood .
We were somewhere where I couldn't pick a fight with him , but I've decided to wear it in my cap until I see him again , whereupon I'll give him a little piece of my mind .
Add defiance to all this and , by way of conclusion , tell him that he has betrayed the men who follow him , whose death sentence has been pronounced." My king and master's message delivered , my task is done .
Master , master , I've been on the lookout so long , I'm ready to fall down dead , but I've got one , finally !
Oh , let their bodies follow , my dear king , to win back what's rightfully yours with blood and sword and fire .
Help me out of here .
I tried to stop speaking plainly , since you dislike plain speech so much .
Right over to that I hope he enjoys her .
And if he fails at that , he will find other ways to kill you .
She'll be buried with her face upwards , then .
And who is that ?
Why would anyone flatter a poor person ?
The clock has chimed midnight .
Get out , you dark-skinned gypsy !
There are more than enough willing women around .
I swear to her that I haven't , but it doesn't change anything .
Be thrifty .
I'm Launcelot , who was your boy , is your son , and will be your child .
Come on .
My children would have enjoyed a better death if God had blessed you with a purer life .
Well , then , here it is : you must prepare yourself for his knife .
And from now on , when you get hot with me , I'll assume it's your mother speaking and leave it at that .
Yes , sir , and I'll leave when you ask me to .
Are you wise ?
We have to strike while the iron's hot .
The word is too good to represent her wickedness .
Is that true ?
When did you become so fond of singing , boy ?
Please , stop bowing , good sir .
He deserves a beautiful wife more than all the other men I've ever seen .
Don't I deserve more than this ?
I got it from you , I never said I didn't .
What's up , man ?
No , he just gets reality completely wrong .
Go to him , madam , speak to him .
Twenty crowns ?
Goodbye .
I'm determined to be heard by someone .
The criminal is the one who stole the nest .
I didn't refuse you .
Go back and tell your king I do not seek an encounter with him now but would be willing to march on to Calais without interference , for , to be honest , though it's probably unwise to confess this to a powerful enemy who has the advantage , my men are considerably weakened by illness , my numbers reduced , and those few men I have almost no better than so many Frenchmen , though when they were in good form , I tell you , herald , I thought three Frenchmen walked on every pair of English legs .
That's the way it should be , only Antony should conquer Antony .
Yes , and be wise .
Can I justifiably and in good conscience make this claim ?
I'll debate this with you later , and then I'll teach you to listen more carefully .
Why , last night .
I know my nails are stronger than my eyes ; I'll scratch them out .
He would have ?
But if you were married , you'd wield some influence .
Good-bye .
But I surrender all this magic now , when I've summoned some heavenly music to cast a spell , as I'm doing now , I'll break my staff and bury it far underground , and throw my book of magic spells deeper into the sea than any anchor ever sank .
My father loved Sir Rowland as much as he loved his own soul , and the rest of the world shared my father's opinion .
Just listen to him .
Happy indeed , the way we have spent the day .
Hamlet." Dutifully and obediently my daughter showed me this letter , and more like it .
I can't enjoy either of them as long as the other one's alive .
Oh , God help me !
Madam , some actors happened to cross our paths on the way here .
I don't owe her any duty , it's you that I submit to .
Just a minute ago I heard you say you didn't like it when Cassio left my wife .
Come , uncle Exeter , enter Harfleur .
We've finished our business .
Is that a lot of He says his name is Master Fer .
Sir , do you know who I am ?
The messenger arrived on my watch and is unloading his mules at your tent .
He's awfully proud , but his pride suits him .
Yes , if it doesn't stand still .
Look out , here she comes .
You should look like an innocent flower , but be like the snake that hides underneath the flower .
Call him .
his daughter , Katherine , with some insignificant , unprofitable dukedoms as her dowry .
Alas , he is too young .
His position is hopeless .
And now he's gone .
He leaves me to my own contentment , but that's the one thing I can not find .
I'll see you on the guards ' platform between eleven and twelve tonight .
Take revenge for his horrible murder , that crime against nature .
Don't dishonor your mothers !
Come down , look no more .
Yes , on his front .
I'm telling you , it's hers .
If you would have such a man , take me .
Yes , that's it .
Your true demonic features are distorting your body .
toward his own father who loves him so completely .
Ha !
Clearly , men should not go out walking too late !
You've done a good job , that other men can attribute their murders to you !
I don't feel like going .
Please , sir , be patient .
I wouldn't be the villain you think I am even if I were offered all of Macbeth's kingdom and the riches of the East too .
As you all know , overconfidence is man's greatest enemy .
You're up early .
Listen to my excuse .
Let's go .
Come , let's go to the dance .
My husband will never get a moment's rest , I'll keep him up at night talking about you until he runs out
Now this joke has turned serious .
Benedick , Beatrice praised your wit the other day .
Helena , it's not true .
Trebonius !
We're on a tight schedule .
His speech was like a tangled chain .
What's the news !
Welcome , lady .
She I can guess her answer .
Yes , and Wall too .
We'll have supper in the morning .
How many times will Caesar bleed again in show , though he now lies at the base of Pompey's statue , as worthless as dust !
And tonight , sir , I invite you have dinner with me .
You think he's special , since you've only ever seen him and Caliban .
Your mistress sent for me to come to dinner ?
Don't look so sour .
Play , trumpets !
You'll beat me ?
I have a wife I love .
No , my lord , it's been four months .
Kill Brutus and be honored by the killing .
Oh , God !
Right , and they wore proclamations around their necks , saying , "Be it known to all men by these The eldest of the three brothers wrestled with Charles , the duke's wrestler .
Shall I include hell as well ?
Now all my enemies are at my mercy .
No , not a bit .
Who can command the forest and make the trees pull their roots out of the earth ?
I'm sorry I was so wrong about him .
Oh , he's really gone .
Iago is gesturing for me to come closer .
What are you doing ?
Sure , and twenty others just like you .
It will be made even heavier soon , by the weight of a man .
Performing is activity , and he is always doing that .
We'll begin the ceremony the way we hope it will end , with delight .
My features are still that beautiful , or else you , the greatest soldier in the world , have become the greatest liar by overpraising them .
That's my sister .
Let's have one , good soldier .
In cash .
What things , my lord ?
Get out of here , you measly , lying wretch .
Gentlemen , let's go make sure Cassio's wounds are properly dressed. , Come on , ma'am , you can tell us another story .
I am being serious , my lord .
Antonio !
Everything I am and everything I have now belongs to you .
If he struggles , use force !
Right now ; as fast as she can say the vows .
Where have you been hiding ?
Pray well , father .
Do you need something ?
Then we'll go out , even to the marketplace , and , waving our bloody swords over our heads , let's cry , "Peace , freedom , and liberty ! " Kneel then , and wash .
Whether you bite to kill , Mastiff , greyhound , or ugly mutt ,
And I love Hastings with all my heart .
Where are his eyes ?
Who'd waste his time talking to such a stupid bird ?
Did this happen before the King of France returned home ?
In the place where souls recline on beds of flowers we'll walk hand in hand and amaze the other ghosts with our spirited demeanor .
What do you have to say to me now ?
Oh , poor shepherd !
Would you like to hear some music , my sweet love ?
If I know my own thoughts and desires , and I'm not dreaming or crazy , which I'm sure I'm not , then , dear uncle , I've never had so much as a half-formed thought that would have offended you .
Leave out the water .
Why are you so pale ?
Since you're giving me new assignments , let me remind you what you promised me but haven't come through with yet .
He mixed that poison himself .
Caesar , I'm telling you that Antony is dead .
I put my trust in you .
Saint Davy's Day has passed .
Call my sister that .
Then that's the way it may turn out .
Knock at the gate ?
And I am , I am .
Why should I stay , In this vile world ?
Not until we part as friends .
She gave it to him , and he gave it to his whore .
Tomorrow is the day .
Travelers have never told lies , no matter what the fools at home accuse them of .
Do you remember the circumstances ?
Now two things still need to be done .
You're perfect , without a rival in the world , made up of the best qualities of every creature .
No , don't press up against me .
What , you ?
I'm positively stuffed with air , I eat so much of it .
If you're going to lend us this money , don't lend it to us as if we were your friends .
Has any man seen him at the barber's ?
Was there ever a match put together so quickly ?
But are you sure that Benedick loves Beatrice that much ?
Don't let the Danish king's bed be a nest of incest .
My liege , this was my glove .
Be patient .
My uncle is king of Denmark , and the same people who made fun of him while my father was still alive are now rushing to pay twenty , forty , fifty , a hundred ducats apiece for miniature portraits of him .
Eighty ducats !
As you can see , these lovers are looking for a place to fight .
It's hard to see clearly in the dark of night , but it's easier to hear well .
Make your confession short .
There's more to this ring than its cash value .
What do you want to do , Desdemona ?
They're all welcome .
Now I see that you can't call anything good except in right context .
I think he's actually serious , and not just being polite .
I've been transformed somehow , haven't I , master ?
What's this all about ?
Don't you trust my sword and these wounds ?
Good .
All women would be angry with you for doing it , even though I'm the only one who's hurt by it .
A lively young one !
My lord , what are you talking about ?
Before I hear him , I want to decide some important issues that are on my mind concerning my throne and France .
I can get you five hundred ropes for that price .
My fortune , like that of many of us tonight , is to go drunk to bed .
What could I hope to get from you , who've got nothing but your charm to support you in life ?
It's a disgrace to us all .
Aren't you dead yet ?
Do you know them ?
A strange fish .
I couldn't see you , Lysander , but I heard your voice , and that's how I found you .
Truly , lady , you have a merry heart .
In heaven .
I think you came to see my mother's wedding instead .
Then hurry up and tell me what you want .
Yes , but not out of fear .
There will be a feast from five o'clock until eleven .
Sweet Desdemona !
Let's leave him .
He might have treated me like that , because I'm as unused to abuse as a little child .
Consider it done , my lord .
Something about Cyprus .
It's like a cockleshell or a walnut shell , a joke , a prank , a doll's cap .
Who's shouting ?
They were traitors .
A virtuous woman won't give her husband horns , and my Rosalind is definitely virtuous .
Yes , they are .
No , that's not it , it's because of what happens in the marriage bed .
Tie him up , I tell you .
An old Italian fox is never that generous , my boy .
children have lost , or no longer have time to learn , skills that should be a credit to our country .
But to tell you the truth , reason and love have very little to do with each other these days .
You are , but you don't know it yet .
We meant to tell the king that his orders have been carried out , and Rosencrantz and Guildenstern are dead .
Come , Katherine Queen of All , reveal your heart to me in broken English .
What's this ?
When Duke Frederick heard that great , worthy men were coming to this forest every day , he raised a large army to invade this land and fight his brother .
And why's that ?
Good heavens !
What was that cry for ?
All right .
Casca will tell us what's the matter .
Look , if you love me , stay .
If everyone here knows us but we don't know anybody , it's time , I think , for us to pack our bags and take off .
God forbid that I snatch the crown from him .
Oh , come on .
He is .
Cousins , you all have work to do. , Oh , I beg your pardon .
Is your master awake ?
But since the affairs of men are always uncertain , let's think about the worst that may happen .
I'm critical by nature .
It never occurred to me to imagine there was anything more to know .
Have a seat .
You lover of that damned whore , you're talking to me of "ifs" ?
Goodbye , sir .
Who's that ?
Yes , my lord .
What , is he scared of a gun that only fired a blank ?
Where's Antony ?
What's this ?
She has disarmed me .
Come on , envelope , open up for me .
I admit I'm only a woman , but nevertheless I'm the woman Lord Brutus took for his wife .
Could you really do such a thing , for all the world ?
Yes , please ; unleash your wisdom .
Well , what's your plan ?
After you , my lords ?
Yes , even if I had a thousand more pounds than that , for I hear that you are Me , too .
Oh , your report is too poetic , but it sounds so true !
Oh Portia , these are some of the worst words that ever stained a piece of paper .
You will not blame us in your funeral speech , but will say all the good you want to about Caesar and that you do it by our permission .
Thank you , master .
Then you must take the truth I have to tell like a Roman .
Come , come , we're worrying about the worst-case scenario .
I'm sorry to hear this .
Here comes young Mr. Ganymede , my new mistress's brother .
He did , and I gave it to him .
Would your highness like to take a walk ?
We're still waiting for one more .
No , my lord .
Why are you making these faces ?
Here , I'll tell you my whole plan in my carriage , which is waiting for us at the gate .
Do you know why the King of France suddenly went back home ?
One ?
Titinius , if you love me , get on your horse and spur him on until he's brought you to those troops and back again , so that I can find out whether those troops are friends or enemies .
Well , if you could have just an inch of better fortune than me , where would you like the improvement ?
What's the news abroad ?
I don't hear anything , madam .
You'd better get me But does he know that I'm here in the forest and dressed in men's clothing ?
I'd rather have lost my legs in battle than be a part of this !
I swear by my sword , Swear by your shield , too !
I often wander around in the woods like a forest ranger until the sun rises in the fiery red sky over the ocean , turning the salty green water to gold .
I long to be immortal .
I have so much care and pity for you that you could call me friend .
He and his daughter are captured .
And also to find out the size of the enemy army .
Oh , my lord !
Fool , speak well of yourself .
You're forgetting yourself when you back me into a corner .
So it's nearly the time when the ghost likes to appear .
Good words are better than bad strokes , Octavius .
Let's drink through midnight .
No , not tonight .
Who are you , coming so fast in this quiet night ?
Please , Rosalind , my sweet cousin , be happy .
All other devils who tempt people to treason patch together some motive , put together from shreds
Farewell .
I'll do everything a younger man could do for you .
Whatever you see first when you wake up , think of it as your true love .
There's no doubt that Petruchio's got quite a catch .
But never mind them , if Caesar had stabbed their mothers , they would've forgiven him .
Today shall always be remembered as a holy day .
What a shameless jerk you are to pretend you don't know me !
Our friends are all waiting for you .
Who's there ?
It's all I can do to keep myself from hanging my head down in despair and singing it like poor Barbary .
His beard was gray , right ?
Ah ha !
My father-in-law lives closer to the marketplace .
Is it them ?
You've come to face a ruthless enemy , an inhuman wretch incapable of pity , without any feelings of mercy .
Has she told Benedick how she feels ?
Does Leonato have a son , my lord ?
What , are you trying to make me crazy ?
Listen , please , give me the necklace .
The day is well on its way .
She thanked me and told me that if a friend of mine had a story like mine to tell , she'd fall in love with him .
The king will already have left Southampton .
What's the message from the English king ?
I'll spend tonight working to make something horrible happen .
Thank you for saying that .
They don't want you to go out today .
Good night .
Well , time is the old judge that tries your kind of criminal .
When he loses that , he'll be drinking salt water , since I'll never tell him where the freshwater springs are .
Call him in .
And they respond to you with their hearts as well .
But don't take all that pain on yourself .
Show me , show me .
Farewell .
What is it , Octavia ?
Get going already .
So be it .
You are about as much of a thinker as worm's meat is a nice steak .
My lord , my lord , I don't want to hear any more about it .
Officers , what crime have these men committed ?
Yes , what time is it ?
It was the play in which you wooed the gentlewoman so successfully .
Command this man to leave .
Her husband , you rascal .
Antipholus , aren't you originally from Corinth ?
Only Antony was at fault .
What's Pyramus ?
Ride , ride , Messala .
They're out to get me , and I won't stand for it !
Just give me a moment , please , only a moment .
He does , and now he's taking revenge on you , for breaking promises and for murder , too .
He's married to Octavia .
I would , if I had a mirror .
Mine , too .
The four suitors are looking for you so they can say goodbye , madam .
It's best just to let him go .
What shall I do ?
The morning is approaching .
Let's stay and watch .
I would rather listen to my dog bark at a crow than hear a man swear that he loves me .
Will you be my husband , then ?
You sent me to the port to find a ship .
Wake up the moon goddess with a hymn !
Oh , damn three times , damn ten times the evil man whose wicked deed deprived you of your ingenious mind .
And what irks me more than all these things put together is that he does it under the pretense of love , as though for me to eat or sleep would bring on fatal illness or sudden death .
You don't know whether it was wisdom or fear that made him flee .
Play your flutes !
Heaven help her ! , Get him out of here for now .
I am dying , Cleopatra , dying .
I can only walk a little way with you , since I'm waiting here .
After such a long period of grief , we will have such a celebration !
Why , what have you done , sweet Beatrice ?
You do me wrong by taking me out of the grave .
I'm sure you know him .
What didn't you like ?
How could he have even entertained these thoughts in his heart ?
Why didn't they just kill us that night ?
My granddaughter , with her kind aunt , the duchess of Gloucester , leading her by the hand ?
If they have done this thing , my noble lord , If ?
I put it in the pocket of my nightgown .
Then , in my tent , you can elaborate on your complaints , and I'll listen .
Sir , a word before you go .
Is he here ?
I will .
Let life be short so that shame won't last too long .
I'm old and foolish .
To tell you the truth , they fought the new enemy with twice as much force as before ; they were like cannons loaded with double ammunition .
Thisbe is the lady Pyramus is in love with .
Let him come in .
Are Decius Brutus and Trebonius there ?
Let him command me , and I'll do whatever he asks , no matter how violent .
Thank you .
Is your little pearl in there ?
Lovely Beatrice , I thank you for taking the pains to tell me that .
But these days , people give each other their hands without their hearts .
Come here , Ariel .
How will we pass the time without some entertainment ?
That's where hell is , and darkness , and fires and stench !
The Moor's mind has already become infected with my poisonous suggestions .
You're wise !
I'll write him a taunting letter , and you can deliver it .
Boy !
The queen and her elves will be here soon .
Cheer up as much as you can .
I could do it easily now .
If it's okay with you , you should not press your grievances any further , but realize that the current situation should be enough to reconcile you .
To the breach , to the breach !
There's more to it than that. , Ganymede !
If we're all pork-eaters , we won't be able to get our hands on a slice of bacon , even if we've got the money for it .
That'll be fine .
We achieve things with our intelligence , not by magic , and intelligent planning takes time .
Please rise , Queen .
You were wrong to give away your wife's first gift so thoughtlessly , a thing you swore to keep on your finger and bound faithfully to your body .
Your mother's name has become a threat to her own children .
I'm awkward in my speech and I'm not a smooth talker .
I never offended him at all .
Then they're cold friends to me .
The more I hate him , the more he follows me around .
Though our lives , We have decided , my lord .
This guy has legs like a man but fins for arms !
Fury , Fury ! , Get over there , Tyrant , there .
I was born in Pisa , famous for its serious citizens , like my father before me ; my father , Vincentio , a successful , world-traveled merchant , was one of the
Yes , yes , and let's sing in unison , like two gypsies riding on a single horse .
He got what he deserved .
Do not run away .
Leave us .
Come , sweet nymphs , and help us celebrate the wedding of two true lovers .
Then it must be Banquo's .
Tell me , good Brutus , can you see your face ?
Aren't you dead yet ?
I suggest you lay low until his rage cools a little .
Where are these murderers ?
I'm sorry , sir , but in this war I consider you a subordinate , not my equal .
We'll listen to him .
it pleases you , I'll meet you in the marketplace at five and will keep you company until bedtime .
I'd rather give myself up to the hatred of a violent brother who refuses to recognize that we are brothers .
What did he tell you , Ophelia ?
We're sorry to hear this .
It's nine o'clock !
Cruel , cruel news !
Only if the hearer is a fool or a coward .
I'm out of patience .
He said he was going to buy me a necklace , but I never saw it .
I'm bleeding , but you didn't kill me .
That's the necklace I gave you , sir .
I'll tear it up when it's paid .
He brings great news .
Her bottom .
Hold your peace .
But let it go. , Now , Litio , it's your turn .
You're going to lose this bet , my lord .
If I may say so , your Majesty , as I see it he would be a coward and a villain not to .
If someone like me is fit to be king , let me know .
Where is he ?
No , not sure ones when we're talking about something unsure .
I will , lady .
Oh , I've been murdered unfairly !
Listen to that Petruchio : she says she'll see you hanged first .
Tell me , why did the king arrive with such a small entourage ?
Some good friend of his must have died , because nothing else in the world could change a man so much .
Sir , I leave you to your own contentment .
You , Nick Bottom , have been cast as Pyramus .
What if she won't kiss me ?
You knew my father well ; therefore , you know me , the sole heir to all his property and possessions , which I have added to rather than depleted .
I like to pretend you are , because then it's almost like actually talking to her .
You understand ?
He's evaded love once or twice , and since then Cupid doesn't dare to shoot at him .
Would you care to hear some music ?
I gave you everything , And it was about time too .
First of all , even if all the obstacles were eliminated and my path led straight to the crown , if it were truly my birthright , I would rather hide from my greatness than hide inside the greatness of the position itself and be smothered by it .
Gratiano talks more nonsense than any other man in Venice .
I haven't slept since Cassius first began to turn me against Caesar .
Where is Duncan's body ?
Once again you bring good news .
There are reasons and causes why and how in everything .
I'd better stop up my ears against this siren's song .
No , I'm not wound up .
Come on , let's go see the king .
And now , my friends , my courageous and educated friends , do me one small favor .
Oh , Cassio , Cassio , Cassio !
Who is this bloody man ?
Yes , if Messala recommends me to you .
She could even what ?
Come , let's have an early dinner so that we have time to work out our plans .
The spirit is torturing me .
What hope is that , may I ask ?
That's the only witchcraft I ever used .
Get out of my sight !
Oh , I can buy twenty husbands at any market .
Don't be afraid , even though you see me with a weapon .
I know a terrific wench .
Who are you ?
If so , you'd be buying them to sell again .
I've sent twenty people to look for you .
You don't know me , but I know you're an important person .
Bring me to my host , Macbeth .
You don't need a ghost returning from the grave to tell you that , sir .
My freedom .
Look , here comes Helena .
I've often given money to people who were unable to pay back their loans to him .
He should go up and offer his petition to Caesar now .
My master has instructed me to go to Saint Luke's to tell the priest to be ready in case you should show up with your better half .
Never mind .
There has never been a widow who suffered such loss as me .
I'll prove with my sword that I'm not scared of you .
You're doing the right thing .
Where are you from ?
I hope she keeps it short .
No you haven't , cousin .
Oh , Cassius , Brutus gave the orders too soon .
Does anyone know if Donalbain is with his brother ?
I desperately needed God's blessing , but the word "Amen" stuck in my throat .
I'll make you an example for the others to learn from .
You have a beautiful half-sister , Octavia .
Please say no more .
He's near death , and Roderigo's dead already .
I am not in the giving mood today .
Answer me .
Go pinch your cheeks and bring some color back into your face , you cowardly boy .
What's the matter ?
My lord ?
And so you do .
Is the throne empty ?
What can I say ?
Turn around , you dog from hell , turn around !
God be with you all .
Just as I did with the meat , I'll make up some problem with the way the bed is made , and throw the pillow one way and the cushion the other , and the blanket over here and the sheets over there .
Bleed , bleed , poor country !
Didn't I use to have four or five women taking care of me ?
It's hard to make sense of such different stories .
Pay you ?
I'll be back here with you by two o'clock .
If you think about it correctly , Caesar has suffered a great wrong .
Look at the stars , see how the floor of heaven is inlaid with small disks of bright gold .
You thought about it too long , considering what you found there .
That's five to one .
Look , my cousin is whispering to Claudio that she loves him .
Oh angels , protect us !
Fear will keep you safe .
On my knee , I humbly ask your blessing .
Opportunity's knocking for you , and in my imagination I see a crown dropping onto your head .
You've pretended to be in love with her , singing fake love songs softly at her window by moonlight , and you've captured her imagination by giving her locks of your hair , rings , toys , trinkets , knickknacks , little presents , flowers , and candies , things that can really influence an impressionable young person .
I'm sure I'll feel guilty if I run away from this Jew , my master .
She looks like she's washing her hands .
I'll get it from you , I swear .
Not the Adam from the garden of Eden , but the Adam from the jailhouse .
Please , let's not talk about it .
Mine too , to join hers .
Should I tend your pigs and eat husks with them ?
Here , sir !
I'll stop your mouth with a kiss .
Sir , I'm puzzled by what you just said .
You absolute villain !
When we see that our betters have the same problems we do , we can almost forget our own misery .
Such a wonderful father-in-law and wife make this place a paradise .
Come on .
I'll put the juice of this flower on Titania's eyes , and fill her with horrible delusions and desires .
Let heaven be my witness , I'm putting my mind , my heart , and my hands in Othello's control .
Your grace , please forgive me .
Please , give my regards to your mother , Mrs. Peapod , and your father , Mr. Peapod .
The duke is temperamental .
Why are you so strong and good ?
I ask that none of you leave , except myself , until Antony has finished .
And what is this useless ceremony of kings ?
Let's get out of here !
And what oath do we need other than that we honest men have told each other that this will happen or we will die trying ?
I don't know what to think about this .
We won't go today , or any day until it's clear that it shall be whatever time I say it is .
I've noticed it myself .
Keep me in your thoughts and go comfort your cousin .
Your wife , Fulvia , is dead .
She was fickle and unfaithful , like water .
What , in my presence ?
Shake off your sleepiness .
That's right , she did .
And you , sister ?
I'll take you to where he sleeps , and you can pound a nail into his head .
make your eyes jump out of their sockets , and your hair stand on end like porcupine quills .
There's nothing else .
Can a good thing hide itself ?
Go now , Lord Constable and all you princes , and quickly bring us news of England's defeat .
Have them click their heels together and don't dare touch a hair of the master's horse's tail till they kiss their hands .
Contagious infection of humanity , give me a chance to condemn you for the evils I know you've committed .
I wish I could live longer .
Benedick , did you notice Signior Leonato's daughter ?
She's cheating on me ?
And what's your connection with the traitors who landed in our kingdom recently ?
I say "force" because Brutus would rather I stuck sharp blades and poisoned arrows in his ears than fill them with this .
Why are you treating my sister like this ?
You're not thinking of leaving tonight , surely ?
Oh , my mistress , a villain has made a mockery of your love !
Oh Banquo , Banquo , the king has been murdered !
You know what they say .
I'll never see it .
Tomorrow , sir , I'm fighting for my reputation , and any man who gets away without a broken bone or two is an exceptional wrestler indeed .
Messala !
But I would rather abstain from everything for four days than drink so much in one .
It should work .
Good lord !
In exchange , give up your claim to love Helena , since I love her and will love her until I die .
But despite all this , your daughters will give you a lot of money , or do I mean pain ? , in the coming year .
And I have much less to comfort me than you do , since I've lost my daughter .
I'll have Herod's head chopped off !
Are these our eyes ?
That's not good .
She's too much for me to handle .
It's a trick to confuse us .
Who's in there ?
You stupid fool !
But don't do that .
But where is Kate ?
So you'll bring the necklace to her yourself ?
Don't bother us up here .
You !
Now Margaret's curse has fallen on our heads , for standing by and doing nothing when Richard stabbed her son .
Me too .
And if your love can produce something from its sadness , write a poem for her ; hang it on her grave and sing it to her bones .
I have to go to England , don't you know that ?
Well , all right then .
Oh , what a villain I am !
Do you have your answer yet ?
Not true .
You have the power to fix it .
I'm not sleepy at all .
We'll draw straws .
Signor Lodovico ?
Well , then it will be dry .
He's married , madam .
It was tossed into the window of my room .
Pay me three times the amount of the loan and let the Christian go .
I'm not really Litio .
When such a great man dies there should be a thunderclap .
I go , Caesar .
And I'll turn you into a spirit like us , so you won't die as humans do. , Come here , Peaseblossom , Cobweb , Moth , and Mustardseed !
May I only do well in these dangerous battles if my intention to repent and prosper is sincere !
Don't be afraid .
So I can sleep away the time while my Antony is gone .
Play some music while he chooses .
What's new with you ?
What did he do to you ?
Yes , it's me .
They commanded me to lock my doors and leave you out in this merciless storm , but I've come out here to find you and take you where there's warmth and food .
Oh heaven , oh earth , witness what I'm about to say , and reward me if I tell the truth !
My royal lord , you're not entertaining the guests .
My lord , the mayor of London is here to greet you .
But since this has happened , you should fix it for your own good .
I'll go to the hole to see if I can hear my Thisbe's face .
Young boys and girls are equal to men .
So , if they die unprepared , the king is no more guilty of their damnation than he was guilty of the earlier crimes they're finally being punished for .
What are you doing here in Elsinore ?
With those plays in mind , we hope you'll receive this one kindly .
No , sir .
Oh , that's disgusting !
I took good care of you , piece of filth that you are , and let you stay in my own hut until you tried to rape my daughter .
But here's a paper with Caesar's seal on it .
But now they rise from the dead with twenty fatal head wounds and push us off our stools .
Do you love me ?
When you free your children from the sword , your grandchildren will repay you in your old age .
All these friends are my witnesses , so I swear to you , I swear by your beautiful eyes , in which I see myself reflected , Did you hear that !
Who talks of my nation ?
Now my friend Petruchio will help me out , presenting me to old Baptista as a schoolmaster for Bianca well-versed in music .
He's too argumentative for me .
I love you so much that I'll send your soul to heaven very soon , if heaven will accept anything from me , that is .
You can see how it is all around .
Sa , sa , sa , sa .
Didn't I deserve anything more than a fool's head ?
Why ?
What's wrong with you ?
Good old lord Gonzalo , " as you call him , is saddest of all , with tears running down his beard .
It's a nice hazy feeling , so give in to it .
Yes , it's true .
So be quiet .
Why have you collapsed ?
What is your name ?
Nym , what you say is true .
She's dead to me .
Right away , Caesar .
Caesar greets the Queen of Egypt and asks that you consider what you will ask from him .
It's good you hunted for yourself , sir .
Forever and forever , farewell , Brutus !
Good morning , my noble lord .
I'm hoping my holy mood will pass .
It's the smartest partition I've ever heard speak , my lord .
Even if he were as important a man as the devil , as Lucifer or Beelzebub himself , he's required , see , your Grace , to keep his vow .
He should swear by his two-faced self , and that's an oath I'll believe !
Oh , it's dreadful , dreadful , Iago !
But soon I'll see the gods punish you for your lack of respect to your father .
Follow her .
To this day , the kings of France follow this unspoken rule , even though they point to this Salic law to bar your Highness from inheriting it through the female line .
Even if these men have escaped the law and punishment at home , they can not escape God .
As a wandering lunatic , he can do whatever he wants .
It'll be worth your while .
I have no opinion about him .
Don't say that , Lysander .
Shall we not ?
I love you with so much of my heart that none of it is left to protest with .
As long as hell and Richard want it .
Oh , Bottom , you've changed !
He'll find out soon what happened in England .
No , dear Queen .
He's very bright .
What are you going to do for her ?
What's your name ?
You rudely snuck out of bed .
Lucentio , sir .
I can't get that song out of my head tonight .
He thinks he's still playing his instrument .
Here , take my sword .
Then leave him out .
Give me the goblets .
And I came with him .
Don't bring me any more reports .
What a tunneler !
But Lysander's so attractive that he's turned heaven into hell !
I still insisted on knowing what the matter was , but you wouldn't answer me , instead giving me an angry wave of your hand and telling me to leave you alone .
I think I hear them .
Don't ask why .
No , the whole day , and all night too .
When I was still living with him I heard him swear to Tubal and Cush , his countrymen , that he'd rather have Antonio's flesh than twenty times the sum Antonio owed .
There aren't three people in all of Egypt who could do better .
I'd rather die .
I'll stand guard with you tonight .
I'll reward you once for your cheerfulness and ten times for your courage .
I'll see them safely married first and then hurry back to my master's .
Did you see anything ?
Why should people like me be crawling around between earth and heaven ?
I will live in your heart , die in your lap , and be buried in your eyes , and , what's more , I will go with you to your uncle's .
I did .
Didn't you know ?
The sight of them is offensive .
Then one of you will warp and pull away , and there goes your marriage .
Any news from Genoa ?
My old bones are tired .
Are you going to watch the race ?
Please get him , my friend , I beg you .
The services I have done for the Venetian government will count for more than his complaints will .
You go and talk to the duke so he won't notice I'm helping the king .
I'll get it done right away .
I'll have none of your money .
Give me some applause , if we're friends , and Robin will make everything up to you .
I know he holds me dear , but I haven't asked him about the coronation , and he hasn't told me .
Be silent , or else my magic spell will be broken .
How do you both plead ?
Where are you from ?
You who are beautiful beyond words , calm down and let me explain myself .
I don't think so !
God have mercy on us !
Whatever I say , or think , or do , you're continually contradicting it .
To see an elderly , unlucky merchant from Syracuse publicly beheaded for breaking the law and coming here to Ephesus .
Yes , my lord ?
The Emperor is calling for Canidius .
Please , sir , don't trouble yourself .
We're searching on land , but he's lost in the sea .
All right , I'll stop .
I assure you he can .
That's not good , and no good can come of it either .
Let me speak my mind , and I'll rid the world of its sickness , if it will only tolerate my medicine .
It may be so .
Sir , I tell you that we are not .
If you can prove that I'll ever be so in love that I can't be brought to my senses with a good round of beers , you can pluck out my eyes with a love-poet's pen and hang me on a brothel's door where the picture of blind Cupid usually goes .
My lord , he will swear on his life that I haven't kept a thing. , Tell the truth , Seleucus .
Oh Cassio , Cassio , Cassio !
What do you think of his neighbor , the Scottish lord ?
Gentlemen , please try to sharpen his interest even more , and let this play do him some good .
Check on your daughter , your house , your money !
Go with my brothers to my English peers .
Oh , killing that child was the dirtiest , most merciless deed there ever was !
Halt !
Now he'll work himself up to a fury .
That's me .
That's the way of the world .
Please don't play games .
You and your servant are very funny , sir .
I'll smear my face with filth , put on a loincloth , make my hair matted and tangled , and face the bad weather wearing almost nothing .
It's fair for him to treat me like this , very fair .
God forbid he wants to challenge me !
Small but brave in his surroundings , he's trying to stand up against the wind and rain blowing back and forth .
Then tomorrow we'll find that they feel only like eating , not like fighting .
Caesar loses supporters wherever he raises money .
But if it is a sin to be selfish about honor , I am the most guilty soul alive .
I ask too much of you , but you're always willing .
Let us prepare for our wedding. , On that day , I'll take your oath of loyalty , my Lord of Burgundy and all my peers , to guarantee my treaty .
But I have a legitimate son a few years older than this one , and I don't love him any more than I love my bastard .
I've told you I'm your friend , and I'll stick by you .
Though that must have been a pitiful sight , the ground looked beautiful .
We already knew that .
If you don't mind , I need to rest a bit .
Who's there ?
Do it now .
Come down , brother .
This is a nasty night to go swimming .
Isn't there a guard around ?
You don't have a man's courage .
Do you agree that Ferdinand must have drowned ?
They're murdering Caesar ! " Who's there ?
I want the law , the penalty , and the fulfillment of my contract .
Actually , an old religious uncle of mine taught me how to speak , and he was brought up in the city .
I'll wait on them with all respect and duty .
Yes , as much as you look like yourself .
He rode that prologue like a wild horse .
And in her eyes I see a fire that would seem to burn away the lies the princes have told about her chastity .
Toward Chertsey , noble lord ?
Ah , don't tear yourself away from me !
Show me the caskets and let me try my luck .
Yes , now I'm in Arden , and that makes me the bigger fool .
Did you see that ?
There is laughter in heaven When earthly affairs are put right And people unite .
I'm begging you , take the cork out of your mouth so I can drink the news .
The nobles of Cyprus whom you invited to dinner are waiting for you .
That's the deal .
He's right over there .
But who's coming ?
Richmond is sailing on the sea .
Be there , or don't show your face again .
And whoever lives to see that day Will walk with his feet .
Where's the necklace ?
I'd be ashamed to give you this .
But constant expression of wild grief will only make it tame , so I'm not going to say any more about my boys until I've gouged your eyes out with my bare hands .
Me , ma'am ?
So that's what I'll do , not because I love her but because I'll get something out of it .
I can't go any further , sir .
Right now , my pressing business calls me away .
Next he slung his arm around the bride's neck and kissed her with such a smack that when they parted the sound of their lips made the whole church echo .
Men's faces are truthful , whatever their hands do .
I hope this play is well cast now .
I'm going to ask her to let me talk to Desdemona .
Some of this liquor's still left in the goblet .
He only lived long enough to become a man , and as soon as he proved that he was a man by fighting like one , he died .
Let's go back to our bedroom .
No problem , madam .
Ah , revenge !
Where are my slippers ?
Here's another jacket to say thanks .
You'll be lord of the island then , and I'll be your servant .
You never heard of the Centaur ?
Hey !
Antonio , as I heard in Genoa , What , what , what ?
Hopefully , your wedding day is only postponed .
For that kind of relief , the patient must heal herself .
Caesar , what did my stay in Egypt have to do with you ?
I'll straighten it , then play , Where's the Queen ?
How is it that you've come back so soon ?
The wind is right and it's high tide , and I've delayed him a long time already .
I do the wrong and am the first to start quarrels .
I'll stand , and so will Trinculo .
I beg you , daughter , don't make me crazy .
He doesn't have to care .
Then we can let this ambitious tyrant continue unchallenged until each of us is killed at his whim .
But she must be , Friar .
Listen , listen to what I say : whoever strikes first , I'll run him through with my sword , as sure as I'm a soldier .
Who's shouting ?
That's very strange .
No , he didn't get any by me .
Welcome , my good Alexas .
Let George Stanley die after the battle .
He had one yesterday .
If I know nothing about pity , that must mean I'm not an animal .
And how did she react to all this ?
He's a good soldier too , lady .
They'll tell all .
Because , if you must know , she's been chosen by Signior Gremio .
I'm even happier that I'm not stupid , and I can learn .
Who's his lieutenant , do you know ?
The food inside is warm , but you're out here freezing .
You'd better shut up !
What did that gentile fool say to you , hmmm ?
If not , goodbye .
Your English sorrows will make me smile in France .
You are a rude , ragged nurse and an old , sullen playmate for such tender princes .
You dance and prance and lisp ; you call God's creations by pet names , and you excuse your sexpot ploys by pleading ignorance .
You're lying .
He's done wrong , and his master the king will punish him for it .
Who wouldn't get sad thinking about things like that ?
Don't delay , Caesar .
I'll beat him until the welts look like basket-weave !
I wish I had !
Were you born here ?
Farewell .
For God's sake , send somebody else .
There were enough Christians before , as many of them as could stand to live near each other .
I'll think of something .
Oh , Regan , Goneril , your kind old father whose generous heart gave you everything , Oh , if I think about that I'll go mad .
Grant their law-abiding request !
I am an ass , indeed : you can tell by my long ears .
Write all this
No , it's permanent .
They killed your wife , your children , your servants , anyone they could find .
I mean a husband .
Cowards die many times before their deaths .
Tell me , how is my mother ?
Oh yes , sir , I have often been to Pisa , Pisa , City of Wise Men .
Here we'll shake hands good-bye .
Refusing to fight him at sea won't disgrace you .
You have to pretend to be your niece's father , and give her away to Claudio .
Yes , I'm sure he's dead .
Yes , and a brave one , who dares to look at something that would frighten the devil .
And everyone can say "welcome , " which is just a word .
I want you .
Go , but sign the deed .
Who is to blame for this : Antony or I ?
Think like this all day , and you'll learn how to curse .
What a lying , drunken monster .
Good gentlemen , look like you're rested and happy .
So order the armies to rest , and let's go home to share the glories of this happy day .
Such a kind father ! , Are my horses ready ?
And it's all your fault .
God bless you for doing this .
Valentine's Day is over .
Her name is Portia .
Please listen to me carefully .
No , not at all .
How can I describe you that will make you appeal to the young woman and will also agree with God , the law , my honor , and her feelings ?
I have a daughter .
It was just two days ago that I tripped you and beat you up in front of the king .
To race after your departing ships , leaving his navy to watch , was a shame as great as the resulting loss .
man's cheeks .
Do you believe his "offers , " as you call them ?
Since I was so drawn to studying things like logic , grammar , geometry , and astronomy , I let my control of the government slide a bit , being too wrapped up in my occult books .
She's Phoebe-ing me .
No flattery for him , no sir !
But stop , I say .
Oh , really ?
My mistress here lies murdered in her bed , No , heaven forbid !
And you won't tell me who you are ?
Did he tell Macduff to return to Scotland ?
I need to get away from you .
His coffers are too poor to atone for our losses , his entire kingdom too small to account for the amount of blood we've shed , and the sight of him kneeling at our feet an empty satisfaction compared to the indignity we have put up with .
If you have me , you have me now at my worst ; and if you have me , you'll appreciate me better and better .
She has a body , not a life .
How am I evil to advise Cassio to do exactly what'll do him good ?
He taught me how to recognize a man in love , and you're not a prisoner of love , I'm sure .
Since you are a lying hypocrite , we must look after you .
Will you listen to me , Roderigo ?
If you care about your health , you won't push me any further .
To that end , I presented him with the tennis balls , the perfect expression of his inexperience and frivolity .
You did .
Not if the minor ones come up first .
Well , if a moist palm isn't a clear sign of promiscuity , then I can't scratch my own ear .
Why not ?
Yes , sir .
I hope with all my heart she will !
God bless the island of Cyprus and our noble general Othello !
Go , get out !
If knives , poison , or snakes have edge , effect , or venom , I am safe from that fate .
There's no other shelter around here .
We are your servants , your highness , and as always our house and everything in it is at your disposal , for after all , we keep it in your trust and we're glad to give you back what's yours .
You tell her , widow !
With Cassio ?
This guy doesn't pay much attention to punctuation .
You're not supposed to get old until you're wise .
Then see a good one for me .
I hope not , Madam .
I don't like what you're asking me to do .
I'll bandy you about and overwhelm you with my cleverness .
None of us .
I knew Temperance , she was a fine girl .
If he becomes pale , I know what to do .
Why do you need even one ?
I have to stay with the servants , who are with our camp's luggage .
Do you want to sink ?
Here comes a messenger .
This disease is beyond my medical skills .
You're naughty .
Caesar and Lepidus are organizing their military operation .
No , I didn't , but I did every night for the past year .
Where's Peaseblossom ?
I wish it were day !
She's a virtuous and holy lady .
A guy like that is bigger than an ape , but the ape could be his doctor , it's so much smarter .
Who asked you to call her ?
I'm sorry , my friend .
A man's virtues will always show themselves , and that's the end of that .
If you aren't immortal , watch those around you .
Instead of Celia , call me Aliena .
Put a candle in my study , Lucius .
That's what he said .
If you have a voice or can make sounds , speak to me .
I mean what I say .
So we are in agreement .
You are their heir and sit on their throne , and the blood and courage that glorified them run in your veins .
No , my good lord .
Just the weathervane moving .
What bond do we need other than that of discreet Romans who have said what they're going to do and won't back down ?
Fortune is happy today and , in this mood , will give us anything we want .
Be calm , dear lady .
Cleopatra , Do you think there ever was , or could there ever be , a man such as the one I dreamed about ?
Speak confidently .
Then it's certain they're heading for Cyprus .
What is it , Laertes ?
I know that , sir .
What do you mean , do I think so ?
Hey , Grumio !
How are you doing ?
But taste my story , and relish it by paying attention .
You should always be honest .
With that , I hope God is with him !
Yes , please tell me .
If you're not having sex with Desdemona tomorrow night , then I suggest you find some way to stab me in the back and kill me .
I accept with thanks , Enobarbus .
Drink up .
But my eyes , which I've darted at you , haven't even left a mark .
He says your daughter's not feeling well , my lord .
Sometimes the expression on her face tells me she likes me .
I say it's the moon that shines so bright .
But I know why a snail carries its house on its back .
Oh , correct it completely .
Look , here it is .
But suppose I did all the things you named out of love for her .
I guess this is not a fish , but a native who got struck by lightning just now .
Don't you care about me ?
If I were Brutus now and Brutus were me , I wouldn't have let him influence me .
Please leave it to me to take care of the burial , as I have more reason to mourn than you do .
Claim fair England's peace depends on this alliance .
Prepare the horses for your lady .
We all begged you not to go ahead with those marriage plans , and your lovely daughter struggled between disgust at marrying an African and the desire to obey you .
My songbird , we have beaten them to their beds .
While he and I are at one , my loyal servant Catesby will be at the other , so nothing will happen that we won't find out about .
It sounds more like you're insulting me .
If we're like you in everything else , we'll resemble you in that respect .
Do your best .
So come with me .
Gloucester's eyes ?
He couldn't be a lion if the Romans weren't such easy prey .
Were you mad when you spoke to me so madly ?
You wrong me , Brutus .
Soldiers , sir .
My father's studying hard , so he won't see you .
I said she was .
What do you think you're doing ?
Fever , as we know , is a kind of madness .
From the earth , or the air ?
My Lord of Norfolk , Here , most gracious king .
There's another .
In that case , I don't much care for you either .
Hello , sir .
Oh , it's as easy as lying .
Bad deeds will be revealed , no matter how people try to hide them .
Do you really mean to go after this wildcat ?
They eat us up hungrily , and when they're full , they vomit us up .
I sent you a letter while you were carousing in Alexandria .
He's fainted !
I am a villain .
Why are we talking about him like this ?
You weren't good enough for her .
We shall , my liege .
I'm just stating the facts as I see them .
Oh , what a long , tedious , exhausting night !
Someone else has the same name , but he's a better man .
So-so" is good , very good , an excellent answer .
Your brothers ?
If I'm killed , it will only be the death of a man who was willing to be dead .
Don't speak of this again .
Keep an eye on him .
On the condition that your sister's son , Publius , also must die , Mark Antony .
Which of you does not tremble when you see me ?
Aren't they at this very moment on the western shore helping the rebels land safely from their ships ?
Oh , Corin , I wish you could understand how much I love her !
Go !
Yes , thoroughly .
He has captured Toryne .
I'm at your service .
I wish I could repay this happy news with good news of my own .
Quiet !
Well , the difference of a horse !
Every second you delay is as long and dull as a journey to South Seas .
Thank you .
Not tonight , Iago .
My spells are working well , my spirits are obeying me , and everything is right on schedule .
Let it stay in your inventory until it bankrupts you .
No , keep flattery for kissing the hands of those who can pay well .
Is it four o'clock ?
Swaggering ?
There's no bravery in an unfair fight .
Oh , uncle , it's better to smile and flatter indoors where it's dry than get soaked out here .
He'll tell them so .
None , my lord .
Has anyone ever courted a woman in this state of mind ?
It must be a spirit .
You're Lear's shadow .
We would profane the other dead souls here if we sang the same requiem for her that we sang for them .
Lock him in , so he can play the fool in his own home only .
What a wise judge !
What is logical , then , my lord ?
I dreamed about an emperor called Antony .
Come on , be a man .
You can hope your father isn't your real father .
Look out , he's coming !
Speak , man , what's the matter ?
Now , tailor , let's see what you've got .
Cassio's killed a young Venetian named Roderigo .
Tranio , I saw her coral-pink lips move and perfume the air with her breath .
Did you mention that Edward's children are bastards ?
If we leave , it will feel like nothing less than death to them .
Tomorrow's a good day .
When we're in love , we don't see with our eyes but with our minds .
We don't think so , my lord .
I don't think so .
In fact , she's crazed .
He and Lepidus are at Caesar's house .
Now , I'll begin : first , we came down a steep hill , my master riding behind my mistress , Both on one horse ?
Better men than you have heard me speak my mind , and if you can't take it , then you'd better plug your ears .
On top of this , they've either burned or carried away everything that was in the king's tent .
What ?
Yes , we will .
Whenever you want , since you're the one who wants it .
You know where she is .
Are those my tents on fire ?
I need people as trustworthy as you .
To save her life , I'll say she doesn't .
You haven't seen him since ?
Welcome , my friends .
How long will a man lie in his grave before he starts to rot ?
No .
The enemy is making its appearance on the battlefield .
I regret all the boring time I wasted with her .
If you refuse it , the whole country will regret it .
I know you'd never skip school .
Have you written that down , that they aren't criminals ?
Check the calendar and come tell me .
Shut up .
No , I don't , my lord .
I've rented land from you and your father for eighty years .
I think I hear the drums far away .
But tell me , are you speaking seriously ?
I tell you , Charles , he's the stubbornest young fellow in France : overly ambitious , jealous of other people's good qualities , and a traitor against me , his own blood brother .
They saw him just now as mad and deranged as the stormy sea , singing loudly , wearing a crown of nettles , thorns , hemlock , and all the other weeds that grow in our cornfields. , Send out a hundred soldiers to find him .
If he's never drunk it before , it'll help soothe his fever .
Often I have heard of "sanctuary men , " but until now I've never heard of "sanctuary children." My lord , you've won me over this time .
I think they do .
You'll see that Caesar is giving you no reason to do so .
Is this your good friend who's in so much trouble ?
The Turkish navy will be broken up .
Oh , Antony !
Here , you goddamn incest-breeding Danish murderer , drink this .
And I was right , because where's your husband now ?
Well , then , you don't have the affection that would teach you that you and I are one .
Oh , good old man , you're a great example of that old work ethic , where people worked because it was their duty , not just for the money .
Only until noon , my lord ?
What do you mean , your highness ?
For God's sake , let me hear it .
Come , come , let's remember why we're here .
I'm not a doddering old fool who brags about the things he did when he was young , and what he would do now if he weren't so old .
As long as it's honorable , you can be sure that I'll let you use all my money and do everything I can to help you .
Are you down in the dumps ?
He was in a good mood , and then suddenly he started thinking of Rome .
You are my guests .
I won't be a soldier anymore .
The clock says it's daytime , but dark night is strangling the sun .
I do think Scotland is sinking under Macbeth's oppression .
Who will advance with me ?
That's what's clever about it .
Watch me like a hawk .
A tailor made you .
I learned to do this from you .
My soul will keep yours company on the way to heaven .
You may have lost his respect , but so have I .
I hope that's all he loses .
You're giving him a present ?
How will you wreck this marriage ?
Evil can come from good , just as poisonous snakes tend to come out into the open on bright sunny days , which means we have to walk carefully .
I appreciate your frankness and your brevity .
He speaks well .
You see how the world goes , Volumnius .
You're a hardworking villain who'd do anything his evil mistress wanted him to .
In my travels , great scholars have come up to me , meaning to greet me with well-rehearsed welcoming speeches , and I have seen them tremble and turn pale , and pause inappropriately in the middle of their sentences , and botch their well-rehearsed tones of voice because they're so nervous , and then break off abruptly at the end , without actually welcoming me .
What's the matter here , gentlemen ? , Honest Iago , you look upset .
If you can't answer it , Go ahead !
He's late .
Oh my Christian ducats !
What do you think , Bottom ?
It's difficult to have such immaturity so close to my heart , but bear with me .
Clarence is still alive ; Edward is not only alive , he's king .
That is , if we ever want to return to being rivals for Bianca's love .
Yes , sir , very well , I'm here in your orchard .
Men may sleep , and when they do they may have their throats with them , and some people say knives have blades .
My lord ?
Please , uncle , let's go in and ask your daughters to forgive you .
Do you recognize the handwriting ?
What did you mean by not helping me ?
He could never bear carnation .
Listen to me , because I'm older than you , surely .
Those are only two of his weapons .
He has a father , and yet he is fatherless .
I'm well , and probably will be for a while , as I hear that four feasts are being prepared .
What's this part for ?
She provoked me with her lying mouth , accusing me of crimes I didn't commit .
I'm indebted to you forever .
I guess you don't want it .
To Dover .
I was an idiot to take it !
There isn't enough leek left for you to swear on .
That part is up to you .
If I'm lying , then
That is exactly why we wanted you here , your lordship , to avoid the public carping and complaints .
I'm not a slut , I keep myself clean , but I thank God I am ugly .
He won't see my face ever again .
So don't spend one night away from this house .
As
But aren't there some healthy men whom we have to make sick ?
I've practiced Stoicism with as much devotion as you , but I still couldn't bear this news like you do .
Great Duke , be merciful to mortal men .
I would rip his heart out in public and eat it .
I'll put it on anyway .
On the platform where we stand guard , sir .
I knew your father .
I can only do it by lying , my lord , but I can do it so secretly that no one will suspect me .
Now tell me how long you intend to keep her .
I'm game .
Lazy people end up at the bottom , and you deserve to be at the top .
That was good planning , and you'll sleep some more .
My master is being difficult .
Follow me .
Let's proceed .
I've spent most of my money , and tonight I got beaten up .
It's easy to get Desdemona on your side .
What do you think about it ?
Those cowardly , gigantic sides of beef have been responsible for many of your family members getting eaten as a condiment on beef .
There , take it , and thanks for taking such good care of me .
Cobweb .
I'm telling you , Aliena , I can't stand being apart from Orlando .
I'm ready and waiting. , Give me your hand , Bassanio .
Now , let it work .
Where's that dog ?
Hurry up .
Let them go .
Well , other men have bad luck too .
Tell me , Captain Macmorris , have you left the tunnels ?
If there is , then heaven help him !
Leave her to God and her own guilt .
Goodbye .
It's almost morning , but I'm sure you're not fully satisfied about what happened .
I'm seizing your lands and all that you possess until your brother gives testimony that absolves you of any guilt .
Oh , you mighty gods !
You're a good judge of horsemanship .
Your son will have my consent to marry my daughter .
But don't keep wondering without more proof .
Is this face Hero's ?
I swear on my life and honor , he'll sit here in the stocks until noon .
In ten days time , if you're found within twenty miles of the court , you'll die for it .
We've all come out to see what will happen. , Go , Hercules !
I always pray for them
I'll go see my mother soon .
Tell me .
Hurry , send someone immediately !
They will tell me more , because I'm determined to know the worst about what's going to happen .
I'm making a kind offer , zero percent financing .
If you got what you deserved , you would learn some respect .
Damn your wine !
Worthy sir , greetings !
No , who are you talking about ?
We thought you ought to know about it .
In a half an hour he'll be asleep .
Get up , I tell you !
If not , you can kill me .
Or thorn-bushes .
When I have the juice of that flower , I'll trickle some drops of it on Titania's eyes while she's sleeping .
Master , if you eat with her , bring really long silverware .
By watching their show , you'll find out everything you're likely to know .
Goneril , you know how much I love you , but still I have to say , Shush , please .
With that I kiss your hand and call you my queen .
The foulest fate would be most appropriate for me now in this latest phase of my life .
His horse is better than the Neapolitan's and he frowns more than the Count Palatine .
Hortensio
Oh , dainty duck !
Let's take up the best positions we can in the valleys .
You wronged yourself to write on behalf of such a man .
Do you want to know who they are , then ?
What do you mean , get rid of him ?
Let's go inside and we'll answer all your questions truthfully .
The only thing I could do with her is to use all that oil as fuel in a lamp and then use that light to run away by .
I can't believe my sister would neglect her obligations in any way .
Let me know .
He will live as a cursed man .
Don't worry about me .
Here they come .
Think about our situation , then die .
And you called the fairy creature harmless , monster .
What do you think of marching to Philippi immediately ?
Will it ?
Isn't there one man left in the world who knows not to take a wife ?
That's the next thing on the agenda .
I'll cry at nothing , and I'll always do it when you're in a good mood .
Messala , I have received these letters explaining that young Octavius and Mark Antony are rushing toward Philippi and bearing down upon us with a mighty power .
He's a good fellow , I can tell you that much .
Watch out , boy , remember I can whip you .
Call in the messengers and we'll find out .
With God as my witness , I swear I have wept for yours .
Here's the water , right ?
Did he treat you well when you saw him ?
Please , don't take it badly , but I can not and will not give in to you .
Caesar !
Ever since these deadly conflicts erupted between your violent countrymen and ours , both you Syracusians and we Ephesians have held serious councils and decided not to permit any travel between our two hostile towns .
This is getting worse and worse !
The wildest animal isn't as cruel as you are .
You've pierced me through the heart with your cruelty , and yet you , the murderer , look as bright and clear as a star in the sky .
Didn't you call him a liar ?
Farewell to you both .
I'll take comfort in my books and music , reading and practicing my instruments .
Beware of jealousy , my lord !
Do you know any , count ?
But listen to me , Gratiano .
I won't stay behind .
God help Claudio !
Imagine , me , a drunk !
I have no doubt he got ashore alive .
Be eloquent on my behalf .
Lock the door .
I'll be there early .
Until then , God be with you !
Here comes Lorenzo .
By the moon and stars !
Be careful not to fall in .
Let's send this news to Rome .
Please , who ?
When the day comes , I'll wish it were nighttime , so I could sleep with the legal expert's clerk .
It will heal and be as good as new , and we'll be threatened by its fangs once again .
You armor my heart .
But how will we keep it from being passed now , my lord ?
I'm your little dog , Demetrius .
Who would choose to grunt and sweat through an exhausting life , unless they were afraid of something dreadful after death , the undiscovered country from which no visitor returns , which we wonder about without getting any answers from and which makes us stick to the evils we know rather than rush off to seek the ones we don't ?
Be patient until I finish .
See how well she can turn ?
Go and get our stuff onto the ship .
Who should begin ?
I don't even have one to throw at a dog .
That's true , lieutenant .
First , I ask you what they've done ; thirdly , I ask you what offense they're charged with ; sixth and lastly , I ask you why they've been committed here ; and , in conclusion , I ask what they're accused of .
Shame on you , warped hag !
I think Belman is just as good , my lord .
My lord , you used to like me .
Don't come near till you hear me call you .
Please go find out for certain who has arrived .
Not long ago you challenged and opposed your brother , and it is only very recently that he has forgiven you .
Go on , tell it .
My master's a total Jew .
In these less dainty times , you're not breaking the laws of sanctuary to seize him .
We have slashed the snake but not killed it .
I wish I could keep killing him for nine years straight .
My lord , here is the entrance .
What have I ever done that he has anything to complain about ?
But who was that man ?
I will go straight to visit him .
Well , sir , and you , witty lady , who gave me quite a turn with your strange talk , my name is Vincentio , my hometown Pisa , and I am traveling to Padua to visit a son of mine whom I haven't seen in a long while .
You'll know about that later .
He wants to eat the English .
If wolves had been howling outside your gate at the heart of that storm , you would've told your doorman to let them in , despite all the cruelties you inflict on the world .
How many people who are humble now would be great then ?
I'm a nobleman , and I know what I'm doing in assigning this job to you .
Goodbye .
Get yourself to a convent , fast .
The will !
Nothing that I know for sure , but a lot that I'm afraid might happen .
I'll reward treason with blows , I promise you .
Another case : King Lewis the Tenth , who was sole heir to the usurper Capet , could not rest easy as king until he was assured that Queen Isabel , his grandmother , was a direct descendent of the Lady Ermengare , daughter of the aforementioned Charles duke of Lorraine , by which marriage the line of Charles the Great was reunited with the throne of France .
I'm coming , my lord .
Let me talk , good lady .
Alas , you misunderstood everything !
Most noble Caesar !
That's not good .
I know the sound of his walk. , Die , villain !
Judge for yourself .
What ?
All three of us will marry now in death .
I'm sure everything will be fine .
Come on , you keep getting paler .
I'll agree to those terms and even say that Jews are nice .
She has a low-pitched voice .
At least it's possible in Denmark .
It's certain .
If you don't repay me on the day we agree on , in the place we name , for the sum of money fixed in our contract , your penalty will be a pound of your pretty flesh , to be cut off and taken out of whatever part of your body I like .
As for the Jew's contract , don't let it be a factor in your plans .
Get out of here , before his bad luck infects you too .
No , I swear it .
Now I want her more than ever .
I'm reminding your grace what you promised me .
Take him safely through the lines .
If his face changed as much as his personality has , I wouldn't recognize him .
They will , Nerissa , but we'll be disguised as men .
Everyone except the sailors dove into the sea , leaving behind the ship that I had set on fire .
Too bad it's spoiling our pleasure tonight .
Is that possible ?
The whole town will riot !
You won't lose any respect .
Doesn't a Jew eat the same food , get hurt with the same weapons , get sick with the same diseases , get healed by the same medicine , and warm up in summer and cool off in winter just like a Christian ?
I can't find anyone who saw her leave .
I wouldn't want a heart like hers even if you made me queen .
The hell with order !
Okay , just stay quiet .
The note is a big fat liar if it says I said so .
You couldn't beat the two of them apart .
She was utterly true to you !
Ha !
Fight it like a man .
Oh Buckingham , now I'm going to test to see if you're truly made of gold .
As soon as you kill Prospero .
I can't sleep quietly in the Tower .
I've never seen him like this .
Why , what are you afraid of ?
Good night , Lord Brutus .
This story breaks my heart .
And yet she cheapens herself by turning her gaze on me , who cut her sweet prince's life short and made her a widow ?
You'd better not wear your dagger in your cap that day , or he might slap your head with it .
Listen !
Just as you got Milan , I'll get Naples .
Has it been decided that Richard will be It's been decided , though not yet officially announced .
Take this mad wretch to jail. , Father-in-law Baptista , will you see that he's available to appear in court ?
Everything's fine now .
But I will tell you that lately the duke has been displeased with his niece , and for no other reason than that people praise her virtues and pity her for her father's sake .
Where is the king ?
I do too , my lord .
Huntsman , look after my hounds .
When I freed you from slavery , didn't you swear to do this when I asked you ?
You're in a hurry , are you ?
But I'll go in .
Seyton ! , I'm sick at heart when I see , Seyton , come here ! , This battle will either secure my reign forever or else topple me from the throne .
No , you monstrous hags , I'll get revenge on you both that will make the whole world, I will do such things , I don't know what I'll do exactly , but it'll be devastating .
Oh , Ophelia , I'm bad at poetry .
Yes , my good lord .
You saw eternity in my lips and eyes , and happiness in the arch of my eyebrows .
You could have come sooner .
This fake astonishment of yours is just like your other pranks .
Suffer love !
I'm surprised I didn't bite back .
Has anyone offended your Worship ?
Why do you spit at me ?
If the world were mine , I'd give it all up , everything except Demetrius , to be you .
Our guiding light is out .
See you soon .
Young man , have you challenged Charles the Wrestler ?
Why is Time so cheap about giving out hair ?
Very near , and approaching fast .
What are you fighting about ?
Romans , countrymen , and friends !
You're a traveler .
I'll pay you for your trouble .
We have to think about that .
God knows I waited for you in anguish , pain , and agony when I gave birth to you .
Ran off with a Christian !
Mantua .
God help me !
Where was she born ?
I have been sent on ahead to light a fire , and they are coming after to warm themselves .
Your lives are over .
That's good , if he'll really do it .
That big ship over there looks no bigger
They intend to challenge us here at Philippi , responding to our challenge before we've even challenged him .
You should say , "I sort of know him , but not well .
What , would you have me beg for my food ?
That's right .
The men there won't give a penny to a lame beggar , but they'll pay ten cents to look at a freak show exhibit .
But you must not attract iron , because my heart is as true as steel .
You're torturing me , Tubal .
I met Venus as she was with her son on her way to her home on Paphos , in a carriage pulled by doves .
Don't do it with poison .
As for your husband , he is noble , wise , and judicious , and he understands what the times require .
Her reputation is also her own .
I hope that God restores you to health .
Worse and worse !
And what did Surrey say to that ?
The duke and senators of Venice greet you .
In its tail .
How smooth and cool they seem !
Okay , but please not before me .
Do you see something wrong with that ?
No one should have an honor he doesn't deserve .
But I reversed the death sentence .
What did I do wrong ?
Didn't this frighten our captains , Macbeth and Banquo ?
Listen , sad friends , though the gods may rebuke me , this news would make kings cry .
I've shut the memory of your beautiful eyes out of my heart .
Well , whose is it ?
And you're right to do so .
You know where I'll be waiting .
I'm coming .
Here comes the king , the queen , and the noblemen of court .
Caliban !
With all my heart , I'll go right away .
I haven't seen him recently .
I don't mean he's
Will the moon be shining on the night we're performing our play ?
Is Fleance going with you ?
Are you a god ?
How can Caesar be a tyrant then ?
I'm going to make you a rich man .
The testament !
I'm not as happy as I seem .
People in high positions are shaken by many blasts of wind , and when they fall , they shatter into pieces .
Father , wife , friends , farewell !
Well , let's watch it .
I don't want to take another man's second-hand goods .
Yes , that's my husband's name .
I urge you to deliver your verdict .
Still the same old Cassius !
We'll meet at the giant oak tree in the duke's forest .
Hopefully when I get married , I'll give my husband half my love and half my sense of duty .
You didn't want to go then !
Well , my friends , you've got to admit that if you scare the living daylights out of the ladies , they'd have no choice but to execute us .
More of us are here .
I have an adventurous fairy who'll go seek out the squirrel's secret stash and get you some fresh nuts .
Be on guard duty tonight .
On one and the same trip Claribel found a husband in Tunis , and Ferdinand , her brother , found a wife where he was shipwrecked ; Prospero found his dukedom on a poor island ; and all of us found ourselves when we lost control of ourselves .
Have you heard something of her in your letters ?
There's hardly a bush for miles around .
When devoutly religious men are praying , it's hard to draw them out of it , because they get lost in the wonder of their contemplation .
The British troops are coming near .
If you hope to have your sins forgiven by Christ's dear blood , which He shed for our terrible sins , you must leave and keep your hands off me .
It is for your ears only .
Where have Come here , boy .
It's cheap and nasty !
We can not fight for love as men can .
You have the nerve to call me daughter ?
Come on in , tailor .
Trebonius knows his cue .
What's this ?
Is it not enough , is it not enough , young man , that I'll never be pretty enough to get a kind look from Demetrius ?
Tomorrow , Caesar , I'll be able to tell you what land and sea forces I can raise for this war .
Thank you , sir .
Now , my companions and brothers in exile , hasn't experience made this simple life sweeter than a life of glittery pomp and circumstance ?
What's the news ?
And what do you know , boy ?
I probably am too young for you .
Will you wait awhile ?
Then the Jew must show you mercy .
What an irreplaceable and grievous loss !
I hear his footsteps .
You know , you're right .
He's rushing on his way here right now , and Regan's with him .
Oh , just lies , sir .
I'm not talking with you .
So they think it's a good idea for you to watch a play and direct your thoughts toward laughter and merriment , two strong preventive medicines that foster long life .
the way trainers do with young hawks that flutter and flap and will not obey .
He remembers how unkind he was to her , how he disowned her and sent her abroad , how he gave her rightful inheritance to her two dog-hearted sisters .
My niece , you are welcome here as if you were my own daughter .
What are you talking about ?
No , none at all .
Please don't , sir .
Oh , but I'm worried .
Please , just walk with me a little ways , and tell me if I'll see you later tonight .
Who do you mean ?
Is Claudio your enemy ?
Destiny chooses when you'll die and who you'll marry .
Then no man has ever been honest .
What an ass I am .
Launcelot and I can't agree on anything .
Yours , Claudio , yours , I say .
While he was alive , I lived only to serve him and oppose his enemies .
Yes , and I'll keep crying a while longer .
Many men use that excuse to avoid giving gifts .
You think about him too much .
I swear I'll smack you if you hit me again .
Then he's the whining schoolboy , with a book bag and a bright , young face , creeping like a snail unwillingly to school .
I'm doing so .
Did you give everything to your two daughters and end up like this ?
Go ahead .
And leave us , Publius , in case the people storming us should harm you .
Take him off to jail !
I'll look for him and secretly help him .
That these crimes are punished so quickly is proof .
Keep listening .
It's clear that someone less noble , less loyal , more bloody-minded than Clarence but not a blood relation , deserves as bad an end as my brother , but he goes free .
Poor Antony !
Are you going to pay the eight shillings I won from you in a bet ?
This is the final discussion I will grant .
The Tower's chaplain has buried them , but to tell you the truth , I don't know where .
Do you think I would be feeling as triumphant as I am if I didn't know that our situation was secure ?
He mustn't go to prison .
You have seen the cruel proof of this man's strength .
When I like the way you look , for God forbid your face be as ugly as your mask !
Oh , you wicked scoundrel !
One of the sisters poisoned the other out of love for me , and then killed herself .
Oh , I hate looking at his face now !
That's impossible .
What's that ?
Where did you die ?
Why , what a complicated case this is !
Oh , and then at the very next turn , don't turn left or right , but turn down and around to the Jew's house .
Like a mouse caught in my own trap , Osric .
Give me your hand .
You sound like a pack of wolves howling at the moon .
So why did you laugh when I said that men don't interest me ?
No , I have a commitment .
I'm not much of a drinker .
Now , if you occupy some place in the list of men that isn't down at the very bottom , tell me .
You're looking for Lord Hamlet .
I only wish I could load him up with all the praise he deserves !
Get yourself to a church and have a proper priest , who can tell you what marriage is all about , marry you .
Now go find the forest ranger .
But so what ?
I obey all your thoughts .
What do you call this ?
Oh , royal Caesar !
What is my nation ?
Goodbye .
No , he was wicked and vile .
Their messengers are ready , waiting to deliver our response in these matters .
I still have room for six more wounds .
Get away from me !
Got it ?
Sir , you and I must part company , no , that's not it .
But let me try my luck on the boxes .
Her father loves you , Demetrius .
That's what I'm doing .
Just tell me what to do , and I'll do it .
But do this : find your brother , wherever he is .
Farewell , then , Signior Lucentio .
Did he beg my pardon ?
Keep your word .
I hope your love for me remains this strong for your entire life !
Then it's confirmed !
Has homely old age taken the alluring beauty from my poor cheeks ?
If we'd been able to put on our play , we would have had it made .
So the candle went out and now we're all in the dark .
I'm sure he had more hair on his tail than I have on my face when I last saw him .
Now that's done , I'm going to walk on the fortification walls .
And what are you going to do after you've spent your money ?
We're near his room now .
I think so too .
Oh , no , he's surely not in hell .
That's because you are near me , and you're as dazzling as the sun .
It's good we're doing this .
The rapier and the dagger .
We'll keep the lines of communication open between us .
Go wherever you want .
Why , my boy ?
I have promissory notes from Florence that I have to deliver .
I humbly thank you .
According to the laws of war , you didn't have to fight a stranger .
You'll both help me , right ?
Oh , what misery !
I don't trust you .
But where is my love ?
Cassio !
Arrest me if you dare .
It looks like a day when the sun is hidden .
Yes , from top to bottom , sir .
Are you headed to the Tower ?
And as you said ( and you said it wisely ) , it's good to have someone other than a mother listening in on them , since she can be too partial to him .
We're all against what Caesar stands for , and there's no blood in that .
I'll follow it .
But you can make it up to me .
Explain .
My countrymen , Silence !
I'll call you "Hamlet Senior , " "King , " "Father , " "royal Dane." Answer me !
She speaks daggers , and every word stabs .
It would be better for Macbeth to rule than someone like me .
If I were , I wouldn't need to ask you what happened .
Welcome back to Denmark , my lord .
But a handkerchief , God , I wish I could forget about the handkerchief !
Thank you .
Worse than that , she's polluted herself , so that the fountain is a place where disgusting toads copulate and reproduce !
When was the last time you saw my father ?
I'll give you cramps for saying that , horrible pains in your sides that will keep you from breathing .
You can do what you want , but he's an experienced and honorable soldier .
Why , so did you .
All I have to do is remove it .
Tell me truthfully , do you love my sister ?
About as long as it would take someone to count slowly to a hundred .
I leave him to you .
Don't try to find out more .
One thing is certain : he's out of control .
That's like building a bridge wider than the river it crosses .
If that is not granted , he reduces his requests and asks only that he be allowed to live as a private man in Athens .
It's been this way ever since the first government was organized .
Isn't that him heading this way ?
I'll tell you : it's because of a law as plain as Father Time's bald head .
Come on , relax , dear .
She can hide there and eavesdrop on our conversation .
Calphurnia's face is pale , and Cicero's eyes are as red and fiery as they get when senators are arguing with him at the Capitol .
It has the mark of
I'm going to make you look sharp , Laertes .
Amen .
I order you to come with me .
The things that threaten me have only seen my back .
She herself is as valuable as any dowry could ever be .
Are you talking , you villain ?
He won't get the better of me .
And Walter couldn't get his dagger out of its sheath .
To prison , until you're called into court .
BASSANIO Please , Leonardo , think about this I'll do my best .
Only men whom you wouldn't trust anyway would swear oaths , and for the worst reasons .
I'm a prince by birth , Miranda , maybe even a king now ; though I wish I weren't , and normally I wouldn't put up with carrying these logs any more than I'd let flies breed in my mouth .
I have nothing to say to you .
We should speak what we feel , not what we ought to say .
No .
He's offered me a lot of affection lately .
I'm your daughter .
will damage your reputation with them , and under ordinary circumstances it would be unfortunate to have them see you as an ogre .
Let's go , Nerissa. ,
Meanwhile , their They've said their prayers , and now they wait for death .
The good manners of the court look as silly in the country as country behavior is laughable at the court .
Take credit , God , for it is no one's doing but yours .
But whenever you feel a larger pain , the smaller one disappears .
I'm no less noble than you are , Edmund .
You seem a little depressed about this .
Wouldn't it be better , since I'm unusually tall for a woman , to dress myself like a man ?
Indeed , he's not right for this .
Pardon me ?
Too late , good Diomedes .
Where are you , Demetrius , you arrogant bastard ?
So , what's the news on the Rialto ?
Because you gave me something for nothing .
I've been crazed with so many miseries that my tongue has tired of lamenting and gone mute .
Have Montjoy hurry , then , Lord Constable , and have him ask the king of England what he is willing to pay us to get out of the war .
Where's my father ?
Go get me a crow .
You'll never see me again , whether or not he's dead .
That's true .
And what a slug Hastings is that he hasn't even arrived to tell us whether they're coming !
You certainly deserve it .
Happy that we're not too happy , lucky in being not too lucky .
Yes , and I'll give it to him for free .
I know you are loyal and honorable .
Let him think about his own debt .
So , my sweet brother-in-law , go inside .
Oh , dear husband , don't believe everything you hear , or if you must believe it , don't let it all make you angry .
This man looks like his business is urgent .
Antony will go where his passion is .
I do suffer love , because I love you against my will .
Be patient , madam .
I didn't , my lord .
Even the best jewel can be tarnished .
What do you say ?
Wait , sweet Beatrice .
But gods , you give us faults so we'll be human .
Here , Fluellen , stick this in your cap .
It is , my lord .
Oh , you villain , villain , you damned , smiling villain !
A woman who was beautiful but never proud , who could speak well but knew when to be quiet , who dressed well but was never overdressed , who had self-restraint even when she could get what she wanted , a woman who never took revenge , who overlooked it when people hurt her , who was too wise to do anything stupid , who could think without revealing her thoughts , and who could refrain from flirting with men in love with her , that kind of woman , if she ever existed , would , Would do what ?
She picks it up quick , doesn't she ?
Orlando .
Please , your Grace , tell me what crime I have committed .
I assure your majesty I'm only doing my duty both to my God and my good king .
I think you're more articulate .
Yes , I found him when he was asleep , so that's taken care of too , and the Athenian woman was sleeping near him .
I'll write to my sister and tell her my plans .
My dear Gloucester !
What soldiers , milk-face ?
I mean I will live on whatever I get , like birds do .
You are in a perilous state , shepherd .
You are very welcome here .
This will make our actions seem practical and not vengeful .
He turned away twice and almost left him there .
You're taking a shorter route .
If it does pass , the Church will lose more than half of what it possesses , because the bill would strip us of enough real estate left to the church by wealthy , pious men in their wills to support fifteen earls and fifteen hundred knights , six thousand two hundred squires , and a hundred well-supplied almshouses for the relief of lepers , old-age pensioners , the poor , and those too weak or sick to work .
Do you have desires ?
Do you recognize my voice , noble lord ?
Let's put our heads together .
Not true .
Where did they disappear to ?
No Corin , since you're old , you can not guess , even if you were as dedicated a lover in your youth as there ever was , sighing and mooning all night long .
EPHESUS Now what do you think ?
And could you please take my servant to old Shylock's house ?
That's our offer .
I know I won't please you .
My lord , they're waiting for you to give your daughter away to Claudio .
Who wouldn't cheat on her husband to make him king ?
But let me place this wreath on your head .
Tell us .
After all , who would put up with all life's humiliations , the abuse from superiors , the insults of arrogant men , the pangs of unrequited love , the inefficiency of the legal system , the rudeness of people in office , and the mistreatment good people have to take from bad , when you could simply take out your knife and call it quits ?
There we go !
Nell .
Or do you want me to criticize her like I do all women ?
We have to take the king's side .
Even that I could put up with .
Women are sex machines below the waist , though they're chaste up above .
There's been a whole debate on the topic .
where we quietly buried you , has opened up its heavy marble jaws to spit you out again .
Okay , now it starts !
And it's too bad that the Moor chose a man with such a deep-rooted drinking problem as his second-in-command .
You wouldn't know enough to be afraid of traps .
Name one .
Who was it that came here ?
What can you see out on the ocean ?
No , he's not .
I was just knocking to see if anyone was home .
I say it's the moon .
There's no need to be , really , for , You're my teacher , so I must believe you .
You come from heaven , don't you ?
Soldier , you must come to the king .
They can sit out there until they die of hunger and disease .
Listen up , uncle .
Welcome , good Cambio .
Come on and kiss me , Kate .
Brother , Quiet .
What's important is the urgency of this mission .
Hello !
I wish I could sleep too , it would stop me from thinking .
I swear on my honor that we saw and heard Hero talking to a brute at her window last night .
Come on , tie them up .
What's her name ?
Tell her to come here .
I don't know what to believe , father .
Ah , ladies , ladies !
Hush , Hortensio .
I don't doubt your wisdom .
I have come here to bury Caesar , not to praise him .
Good morning , Kate , for I hear that's what you're called .
Yes .
Well hello , my good boy .
You don't need it yet .
Hurry , go up to the roof .
So be it .
And just in time , here he comes with Sir Richard Ratcliffe .
Seek !
Oh , young and noble Cato , have you been slain ?
I'm speaking purely in analogies and comparisons .
Tonight he boarded a treasure ship .
They tell me you've done everything you can to talk him out of what he's doing .
If you're calling me Jephthah , my lord , I do have a daughter I love more than anything , yes .
A woman owes her husband the same loyalty a subject owes his king .
Bad times ?
Let's follow the old earl , and get that crazy Tom to take him wherever he wants to go .
Many men would take you literally and take off with all this money .
When the actors were talking about poison ?
What , I have to hold a candle up so people can see what I'm doing ?
Stop , even if only to kill me .
Keep an eye on her .
That's cowardly and womanish .
Yes , as much pleasure as one might take in choking a bird at knifepoint .
Get up , liar .
Why couldn't you be attended by my servants , or by Regan's ?
He'll bring a lot of money to the person who owns him , that's for sure .
He wants me dead .
It's my best option : I can't afford to lose forty ducats .
I think I can do that .
Who are you ?
Do you think Alexander the Great looked like this when he was buried ?
Sirs , I ask you to sleep in my tent .
Look in the almanac .
He recognizes me like a blind man recognizes a cuckoo , by its bad voice .
Oh , Pyramus , get up !
Who pleaded with me to pardon
Come with me .
Good Enobarbus , you would be doing a very good thing if you advised your captain to speak calmly and quietly .
I'll stop by before you go to bed , and tell you what I've heard .
Oh , Antony , Antony , Antony !
When I said that , I told you the truth .
Where's this so-called king ?
Are my master and his wife coming , Grumio ?
Well , you can go now .
Then why did you have to stick it in your pocket in such a hurry ?
If you do intend to live , then mourn .
Good news , good news !
She is so generous , kind , and ready to help that she thinks it's wrong not to do everything she can , even more than she is asked to do .
Oh , I wish I were a man !
It's worthless .
Fast asleep ?
Now I'll ask Cassio about Bianca , a prostitute who sells her body for food and clothes .
Is that his answer ?
Some water will fix that .
What would you like , Laertes ?
Now everyone be seated , as this is the part where we sit and chat as well as eat .
Lady Luck is a fickle whore And never gives the poor a break .
Be a careful mother , madam , and think about your son , the young prince .
Peter , did you ever see anything like it ?
Unless I am mistaken , Signior Baptista may remember me from the Pegasus in Genoa , where we both stayed twenty years ago .
God keep me so. , Heralds , go with him .
And what would that accomplish ?
Sad or happy ?
Lorenzo , please take charge of the management of my house until my husband comes back .
I don't like that .
Hello , Curan .
I couldn't pay my debt to the Jew on the due date .
But action speaks louder than words , so I'll cut short these polite words .
Do as I say .
Since the youth won't be reasoned with , he'll have to suffer for his stubbornness .
You've already done something you should be sorry for .
The king will be offended to find out that his messenger is so badly treated .
Look at this , here is the man , scarred , as you can see , by traitors .
I'll be nearby .
But I slip from underneath her and she falls down , crying , "Ow , my butt ! " and starts coughing , and then everyone laughs and has fun .
Lead the way .
He's definitely the most active gentleman of France .
Oh , forgive all my sins !
I'll call for you soon .
Ah , my lord , this prince is nothing like Edward !
Well said !
I'll put up my shield and battle you .
Lysander , where are you going with all this ?
Just notice .
Nonsense !
That's old news .
Don't be afraid .
I like doing things the old-fashioned way .
He ran to his house , stunned .
Baby blooms are most susceptible to disease .
I'm sorry about your daughter's death , but I swear our accusations were true , and backed up with proof .
I'll give you frets ! " With that , she clobbers me with the lute so that my head goes right through ,
Why did I come here if not for that ?
May God's arm strike on our side !
Nothing , my lord , or if I did , I don't know what .
Or are you just teasing ?
Is your master coming ?
Is this really happening ?
My lord of Gloucester , I have suffered your blunt upbraidings and your bitterness toward me for too long .
No more talk about killing yourself , okay ?
Where , sir ?
Go get me something I can use to break down the door .
Tell them to slick down their hair , brush their blue coats , and make sure their socks match .
To be honest , I don't know why I'm so sad .
Were these things we're talking about really here ?
Go ahead , do your worst .
We can't wait here .
He does hear me , and that makes me cry .
Lord Hastings , will you go with me ?
Let's go .
Ah , dear Nature , my goddess , listen to me !
Then I guess beggars are the ones with bodies , while ambitious kings and heroes are just the shadows of beggars .
But your words are as sweet as honey , you've stolen from the bees and left them with nothing .
And my heart too .
I'll catch it before it falls to the ground .
I'm glad to see you .
You didn't give me any gold .
It's wrong for the duke to do this .
ate at home , but the jeweler says he didn't .
You take the bill and I'll take your yardstick .
Your features , God help us !
Tyranny is dead !
Come on , you're a fool , and driven to extreme measures by love .
His name is Balthazar .
And , in fact , I think they're meeting together right now .
Do you want me to lie , madam ?
To tell you that you'll see me at Philippi .
We'll see , won't we ?
Ha , ha , ha !
They show their bloody heralds of battle , and something must be done immediately .
You're making me go off-key .
It's difficult to bring two friends together , but even mountains can be moved together by earthquakes .
If he is , that's his problem .
For heaven's sake , stop this savage brawl !
Ah , there's the problem .
Well , I'll go hide the body in some hole until the duke gives orders for his burial .
I told you before , and I'll tell you again and again : I hate the Moor .
Leonato , am I standing here ?
Greetings , Caesar , my lord !
The nasty devil's biting my butt .
In return , I must clear the sea of pirates and send tributes of wheat to Rome .
Oh , sir , pardon me !
If I live through this , I'll be good to you .
If you forgive my mistake , I swear I'll never break an oath with you again .
I thought you were resolved to do this .
It shall be seven o'clock before I get on my horse .
Either there are wars in heaven , or else the world , too insolent toward the gods , provokes them to send destruction .
I'm a gentleman , sir , and my name is Conrade .
Oh , just see what happens after the pageantry is over !
Mustardseed .
No , Lysander .
Don't move , dog .
Most noble Antony !
You don't think you can teach her ?
You mean the sun !
He's praying now .
That was nothing .
And when I'm king , remember to ask me for the earldom of Hereford and all the possessions that go with it , which my brother the king used to own .
He's too overwhelmed with shame .
Lock the doors .
You devil , you've put a spell on her !
My lord , we were sent for .
My lord , I'll do it right away .
Is this well done ?
Cassio's a handsome man .
Tomorrow , my lord .
No , it would be impossible .
Even though she's as similar to Goneril as one crabapple is like another , still, I know what I know .
Are you mad ?
I will .
There's still a spot here .
I'm happiest of all that I'm yours now , my lord , my king , and you can guide me as you wish .
Should I go convince my daughter to marry you ?
Would you ever do such a thing for all the world ?
This toast is for Lepidus !
Let's not leave him out .
Is that how it's going to be ?
Thus , I'll leave without being kissed .
Say goodbye to your sisters .
I leave him in your care , but oh , if only I were still in his favor I could arrange for better care for him .
My brother is imprisoned because of you , I am disgraced , and the nobility are held in contempt while those who two days ago weren't worth a dime have suddenly been promoted .
But tell me this : don't you know my voice ?
I'll take responsibility for it .
Loss upon loss !
But when exactly will we see Benedick married ?
Is that the man ?
You see how kind everyone is to us , how they just hand us gold .
And like mine , but I'm getting a little tired of it .
You abused me to my face .
Really , niece , you'll never get a husband if you keep saying such harsh things about people .
We have not yet set the coronation day .
Whether you are sad or merry , the intensity of either suits you like no one else.. .
But back to that argument you mentioned .
Good morning , Prince ; good morning , Claudio .
I don't feel so well , but I won't stop .
What's going on ?
Therefore , by law , you are condemned to die .
Really , my lord , why are you so excessively sad ?
We haven't even talked about who'll be our torchbearers .
Come , Ariel , I summon you with a thought .
Your life has had honor in it .
As for this slave , Iago , if we can think of any torture that will hurt him a lot but keep him alive a long time , he'll have it .
Either let heaven send lightning to strike the murderer dead or let the earth open wide and devour him , as it does this good king's blood .
Okay , now I'm dead .
Calphurnia , my wife , is keeping me at home .
What a tedious wait !
What do kings have that private men do not , besides the pomp of their position ?
You good-for-nothing , let me in .
I can tell you're furious , but I don't understand what you're saying .
Here comes Catesby again .
Doesn't the sun shine palely down on them , as though in contempt , killing their fruit with frowns ?
Would you tie me to a whole world of worries ?
He must be very near by now .
No , sir .
This isn't a monster , it's a devil .
We'll drive them to a
You're wrong , sir , very wrong .
Please , come to his house with me .
Madam , I'd rather sew my lips shut than tell a lie when my life depends upon it .
Oh , and young men never die ?
Now go , and hurry back .
I wanted to teach her how perfectly I love her , kinsman , and that's good English .
God , not our strength , be praised !
I didn't , either .
Well gentlemen , we've heard our assignment .
I had to hurry to my love , beautiful Helena , who lights up the night better than all those fiery stars .
No sir , trust me , I do not .
The fool's nice enough , but he's such a huge eater , and slow as a snail when he works .
That's him , madam .
The Prince and Claudio are supposed to be here by now. , You know your job , brother .
Macbeth !
Thank you .
Read the will !
You're sure the handwriting is your brother's ?
What's that supposed to mean ?
If you dressed only to stay warm , you wouldn't need these gorgeous clothes you're wearing , which don't keep you warm at all .
We've been betrayed !
Asses are made for bearing , and so are you .
What , is today a holiday ?
And you have to cut this flesh from his chest .
First of all , Pyramus has to take out a sword to kill himself , which the ladies in the audience won't be able to stand .
My darling , when I gave my love to you , I told you that all the wealth I had ran within my veins , that I have noble blood , but no money .
I'll call it "Bottom's Dream" because it's so deep that it has no bottom .
He looks humbler than he used to .
You've already stained our sheets with your lust ; now I'll stain them with your whore's blood .
What is a traitor ?
And your experience makes you sad .
You should know that when I came here I was prepared to accept your offer .
It's undeniable .
We've been waiting a long time for this day .
The guilty speak volumes even when they're silent .
I saw him once .
Grumio , get me my horse .
I'm being repaid for that now .
Now that the wind is favorable , let's board the ship .
Tomorrow , soldier , I'll fight by sea and land .
Look behind you , my lord .
Here .
Do you think they're married ?
And how do you like Lord Bassanio's wife ?
But look , even if my dishes are poor , eat them with my best wishes .
What , should I stab him while he sleeps ?
You want me to say what I'm thinking ?
Anyway , he is what he is .
Next time I'll give you nothing for something .
He's getting worse and worse .
Sir , the king , Yes , what about him ?
Losers always leave quickly .
I'll run , devil .
But Brutus says he was ambitious , and Brutus is an honorable man .
Say goodbye to me .
Let's embrace
Now , as you're a Roman , tell me the truth .
I can't believe it .
Hello , Iago .
Answer me this , please : where's the money I gave you ?
Have you seen Master Lorenzo !
Everyone who comes to gamble on winning me has to swear to these three rules .
Tell him I'm sick .
I'll challenge him .
Then learn this from me : if you have something , you have it .
Your worst fault is being in love .
And if your clothes were as thin as mine , you'd really feel the air .
Who are you ?
Too bad it fell flat .
Doesn't a Jew have hands , bodily organs , a human shape , five senses , feelings , and passions ?
It's not good for your health , either .
Then you and I and all of us fell down , while bloody treason triumphed .
That's why he hates me .
Fathers , never trust your daughters just because they act obedient and innocent .
The evil that men do is remembered after their deaths , but the good is often buried with them .
But how long will her beautiful life last ?
I humbly thank you , sir .
You're coming here yourself to see the dreaded act you had tried to stop .
You have all served me well , and kings are your peers .
I've got a plan that will fix everything .
He's a good man .
My lord , could I have a word with you ?
I hope lightning strikes her in the eyes !
What kind of game is this ?
Thank you , sir .
Please , will you take his arm ?
I'm going back into battle .
I was talking to some Venetians down by the shore , and the fool showed up .
Sir , your age and status inspire more respect than your weapons do .
Peter Quince , What is it , jolly Bottom ?
I'll deliver the message .
The enemy's losses have been very great , pretty substantial .
And when you want to go to sleep , I'll be up laughing like a hyena .
Give a quick example .
Go , Mardian , and let me know how he reacts to my death .
If you hadn't shown up on cue , my lord , Lord Hastings was going to take your part , I mean , he was going to speak for you , in the crowning of the king .
I've always had great respect for your destiny .
Your highness will have to force me to tell .
What a backward world we live in !
Have you forgotten her ?
Two or three of us have seen strange things .
God say , "Amen" !
So don't think that I'm drunk .
According to what I heard , they had no travel plans as of last night .
He'd be quite a monster if his eyes were in his tail .
Goodbye , boy .
You give your best praise to the worst women .
I can remember the past seventy years pretty well , and in all that time I have seen dreadful hours and strange things .
Let's discuss it some more .
If you would take the trouble to study the tactics of Pompey the Great , I can tell you that you would find no tittle-tattle or pibble-pabble in Pompey's camp .
And isn't your husband an honorable man ?
It's a reason for suspicion , even though it's just a dream .
Yes , dear madam .
Then she ran away to grieve alone .
Drive it out of you .
Captain Jamy is a wonderfully valorous gentleman , that's certain , one with great learning and knowledge concerning ancient warfare , I happen to know from his maneuvers .
Yes , my lord , if you give us permission .
Let's go offer up our lives
Say , "That splendid Antony." The courageous Caesar !
And there comes Caesar .
Defend me , God , both when I'm asleep and when I'm awake .
What is your wish with regard to her ?
Aren't you Kent ?
I can't speak any more .
Greetings , dearest Caesar !
You can give good news in many ways , but let bad news interpret itself as you tell it .
Oliver , your brother , no , not your brother ; and yet he's the son , but no , I won't call him the son , of that great man I was about to call his father , has heard about how well you did in the wrestling match , and tonight he's planning on burning your house down , with you in it .
My soul is full of sorrow .
I'm amazed how similar you and your daughters are .
That counts for everything .
As I said before , Antonio will guarantee the loan .
Where are you going ?
Thank you for asking , uncle .
Caius Ligarius doesn't like Caesar , who berated him for speaking well of Pompey .
First kiss me , Kate , and then we will .
My doors were locked and I was shut out , right ?
Let's go !
You are not , Cassius .
Has Fortune turned on me , like the whore she is ?
He's given me a second life , and marrying her makes him a second father to me .
No , you can't do that until you take her hand and , in front of this friar , swear to marry her .
On me , though I am barely half the man that Edward was ?
Tonight we'll have dinner .
It has caused the downfall of many kings .
I understand now .
Wait a minute .
I wish I could give you the little strength that I have .
Get away from me , Satan !
There have never been orphans who've suffered what we have .
I know the people of Venice well .
Young girls call it "love-in-idleness." Bring me that flower .
Which one of you is Beatrice ?
How is she ?
It is not destiny's fault , but our own faults , that we're slaves .
Gloucester , Gloucester , I want to speak with the Duke of Cornwall and his wife .
Do you know Captain Gower ?
If you've been ordered back to Venice because of my father , don't blame me .
You don't ?
Come over here .
Tell every soldier to break off a branch and hold it in front of him .
He brought many captives home to Rome whose ransoms brought wealth to the city .
He looks calmer than he did before .
But I promise you , Kate : the older I grow the better I'll look .
Knock , knock !
Why are you giving me his title ?
Are the others waiting ?
Absolutely , if you can find a wife by then .
But it's enough to know that the day will end , and then the end will be known .
My lord , what do you want ?
From my kind uncle , who I know will give it to me , especially as it's not worth much .
I wonder why Cambio hasn't shown up in all this time .
She blushes at the slightest thing .
No , calm down .
The mercy that was alive in me a moment ago was smothered and killed by your own advice .
Your eyes are playing tricks on you .
Well , let's sit down and listen to Barnardo tell us .
Uncle , please give me your dagger .
Instead of crying , let's keep hold of our swords and defend our fallen homeland like honorable men .
I guess it's only one man , no big deal .
Here and now I seem like Antony , but I can't keep myself in this form , my boy .
And that's all there is to it .
I wouldn't marry her , even if she were as blessed as paradise .
What does this mean ?
Tell them to capture me , then sell my bones .
I think you're my mirror , not my brother .
I'm warning you .
A snake did do it , because no snake ever had a more forked , lying tongue than you have .
You must not go without having a drink first .
Don't be scared .
Be invisible to everyone except yourself and me .
Then he pulled a watch from his bag and , looking at it solemnly , said , "It's ten o'clock .
If this business would really be finished when I did the deed , then it would be best to get it over with quickly .
I will my lord , as fast as I can .
Now that I think about it , I really want it .
A man who achieves more in war than his captain does becomes his captain's rival .
This poor guy's partly confessed his plan .
But what can be done to prevent it ?
My worthy Cawdor !
I know she trusts you and tells you everything .
And
Sadness is only appropriate for funerals .
I'll go back to sleep now .
Who are you , slave ?
We heard that once you were served eight wild boars roasted whole for breakfast , for only twelve people !
I remember this fellow , he once played the eldest son of a farmer .
How short am I ?
Yes , a dozen of them , as many as there are women in the world , in fact .
I'll recite something for you , guy .
The silk came from sacred silkworms , and it was dyed with fluid made from embalmed virgins ' hearts .
I don't know what "poetical" means .
Farewell , sir .
No , lovely princess .
Let's seek out some shady place where we can sit down alone and cry our hearts out .
Barnardo's taken my place .
Seyton !
Lead them inside .
Damn your stones for disappointing me like this !
Why does the world report that Kate is lame ?
Come on , come on .
Show .
Cassio , do you know who might have stabbed you like this ?
Really , I'll help .
But this storm in my mind keeps me from feeling anything except what's tormenting me , how ungrateful my children are !
For , as I am a soldier , the name I think suits me best , once I begin my attack on Harfleur again , I will not leave the half-conquered town until she lies buried in her own ashes .
I'll have my lessons in the order and manner
Brutus , my country's friend .
But there is no end , absolutely none , to my sexual desires .
Let's slash their backs and grab 'em like we do rabbits , from behind .
Your Highnesses can both attest to the fact that I've strived mightily , with all my wits and energy , to bring about this royal meeting between you two imperial Majesties .
Now I'm Dromio and no longer attached to him .
Just now .
Until then , I have to remain calm .
Me too , I swear .
Friends , go .
Please , Signior Gremio .
I see you like to make big offers , sir .
I'd do it myself , but I can't leave my post .
I swear by the mass , before I close my eyes to go to sleep , I'll put in some good fighting , or I'll lie in the ground dead .
Good old knight , gather them all together at my tent .
Thank God" , that's a good answer .
Enough !
Have a safe trip .
What a silly monster , to think a poor drunk is wonderful .
Why , what's the matter ?
Said what , sir ?
Until Birnam Wood gets up and moves to Dunsinane , I won't be affected by fear .
Stay hidden and listen .
Be at ease .
No , listen to it , Antony .
I'll move to a more open place and there speak to great Caesar as he walks past .
Good madam , let me speak .
But jealous people don't think like that .
If any ships are sailing , I'll get right on one .
Here was a Caesar !
You're going to pay for this , Roderigo .
Varrus and Claudio !
If you had been afraid to break an oath with him , the crown you are currently wearing would have graced the head of my child , and both princes would still be alive , not preyed on by worms .
If every time you wished for a child you could have had one , you would have a million children .
Don't be sad that this happened because of you , because Lady Luck's been nicer to me than usual .
If there are any , speak , for it is he whom I've offended .
Fa , sol , la , mi .
Put a lot of cash together .
I beg you to pay a visit right away to my son , who's changed too much .
And did you see the handkerchief ?
My lord , His Majesty wanted me to tell you that he's placed a large bet on you .
I'll tell you this , Constable , my mistress has his own hair .
My own safety is the only important thing now .
But you've raised me as a peasant , hiding from me what I needed to become a gentleman .
I'll tell everyone what you did , even if it
Now my spells are all broken , And the only power I have is my own , Which is very weak .
It is my rival for Bianca .
You weren't given any gold ?
To die for adultery ?
Sister , I have a lot to say about things that concern us both .
Well , that's the same thing .
The hour has almost come when I have to return to the horrible flames of purgatory .
It's a strange snake .
How I wish you felt better !
They'll assume that Cicero , with his sound judgment , ordered the actions .
All the rumors have been confirmed .
I've seen the whole thing , and it's completely worthless , unless you think their bad acting and their misremembered lines , which they memorized so painfully , are funny .
Come with me , Silvius .
And then what would I do with him ?
Dear Macduff , I beg you , tell us you were lying and say it isn't so .
God give you joy , Petruchio .
Cast spells with them , and "Brutus" will call up a ghost as well as "Caesar." Now , in the name of all the gods , I ask you what food does Caesar eat that has made him grow so great ?
You'd break a date with your beloved by a whole hour ?
But is he often like this ?
If I see anything tonight that convinces me not to marry her , I'll shame her tomorrow in the very congregation where I would have married her .
Yes , that one .
That's true .
Doesn't he deserve it ?
The table's full .
As for me , I'll leave when I like .
Look !
Please come closer. , Make the music louder , please !
This isn't the death of one man .
Listen to you !
Now get on with your story .
Take a few steps , I want to see you walk .
Young gentleman , you are too bold for your age .
Hey , if I'd remembered something about him , I could have had a good comeback for my uncle , touching on his growth worse than he touched on mine .
The king's son , Ferdinand , with his hair standing straight up , it looked like reeds , not hair , was the first person to jump , shouting , "Hell is empty , and all the devils are here ! " Good job !
Come , come , hurry up .
The ones you've sent our lunatic king to .
It would be better if you actually applied it to your life .
I'll put on some poor and ragged clothes and smudge my face with dirt .
What !
That's for to me to decide .
There's no room for the old man and his followers .
Whoever's a real friend should strike me dead .
To hell with this idiot !
This is healthy talk .
Meet me down at the harbor. , Come here .
And that will save a partridge wing from being eaten , because he'll be too miserable for dinner .
Hurry now , get the job done .
Certainly , I did .
Good God , I was about to say something .
I love you all the more for not liking it .
And you , go call my fool .
I don't know him .
But I'm running ahead of myself .
Please , leave me alone .
Is there a scale here to weigh the flesh ?
No ?
Whose was it ?
Show him and make him grieve .
He died like someone who had practiced how to toss away his most cherished possession as if it were a worthless a piece of garbage .
And I swear to God he's very smart .
And on their graves , I trust , the story of this day's work will be written in brass .
Come on , servant , come .
Look , here comes a walking fire .
And , being a man of your breeding , you're going to be married under some shrubs like a beggar ?
I'm wide awake .
We are responsible for this .
So go away .
That's what I intend to do too .
Put your straw hats on , have some fun , and dance with these young nymphs .
I'd like to munch on some good dry oats .
They grow like savages , like soldiers who meditate on nothing but blood , surrounded by swearing and stern looks , ragged clothing and everything unnatural .
I won't beg the gods to punish you , or caution you to fear their judgment .
Look , here comes the woman you love .
But like an unruly deer , he's always trespassing past the park borders and straying away from home to feed in new pastures .
My mind is confused .
We must form a better opinion of ourselves if our uprising can pull the insatiable Antony's attention away from that Egyptian widow .
The glowworm's light is beginning to fade , so morning is near .
I have the best armor in the world .
In emergencies you meet the strangest folks .
Damn those words , "but yet ! " "But yet" is like a jailer about to bring out some horrible criminal .
May God in His mercy forgive you .
Well , we'll stop , then .
Wicked woman , these white hairs you're pulling off my chin will come to life and accuse you of wrong-doing .
I was reminded of my son , even though I despised my son at that time .
Yes , my lord , but I can spoil it .
Here ,
Mark Antony is in your tents , my lord .
Come on , close the curtain , Nerissa .
You , fellow , step out of the crowd .
I beg you , turn away and cry for her .
I can't blame you , old lord .
Listen !
Made it for me ?
My eyes itch , is that an omen I'll be crying soon ?
If you wish .
Her curses have made my hair stand on end .
He doesn't have any daughters , sir .
Make Cassio angry somehow , either by speaking too loud , or insulting his military skills , or however else you want .
Please tell him I have surrendered to his fortune .
What an enormous thing for us to forget ! , Edmund , tell us , where's the king ?
Help us carry these clothes to where my barrel of wine is hidden , or I'll kick you out of my kingdom .
The ground feels flat to me .
With whom ?
We chase everything in life more excitedly than we actually enjoy it when we get it .
Take it to your master and bring him home immediately .
Sir , such a life with such a wife is unlikely !
Let four captains carry Hamlet like a soldier onto the stage .
I'll make Oliver find him .
Thank you .
The gods can hear you lying !
Be quiet and listen to me .
Go into the bedroom and see for yourself .
I'll steal away to England , and I'll steal some more when I get there .
Isn't she a well-mannered young lady ?
If I ever come back , I'll bring you good news .
You fell from the terrifying top of this chalk cliff .
This madman will murder me .
Ariel , go order my goblin servants to make these fellows ' bones ache , give them muscle cramps all over , and give them more bruises than leopards have spots .
Did he stare at you ?
Your wives , your daughters , your old women , and your young maids together could not satisfy my lust .
Tell him to greet the king of England with our sharp defiance .
Call Cleopatra what the Romans call her .
Well , then , what are you messing up ?
Quiet !
Well , this is what happens when men let themselves be ruled by women .
Thank you kindly .
So , possessing neither a voice nor a heart for flattery , I can't awaken the spirit of love in her so as to make him appear in his true likeness .
You won't kill me , will you ?
Are you squinting at me ?
So far I've done exactly what I was supposed to do , I put the love potion on an Athenian's eyes .
Who's this ?
Where's America and the West Indies ?
Oh no , good Cassio !
Are you ashamed of me ?
Where are you running so fast ?
What's it to you ?
Meet me and Gratiano at his house in about an hour .
It was a good and lucky vision .
Well , there you go .
Like the wind , I must have the freedom to blast anyone I please , as fools do .
Let me live here forever .
I'm sure you and my husband will be as friendly as you were before .
You're trying to trick me , my lord .
They're forgiven , then , if they don't see what they're doing .
Do you see that cloud up there that looks like a camel ?
I'm going now .
I did it myself .
One more thing , good gentlemen .
Let's act quickly .
It's nothing , my lord .
Help , help , help !
But how long will "ever" last ?
It's gone .
If she offers him her love , it's very possible that he'll scorn it , since , as we all know , he tends to be contemptuous .
If I live long enough to touch you again , that would be as good as having my eyesight back .
Sadly , it's the king that's missing .
First you taught me how to beg , and now I think you're teaching me how a beggar should be answered .
And even though you know I'm very close to the Prince and Claudio , I swear I'll keep your counsel and deal with this secretly and justly .
Hey , hey !
God will revenge it .
And she's loyal , as she has proven .
Gentlemen , calm down .
We must preserve our goodwill toward each other and not break into factions again .
Well there , now you've said it .
I never saw the necklace , so help me heaven !
Give me your hand .
And now you know my meaning .
Yes , I did , my lord .
It's impossible .
If you make the accusation convincingly , then my cunning won't fail me .
As good a wife as she is , that's how good a husband I am to you .
Good job , my little one .
I'd rather bear with you than Well , this is the Forest of Arden .
Oh , fine .
If I had three ears I'd listen with all three .
Here's why : it'd be better for the enemy to come after us .
Don't trouble him further until his mind is more settled .
The king wishes to know if you want to play against him right away , or wait awhile .
My father , led by a poor peasant ?
Quiet !
Is that how the law sees it ?
Oh Margaret , Margaret , your heavy curse has now landed on poor Hastings's miserable head !
She is banished .
Why , so did you .
Well , that's certainly out of this world , all right .
Why , too much freedom leads to woe .
Let's be angry only long enough to do the deed , and then let's act like we're disgusted by what we had to do .
Where should I go ?
The friar's ready .
Horatio , tell me something .
But that is a false conclusion , since we have locks to keep our valuables safe and clever traps to catch little thieves .
Good question , my girl .
Demetrius loves her , and he doesn't love you .
So I'd like it copied .
But leave it all to God .
I like this girl !
Okay , let's go !
So it is on earth .
Awake , my lords !
My spirit friend , Harpier , is yelling , "It's time , it's time ! " Dance around the cauldron and throw in the poisoned entrails .
Of course .
Yes .
Welcome home , Grumio .
Are you backing away in fear ?
He'll stay as long as I say .
Hurry , hurry , close the curtain quick .
Let's go up to the castle .
My eyesight has always been bad .
No , afterward .
Long live Theseus , our famous and respected duke !
Halfway down the cliff there's somebody clinging to the rock and gathering wild herbs , a risky business !
An excellent motion .
If there's anything more sorrowful left to add , keep it to yourself .
I would have thought she was invincible against any assault of love .
You , niece .
Good cousin , good Meg , good Ursula , come help me get dressed .
Me too , lieutenant .
Why , Fool ?
No , sir .
I'm tired of it , and you say you're tired of it too .
Trinculo , if you interrupt him any more , I swear I'll knock some teeth out of your head .
Your wife wouldn't like it if she were here to hear you make that offer .
A snake could do that as easily as you could .
Fled to England ?
Damn you !
Tell her you heard us , and that she should sneak into the arbor where the crisscrossing branches overhead keep the honeysuckles out of the sun .
He followed you .
Ring the alarm bell .
I'll try to persuade him to put on something more appropriate before going to the church , if it's at all possible .
Very soon , because you want it .
Tell the constable that .
Orlando sends his regards to you both , and he sends this bloody handkerchief to the boy he calls "his Rosalind." Is that you ?
I thank my heart , the poor fool , for it keeps away from seriousness .
How is it , my husband , oh , how is it , that you have become a stranger to yourself ?
What do you think that means ?
Be good enough to hear me out .
Oh , this is terrible !
Large and increasing .
No , girl !
When Caesar was alive , even he wouldn't dare anger me like this .
And what will you do if it returns to you ?
Wake up , I say !
But have you put the love juice from the flower on the eyes of that Athenian , as I asked you to do ?
They drink Danes under the table , and it takes them no effort at all to out-drink Germans .
Then I guess the whole world is one .
Am I all alone ?
How am I unfaithful ?
He's certainly crossed the river Somme .
The man should be inside the lantern .
Certainly , your grandmother had a worse match .
What have you done ?
Your mother sends her blessings .
Good night , everyone .
If he wakes up before we kill him , he'll never stop punishing us .
He looked to the side , and pay attention to what he saw then : under an oak tree , whose lower branches were mossy with age and top branches ancient and brittle , he saw a wretched beggar , with overgrown hair and beard , asleep on his back .
Ha !
Very well .
What is my nation ?
Bless your five senses !
The French ambassador arrived at that moment and asked to see the king .
God bless your Worship !
My dear clever Ariel , listen carefully .
Read it .
Are you considering desertion , as well ?
There's justice in heaven after all !
Oh , where have you led me , Egypt ?
Find out where the Jew's house is .
You couldn't find out anything about them ?
Well , go on your way , then .
Shake off sleep , which looks like death , and look at death itself !
Tell me your secrets .
That's what makes it "sensitive" news .
Signior Gremio , are you coming from the church ?
Whenever you're ready , hostess .
I know that , sir .
I'm a soldier , more experienced than you , and better able to give orders .
There is no rest to be had in any bedroom where you are !
Never , my lord .
How will that kill this marriage ?
To escape the decree condemning me
Hello , spirit !
What , my dear lord ?
Now let Richmond and Elizabeth , the true heirs of each royal house , be joined together !
But was this near the shore ?
I never saw him like this before .
I ran into her recently at the edge of the forest , looking for sweet presents for this hateful idiot , and I scolded her and argued with her .
Thank you , madam .
Well then , God forgive me !
Boatswain !
You'll discover that his youthful follies were like the persona that Well , you're wrong , my Lord High Constable .
You're right , Lysander's admirable too .
Why , dear child ?
Good morning to you .
I am at your service .
Give us answers .
He who is dizzy thinks the world is spinning" , please , tell me what you meant by that .
Here comes his Majesty .
I'd give it all up , yes , I'd sacrifice them all to this devil here , to save you .
Speak plainly .
Where are the thousand
Alas , I hate myself instead , because of the hateful deeds I've committed .
It's like this : as long as a person tells me the truth , even though it means my death , I will listen as though he praised me .
Your speech is more refined than I would expect in such a remote place as this .
That's a nasty garter belt .
Friendship is enduring except when love is involved .
I was afraid this would happen , because he was a noble , brave man , but I didn't think he had a weapon .
It wouldn't be right for me to tell you everything I've seen and heard .
This is a stranger business than men have ever set foot in before , and it's not natural either .
Why , then , it's my body's doomsday .
Antonio's a good man .
I know I may be old , but I'm strong and healthy , because in my youth I never drank nor lived recklessly .
Come with me , sir .
No , madam .
I bet she'll chew him out .
People who are either too serious or too silly are awful .
What do you mean by all this ?
Well , Petruchio , all this is very encouraging .
You ought to be ashamed of yourself !
You're my lieutenant now .
Either my eyes deceive me , or I see two husbands .
So you don't love me ?
Or just a foretaste of it ?
which any peace-lover can do .
Isn't today the day when Hermia has to tell us her decision about whether she'll marry Demetrius ?
He's been captured or killed .
Get out of my sight .
Since I'm suddenly all the rage , it will be worth the cost .
Then tell me if Antonio can be called a brother .
Tell the actors to hurry .
Leave me for a bit .
My beautiful Rosalind , I'm only an hour late .
Yes , he will , and the queen as well .
Yes , for your own safety , you should deny one thing : you have been a great thief at sea .
And how would we go about doing that ?
He's laughing already !
How ?
She is worse than wicked .
Oh , sir , someone would think I was a good fake .
Now , daughter Katherine ?
I must admit your offer is the best .
Merciful heaven !
Yes , we talked for a couple of hours .
This used to be a great puzzle , but now I've solved it .
Otherwise I would have been perfect , as solid as a piece of marble , as firm as a rock , as free as the air itself .
My lord the ruler of Burgundy , I'll speak to you first .
I don't know why I should be afraid , since I haven't done anything wrong .
You're a well-dressed lady .
Give me your arm .
Is it possible for a mutt to lend three thousand ducats ? " Or should I bend down low , and in a humble and submissive voice say :
The wind is filling your ship's sail , and they're waiting for you .
He was on his way here with your wife .
Give them hefty meals of beef and iron and steel , and they will eat like wolves and fight like devils .
The world is a bad place , where you can't speak what you know .
I admit I'm only a woman , but I'm still a woman from a noble family , I'm Cato's daughter .
Pretty lady , I'm much ashamed of your shocking behavior .
Yes , my lord .
Who's coming with her ?
If I were you with eyes and a tongue to speak with , I'd crack heaven wide open with my laments !
Now you're talking .
Why should he call her a whore ?
But don't go .
Yes , madam , that's the one .
I'm not feeling well , that's all .
And I followed him because I loved him .
A knight on a quest ?
I say he shall go to prison .
Hurry up , Audrey , hurry. , I'm coming , I'm coming .
I have to do these things before I have a chance to think about them .
We did a lot of drinking in Egypt .
You don't know how quickly affection can be killed with a single nasty word .
So much for Fortinbras .
I would have been what I am even if the most virginal star in the heavens had twinkled at my conception .
Well then , he's God's soldier now !
tody of them so I can do what's best out of concern for their honor and the safety of the kingdom .
What blessed work , my king .
And to make it even clearer , we can tell them that I'm playing Pyramus but I'm not really Pyramus , really , I'm Bottom the weaver .
Follow your spirit , and as you charge cry , "God for Harry , England , and Saint George ! "
Kent can speak rudely when Lear goes mad .
You're older than me .
We want answers .
And make sure the servants are less friendly to his knights .
He's changed a great deal .
You're not in love either ?
I'm sorry my noble brother is suspicious of me .
Yes , exactly .
You could only imitate his imperfections so well if you were the man himself .
Is his ship sturdy ?
But all of you , remember what you've said and prove yourselves true Romans .
I could have sworn he trampled on me .
You'll take the mustard or you'll get no beef from Grumio .
His daughter and I will be king and queen , God protect us ! , and you and Trinculo will be our governors. , Do you like that idea , Trinculo ?
That will happen before sunset .
It is the best horse in Europe .
I'll fetch him .
My good qualities , my legal status as Desdemona's husband , and my innocence will protect me .
Don't say anything else .
lain .
We're absolutely not here to delight you .
I was bound to him an hour ago , sir , but thankfully he chewed through our ropes .
Draw your trustworthy sword , which you have used in such service to your country .
Then meet me right away at the notary's .
We'll start a fire .
Madam , what should I do ?
That ?
Perhaps What , my love ?
I hope you both get drenched with a dew as evil as what my mother used to collect with a crow's feather from the poison swamps .
Am I to be dictated to , like a child ?
And I was just going to yours .
Go to the tomb of your great-grandfather , from whom your own title to the crown derives .
I've seen you bait and mock this man more than once .
Yes , and more .
I will not live to hear the news from England .
She blushes from guilt , not modesty .
If he asks to see me , tell him I'm sick and went to bed .
You are only a soldier .
Did he express any dissatisfaction with you , either in his words or his face ?
Your two sons ?
Mistress , I swear on my life that it's true .
A piece of ice .
His insane period is over .
And it's too bad , Brutus , that you don't have any mirrors that could display your hidden excellence to yourself .
Let the world collapse around us .
Hurry !
If you were king , we would do the same .
Look how lush and healthy the grass is !
Ah , but I know you .
You didn't do anything else to earn this punishment ?
Have her send it to me .
Death is the best way to cover over her shame .
Didn't I meet up with your allies ?
Let me shake your hand .
Yes , gentle cousin , if it were light enough for you .
It's always like this in times of change .
That's not in her favor .
You may as well try to turn the sun to ice by fanning its face with a peacock feather .
Will you have dinner with me tonight , Casca ?
Please give me that .
Why would they do that , my lord ?
Thank you .
This speech is going on too long .
No , it's true , or if it's not , I'm a villain .
Oh , help me , anyone who wants to live long !
Queen , you knew very well that my heart was tied to your ship and that you would pull me along with you .
Even if she's ugly , she'll be smart enough to find a guy to sleep with her .
Well , Brutus , you're noble .
It is , my lord .
I think he must have turned into an animal , because I can't find him anywhere looking like a man .
Go back with her ?
Ah , poor ghost !
Now she's gone forever. , Cordelia , Cordelia , stay a while .
There must be some resolution .
Besides , they act as outward consciences and preachers to us all , a visible reminder that we should prepare ourselves for death .
You think you can get rid of me that easily ?
Believe me , then , that I have special powers .
I'll speak to them , and then tonight I'll get them all so drunk that the wine seeps out of their old war wounds .
Come along , though .
Let rivers flood and fiends howl for food !
This looks like an abbey .
No , definitely not !
Bless you , fair lady !
Come here , Sir Seacole .
Horatio , you're the best man I've ever known .
Pronounce them , it is just as nice to say .
Where are you , Death ?
The Bishop of Ely has fled to Richmond , and Buckingham , backed by a hardy Welsh army , is on the march .
You say the king is losing his mind .
Now I go , a jolly , thriving wooer , to marry my brother Edward's young daughter , Elizabeth , because I know Richmond has his eye on her .
Tell me anything you remember .
Should we just get down to it ?
You are completely wrong about this king .
Give me your hand .
Please stay below deck , sir .
If you're lying , I'll hang you alive from the nearest tree until you die of hunger .
You're going to ask me why I'd rather have a pound of decaying flesh than three thousand ducats .
For the enemy , see , and you can explain this to the duke , see , has dug its own tunnels four yards below ours .
You're a fool .
Don't delay .
Oh , well .
Me too .
Now , no more questions .
Tell us , Bottom .
But since Laertes is better , we've given him a handicap .
How did you learn about this ?
They're as opposite as hot and cold .
Which of us are you referring to ?
Hey , let's have some music here !
Let's go to him .
Hermia is lucky , wherever she is , because she has beautiful eyes .
Are you lovebirds only starting to pair up now ?
The Turks are heading for Cyprus with a powerful fleet .
Yes , I do .
I'll give the first one , Pompey .
An honest guy who's as poor as the king .
I sense you're treating me like a child .
I'll go with you .
Shall we go watch this wrestling , cousin ?
Why , sir , he's not coming .
Do tell .
We can all go together .
Don't worry , man , I won't try to escape .
Well , I'm sorry for your niece .
We came here to fight against you .
If the job had been painful , I would not have come .
Here , stand behind this wall ; he'll come right away .
For now , don't try to persuade me anymore , I ask you as a friend .
Was a man ever so tired ?
She'll fall madly in love with the first thing she sees when she wakes up , even if it's a lion , a bear , a wolf , a bull , a monkey , or an ape .
I beg your pardon for loving you too much .
I'll rest here .
Say I will love her everlastingly .
Bathe his filthy head with warm , scented water .
Iago has kept his word .
Give me details .
It's , But he's drowned , and these guys are devils .
I'm afraid that may be the case , madam .
Be my witness , oh you blessed moon .
You hit my servants , and your disorderly mob of knights treat their superiors like servants .
Sit down , Clitus .
Since Cleopatra died , I have lived in such dishonor that the gods despise my disgrace .
You mock an ancient tradition , born of reverence and worn in honor of brave men who have died , and then have the gall not to stand by your words .
I am sure , sweet Kate , this kindness deserves thanks .
Let me go with you to Belmont .
No doubt , for you wear too many in the first place , and it might be more seemly to make do with fewer .
If I break the door down , slave , you'll be sorry for this .
No , not at all .
Come here , captain .
Why did you leave your wife and child vulnerable , the most precious things in your life , those strong bonds of love ?
Don't be shy , shake hands with me .
Where is that poor rash man ?
Are you in your right mind ?
Did he cry ?
Then , like prophets , they named him the father to a line of kings .
I can't promise that love won't transform me , but I can promise you this : until I truly fall in love , a woman will never make me act like such a fool .
Let's be disciplined and not delay , because tomorrow is a busy day .
But go away now .
There I'll see only myself .
Sit down and eat , and welcome to our table .
What , are we playing with interjections ?
He will , sir , if He wants to .
Some of them give me money , some invite me places , some thank me for the kind things I've done for them , some try to sell me things .
Give me a cup of wine .
But no more spooky visions ! , Where are the messengers ?
Unnatural acts will cause Good night , good doctor .
Oh , if only my smiles could inspire love as effectively as your frowns !
Good-bye !
Well , but what time is it ?
Do you have to harp on my inadequacy ?
I willingly accept your offer and put my future in your hands .
He speaks bluntly , madam .
By risking the second arrow , I'd often get both of them back .
Why only a few courtiers , my lord of Buckingham ?
If you're Trinculo , then come out .
She's insistent .
Look , here I have Macbeth's cursed head .
For you to do it would be good service .
Here he comes , my lord .
Menas , I'm not going back on shore .
I don't know what to say .
That's all I wanted to know .
Don't let him leave out the color of her hair .
On top of her ?
Right .
Death and damnation !
I won't bother with it .
I'm afraid the people have made Caesar their king .
There , take that , you scoundrel !
But I'll go out of spite , to feed off the wasteful Christian. , Jessica , my girl , watch the house .
I'll wear a big sword in my belt , carry a boar-spear in my hand , and hide all my womanish fear in my heart .
I won't stand for it .
I'm glad about that .
Run to your houses , fall on your knees , and pray to the gods to spare you the pain that you deserve for such ingratitude .
Give me Bianca for my inheritance .
justice will be rewarded .
And I understand perfectly his sneering reference to my wilder days .
He's furious because she stole an adorable boy from an Indian king .
Oh righteous God , how can I thank you enough that this meat-eating mutt preys on his mother's children and forces her to join others in their grief !
He's dressed like a freak , a total freak , and not at all like a proper footman or a gentleman's valet .
Goodbye , goodbye .
Think about it .
But I could see that Cupid's fiery arrow was put out by watery , virginal moonbeams , so the royal virgin continued her virginal thoughts without being interrupted by thoughts of love .
I don't really understand what you mean .
I am resolved , to let him live .
Please , one of you go ask that man over there if we can buy some food off him .
Yes , what about it ?
What color , madam ?
By Isis , I'll give you bloody teeth if you ever compare Caesar with Antony , my best man among men .
A friend .
That's what I thought too , sir .
Would your Honor like to try this dried fruit ?
Lucius !
If I don't love her , I'm completely
Why have your rosy cheeks faded so quickly ?
Good Mr. Peaseblossom , I'd like to get to know you better too. , And you , may I ask what your name is , sir ?
Will we hear from you before bedtime , Catesby ?
What is it , Agrippa ?
Whichever hand literally stabbed their tender hearts , you're the one who gave the order .
What else ?
The name suits your fierceness .
Let's do that .
And the poor old man just wept , mixing his tears with the rain .
No , if you struggle with me , Just half an hour !
Let me tell
Oh , wait , sir .
Beautifully , sir , beautifully !
Not now , my sweet Desdemona .
Go inside yourself .
She's full of good intentions .
I'm glad you've come , father .
Those are her orders .
Come this way , my lord .
You and I , and honest Casca , we have epilepsy , we've fallen .
This was the basket .
With his natural luck , he will beat you even against the odds .
You're too forgiving .
Leave me alone .
This harms my reputation .
Know the glove !
Listen , boy !
Tell your wife to watch her .
Well , do whatever you think best .
Morning's here .
Give me your arm .
Do you really think there's a man fool enough to marry into hell , however rich the father is ?
I must go and continue the business Fulvia started .
We want to hear it , Antony .
What if a fellow were bringing him a couple of hundred pounds to toss around ?
Then the writer imitated the one I composed to my steed , for my horse is my mistress .
My wife was killed too ?
Why , are we turning to men ?
If his cause is wrong , our obedience to the king clears us of responsibility for it .
Now he denies it a bit , and tries to laugh it off .
He has no friends except those who are too afraid to defy him .
Can I have a word with you privately ?
Nothing , good sir , except to help Sir Cobweb scratch my head .
And the one who commands us is our king .
That was no show .
Stinking like a swamp .
She says she thinks this is a prank .
He's not very tall , but he's tall enough for his age .
At least I've got some booze to comfort me .
I'm not drunk .
It's too frightened to look at itself .
Not if you go away , there isn't .
What he just said to me , it's alright .
I will , my lord .
So is my horse , Octavius , and for that reason I give him all the hay he wants .
Are Englishmen really such heavy drinkers ?
Didn't I ?
No , instead I'll go to Benedick and advise him to fight his emotions .
God bless you .
On , on , on , on , on !
You mean you don't even want to hear my side ?
There he is !
By God , your doors were locked and you were shut out .
Won't King Richard let me speak with him ?
But fire also gives off light , and fire will burn you .
Tell me , are you and Ensign Pistol friends again yet ?
Sir John Falstaff .
Isn't that enough ?
Do you hear us , sir ?
You and your fellow spirits did your last assignment well , and now I need your help again .
I'll bring you to him .
By our beards ( if we had them ) , you are a knave .
I don't have a talent for putting my heart's feelings into words .
Is the visor of my helmet working better now ?
Yes , right away .
Love cools off , friendships break up , and brothers become enemies .
Well , then , I thank you , though I'm such a beggar that even my thanks are not worth much .
Stay where you are .
What ?
Oh , what a wonderful new world , that has such people in it !
He who chooses me will get as much as he deserves." As much as he deserves , wait a minute there , Morocco , and consider your own value with a level head .
My spirit has been as proud as each of yours , my courage as great , and my reason perhaps even better suited to bandy words back and forth and exchange frown for frown .
Therefore , great king , we surrender our town and lives to your kind mercy .
He had no patience .
And bring the ship's captain to the castle .
No rescue for me ?
Here is the cap your Worship ordered .
Angelo , the jeweler .
Surrender , dog !
Take your seat .
Take three times your money .
A servant told me the night-watchmen saw horrid sights too , but different ones from what we heard and saw .
Now , Antony , our prayers have been answered .
But not in heaven .
Mine too. , Are you listening , monster ?
But sir , there is no such house , no such maid , and no such men as you have dreamed up , like a certain Stephen Sly and one old John Naps of Greece , a Peter Turph , one "Henry Pimpernell , " and twenty more men of this sort , who never actually existed .
How dare I ?
Everybody may do as they please until seven o'clock tonight .
The same liquor that quenched their thirst has fired me up .
And you won't until the needy eat .
But this would be too cold a place to sleep if he hadn't warmed himself with ale .
The king is insane .
I'm here .
So give me your answer , and we'll shake on it .
Yes , we should get his support , for his mature presence will make others think well of us and speak out in support of our actions .
They're ready whenever you are .
Oh , I've heard him talk about that brother , and he described him as the most inhumane man alive .
One creditor showed me a ring he got from your daughter in exchange for a monkey .
Be quiet !
I overheard him and his plans .
What performances have been prepared ?
Am I a coward ?
What should I call you when you're a man ?
I'll wait for you in your cave , where you can tell me what you need from me .
This is how they do it , sir : they measure the depth of the Nile , according to certain marks made on the walls of the Pyramid .
Your husband's mad , isn't he ?
We shouldn't expect men to be perfect , or for them to be as polite as on the weddingday .
He swore that he'd never get married , but now , despite his earlier protestations , he loves ungrudgingly .
Let's see .
Freedom !
Oh , heavenly mixture !
Indeed , the French can bet twenty French crowns to one that they'll beat us , they have such an army .
Come , mistress Kate , I'll join you .
In the end I left them standing in the smelly pond behind your room , with the stinking water covering them up to their chins .
Go away and let me die .
You gave money to me ?
Thank the lord for alliances !
Alright , then I'll see you at Philippi .
I'd be just as happy if you broke his neck as his finger .
Pompey , you can not frighten us with your navy .
Don't give it away .
Yes , my lord .
Now in the factory of thought , create the image of all London pouring forth into the streets .
I don't know what you and other men think of this life , but as for me , I'd rather not live at all than live to worship a man as ordinary as myself .
These are ugly antics .
Don't waste any time .
Pass the order along .
The dirt of a grave must cover your sweet eyes !
That's enough .
And when she is peevish and perverse , sullen , sour , and disobedient to his honest wishes , what is she but a loathsome , warlike rebel and an ungrateful traitor to her loving lord ?
Let this anger sharpen your sword .
The last thing he did before sending me off , dear Queen , was to kiss , the last of many such kisses , this Indian pearl for you .
I need to get Othello's things from the ship .
Come , Kate , let's go to bed .
This is exactly how she always looks , and , I swear it , she is fast asleep .
But will it be soon ?
Please , just look over there .
He took aim at a beautiful young virgin who was sitting on a throne in the western part of the world , and he shot his arrow of love well enough to have pierced a hundred thousand hearts .
Good. , Now come , Ariel !
May the god of power make me , the weakest of the weak , your mediator .
Let me be your servant .
Why are our bodies soft and weak and smooth , unfit for toil and trouble in the world , if not so that our soft qualities and our hearts should agree with our external parts ?
That's very true , mangy rascal , when it pleases God .
Why are you leading these men through the streets ?
Because it doesn't have eight ?
Thirty ships .
The Moor is being tricked by some crook , some terrible villain , some rotten bastard .
He drinks like this every night before he goes to sleep .
Who's closest to him ?
Isn't it completely moral to kill him now with this sword , and an easy conscience ?
What do you mean , lady ?
If you aren't weeping , it's a good sign that I'll soon have a new father .
Then certain ones .
Let me try : If there's a buck who needs a doe Tell him Rosalind will do .
I'll ask them .
When grown-ups teach little children , they do it gently and easily .
Where's Monsieur Cobweb ?
Good news , friends .
It used to be that when you knocked a man's brains out he would just die , and that would be it .
Come on .
I'll go and coach them .
Clarence has arrived , lying , cowardly I'm not surprised it scared you , my lord .
I will , in other words , kill you in three hundred and fifty ways .
What is this news about ?
If they do this , as they will , God willing , my ransom will soon be raised .
She can't possibly have done you any wrong .
Bloody , inhuman villain !
That's "Ninus's grave , " man .
Well , if you were never at court , you were never exposed to good manners ; if you never witnessed good manners , your manners must be wicked ; wickedness is a sin , and committing sins leads to damnation .
She says that you should come to her .
Thank you for all your efforts .
No , I don't .
Let me at him .
That day will never come .
Nothing else , for God's sake !
But brother Anthony , Don't , it's no big deal .
It's strange that you haven't heard .
She creeps along .
How goes it , friend Eros ?
Maud , Bridget , Marian , Ciceley , Gillian , Ginn !
Has there ever been a time , I'd really like to know , when I've definitely said something was true , and it turned out not to be true ?
Madam , please be patient .
Oh God of battles , bolster my soldiers ' courage .
What does Caesar want ?
I don't think he wants to be anywhere but where he is .
I wish you'd never met him .
Oh , please be quiet .
I won't lodge any more than that under my roof .
Relax , gentlemen .
I only partly believe it , for I'm enthusiastic and resolved to meet all dangers without wavering .
Give me my armor .
Amen to that !
If you meet the Prince in the night , you can order him to stop .
No , my good lord .
By this token , you'll be admitted to their cell .
When all these extraordinary things happen at once , we shouldn't say , "These happenings can be explained rationally .
For the same thing .
Take this garment , put it on , and then come back here .
The Prince has made the match , and may God bless it .
Yes , my lord .
Are you done yet ?
What's this ?
If you don't want to , then good riddance .
Let's do it with no show of anxiety , no , with no more fear than if we'd heard that the English were busying themselves with folk dancing .
What are these things we're looking at , my lord Antonio ?
Let's give them room .
He has come to kill my heart .
No , not at all , All right , all right .
Oh , goodbye to my peace of mind !
I'm as good a gentleman as the emperor .
But who are you ?
Yes , God be praised , I have managed to earn his favor .
Yes , return and tell me if your master looks well , because he was sick when he left .
Good to see you , Iago .
I have it on me here .
Excuse me , young man , how do I get to the Jew's residence ?
His nurse ?
I hid under this monster's cloak to get out of the storm .
It's good you found me .
Absolutely , he is stuffed , like a dummy .
Yes , that's for sure .
You are nothing like Mark Antony !
Yes , Caesar , but it's not gone yet .
The king rode out alone to view their troops .
Portia , what are you doing awake ?
We shouldn't make any judgments until we achieve our goal .
Why are you so sad ?
Don't take too long , unless you want our king to come after me to ask what's holding things up , because he's already landed here .
Has it been a quiet night ?
How can it seem like I'm making fun of you , when my tears prove that I'm sincere ?
But I'm not dying yet !
The Hero that died !
of her father .
But he says he still loves and respects you , and based on his own feelings alone he's looking for an opportunity to safely take you back .
Do you lie so low ?
Is Signior Lucentio at home , sir ?
Oh , they continually urged the king to do it .
Once , on a cold and windy day , when the river Tiber was crashing against its banks , Caesar said to me , "Cassius , I dare you to jump into this rough water with me and swim to that point there." As soon as he spoke , though I was fully dressed , I plunged in and called for him to follow .
Alas , grim death , how vile and ugly your near-twin , sleep , is !
It's coming toward me .
It would be excellent if they could make a man halfway between Don John and Benedick .
Take him to my sleeping area .
When did I Do you know where you are , sir ?
I'll do the best I can , my lord .
My husband lost his life to get the crown , and my sons ' fortunes have been tossed up and down , leaving me to rejoice over their victories and weep over their losses .
Then make a circle around Caesar's corpse , and let me show you the man who made this will .
That's really the best way to win the Moor back again .
The marshal of France , Monsieur la Far .
Yes , Casca .
Pardon , dear father .
I'll follow you , my lord .
Another hit .
His letter will tell you how he's doing .
Once he's carried our treasure where we want it , we'll free him of the load and turn him loose like a jackass , to shake his ears and graze in the public pastures .
You will .
If you want to make me happy , don't wish yourself harm .
We'll leave tonight and be home a day before our husbands get back .
What can we do to find out if it's true ?
Darling Kate !
Here he comes .
No , taking you away from your new marriage would be like showing a child a new coat and then not letting him wear it .
No doubt , my lord .
Yes , that's the one .
A greater gift ?
Good-bye , my lord .
Welcome , my lord .
Clink your cups together in a toast !
Age won't wither her , and her charms are so varied that she never grows boring .
I've already slept , my lord .
What's up , Grumio ?
The harvest comes shortly after that .
Did you speak to him ?
Even more since you annexed my father's house and lands .
No one else would .
Like that .
So what if I killed her husband and her father ?
He's dead .
But major issues must come before minor ones .
I would have thrown away all other considerations and made her my wife .
Excellent , very good .
I swear to you by Rosalind's own pretty hand that I am that unfortunate man .
That must mean a sword .
It'll be my job to talk about how Benedick is sick with love for Beatrice .
I could imagine he's divine , since I never saw anything so noble-looking on earth before .
Oh , what an excellent young man !
All right , have it your way .
Yes , my lord .
A man named Taurus , they say .
But I beg your pardon .
I'm not who I appear to be .
I'm so sorry .
So now Sweno , the Norwegian king , wants a treaty .
Yes , he knew about it the whole time .
My noble lords and relatives , good morning .
Poor Harry of England !
I'd rather see you having fun , because we have friends coming who want to have fun .
Well , I'm going to break in .
Oh , that arrow was well shot .
Why Dover ?
So then the Poles won't be willing to defend it .
Do you remember anyone who died of it ?
Informed them" ?
You are welcome here , sister .
Lord Alexas , sweet Alexas , most anything Alexas , almost the most consummate Alexas , where's the fortuneteller you recommended so highly to the Queen ?
Spirit , did you carry out the storm just as I ordered ?
It's too much .
She would hang on to him , and the more she was with him the more she wanted to be with him ; she couldn't get enough of him .
You'll find us both at Crosby Place .
Oh , a plague has been prevented , thank God !
They say Gloucester's bastard son is .
He rests tonight within twenty-one miles of Rome .
No , he means you'll use makeup when you're old .
Can't you talk ?
Monster , use your fingers .
I want you there and back again before I can even tell you what you should do there .
And when he laughs , Othello will go crazy .
Remember me .

Bring in more wine !
Let the Egyptians and Phoenicians go swimming .
It's midnight .
And I have met a gentleman who promises to help me find a good music tutor to instruct our lady love .
Please don't cry .
What do you say , Caesar ?
The rain , the wind , the thunder and lightning are not my daughters .
What color is her hair ?
Hot , hot and moist .
Me too .
Now they've turned around and are clearly heading for Cyprus .
We're not getting any younger .
Why are you doing this ?
I should have reprimanded you then for not bringing it , but you started fighting with me first .
Why , a bad action is just a wrong in this world , but when you've won the whole world , it's a wrong in your own world , so you can make it right then .
No .
They swore that you were sick with love for me .
It will likely be a bloody fight .
Ride to Salisbury .
Her father loved me and used to invite me to his house often , continually asking me about my life and all the battles I've fought .
This is his second fit like this .
My dear friends , thanks for your patience .
I don't know , madam .
Who's that ?
Here , my lord .
You bastard !
You couldn't see him , but I could .
Get out of my sight , or I'll give you what you deserve and spoil Caesar's victory .
I lent my body once to make him rich .
He has called for his horse , but I don't know where he's headed .
My husband .
Ever since Venus and her blind son plotted a way for the god of the underworld to steal my daughter away for half the year , I swore I'd never speak to them again .
And if it doesn't go well , then you can keep her hidden in a nunnery , the best place for someone with her kind of dirtied reputation , away from the public's eyes , tongues , mind , and insults .
Protect me , my friends .
Let me wrap up your head , and it will feel okay in less than an hour .
If we lose , what do you plan to do ?
Doesn't that make you want to cry ?
Why would you celebrate it ?
Let go of it !
As you please .
It's him , it's him .
I recognize his trumpet .
Brave Iago , how honest and trustworthy you are !
Isn't that him on the ground ?
You want me to copy the embroidery pattern ?
Come on .
You can't blame anyone for it anyone , I say .
I'm glad Casca is with us .
He meant he did nothing right for me , which is true , unfortunately .
The moon looks sad to me .
Who here is so barbarous that he doesn't want to be a Roman ?
Even if you were as handsome as I beg your highness' pardon .
Lord Hastings , you and he are close .
Everyone .
I think it's my bad eyesight that's making me see this horrible vision .
It was I , in fact , whom you promised to strike .
Didn't great Caesar bleed for the sake of justice ?
He must be wearing this crazy outfit for some reason .
I'll be nice to him .
We don't have any music that can't be heard .
Is it out of lust ?
I laugh at any weapon used by a man who was born from a woman .
Edward's healing touch is a miracle that I have seen him perform many times during my stay in England .
He's waiting nearby to find out if you'll invite him in .
Go ahead , you fool .
His life was gentle , and the elements mixed so well in him that Nature might stand up and say to all the world , "This was a man." Let's treat him according to his virtue , with all the respect and rituals of burial .
He had his helmet visor up .
I never knew a woman who loved a man so much .
That since she's mad herself , she's married a madman .
Well , we've missed the beginning ; it's dead and buried .
I'm to blame for making you wait for me .
No , he's in a place worse than hell .
What you're doing is the way to make her scorn you continually .
I'll be right here , silent .
You're making fun of me .
Here .
Tell me what you've done with the money I entrusted to you .
Just send him here , and I'll persuade him .
How tall is she ?
So I welcome this wind freely .
Catesby , fly to the duke .
I don't make fortunes ; I only see them .
I can't believe you're my son .
Oh , good judge !
But if the cause is not just , the king himself will have a lot to answer for , when all those legs and arms and heads chopped off in battle shall join together on Judgment Day crying , "We died at such and such a place." Some will be swearing , some crying for a surgeon , some for the wives that are destitute without them , some about the debts they owed , some for their children left unprovided for .
I should always be wise .
If he's as good as a saint but is black like a devil , I'd rather he hear my confession than marry me .
For God's sake , sir , you've been robbed .
Did you call , my lord ?
Many of you own slaves , which , like your donkeys and dogs and mules , you use to perform awful jobs just because you bought them .
There's something else to be done .
Not that I know of .
I know it's the sun that shines so bright .
Oh , Kent , what could I ever do to become as good as you are ?
We'll chase 'em into their latrines .
But please , forgive me , your highness .
What is making our eyes and ears act so strangely ?
The priest is already there .
Listen to many people , but talk to few .
More than anything else in the world , I love you , value you , and honor you .
It's my exercise time .
His courage is hidden , and when it is revealed , it will shrink .
Oh , that's pathetic !
Now die , die , die , die , die .
He's at the duke's morning and night , accusing the state of harming free trade if they deny him justice .
What's that noise ?
And let no one suffer for this deed except us , the perpetrators .
Therefore , when he has reason to fear , as we do , his fears are without question of the same order .
I know the real reason .
We know each other's faces , but as for our thoughts , he doesn't know any more about my thinking than I do about yours or his , or you do about mine .
Get him , he's a thief !
Come talk to me about this .
Yes , sir , he's here at the door right now and asks to see you .
Someone who was always near you .
Don't ask me what I know .
I'll read it to you .
That'll happen soon enough .
Oh , most bloody sight !
Whip him !
Don't worry , Baptista , you'll be perfectly satisfied .
Live , Brutus !
If we meet Macbeth's army tonight , let us be beaten if we can not fight .
Oh , you stupid Moor !
I might do something I'll be sorry for .
Please , write down "Borachio." , And yours ?
Can we finish our lunch ?
He's having dinner tonight with a prostitute , and I'll go visit him .
That's true .
Have my brother-in-law's troops been mobilized ?
If he has my father's love , then that's enough honor for me .
And I am your Rosalind .
Give her this key , and tell her that there's money in the desk that's covered with a Turkish tapestry .
Tyrant , show your face !
They have their exits and their entrances , and in his lifetime a man will play many parts , his life separated into seven acts .
My story does raise that question .
If I said something , she'd mock me so mercilessly that I'd probably disintegrate into air .
Just remember that he is Caesar .
So all the work that oxen and farmers have done in plowing the fields has been for nothing , because the unripe grain has rotted before it was ripe .
Our arms , which can be strong and cruel , and our hearts , filled with brotherly love , embrace you with kind love , good thoughts , and reverence .
I wish them all safe trips home .
All I'm saying is that strange things have been going on .
Tonight let's have plenty to eat .
Well , then , we're awake .
They're never jealous for a reason ; they're just jealous .
I could find it in my heart to beat him , Come on , kiss my feet .
And you saw how the beggar ran from the mutt ?
Octavius , lead your forces slowly out to the left side of the level field .
No .
You said those exact things to me back in the marketplace .
He's my prisoner and you can't have him .
I admit the cape .
My lord , please go inside here .
But why do you keep me here so long ?
We'll give you an answer tomorrow .
The wide ocean doesn't prevent them from coming to see her , they travel across it as if it were a little stream .
Listen !
Guard them carefully until we decide how to punish them .
Your ghost walks the earth and turns our swords toward our own stomachs .
The poison is as sweet as balm , as soft as air , as gentle , Oh , Antony ! , No , I'll take you too .
What is , my lord ?
I'm in a mood to beat you up pretty good .
Your Majesty , see here , if it won't offend your Grace , what a complete , rascally , beggarly , lousy rat this is .
Sir , sir , sir ,
Hey , what's this , Adam ?
Let the envoy from Antony come in .
Why , wouldn't you ?
For God's sake , find a house to duck into .
Isn't it strange ?
No one's listening to you .
Quick , quick .
I'm begging you , tell me who it is quickly , and speak fast .
My dearest sister !
You're going to rest while you're still damned ?
She weeps for Edward and so do I , while she does not weep for Clarence , though I do .
Who knows what the Lord Protector thinks ?
Your cheeks are too flushed for me to believe that was a fake faint .
If they refuse to come , get physical , use a whip if you have to , but get them out here to their husbands .
Oh , but she'll keep her word .
That's how things should be , straight and smooth .
He's not jealous ?
I owe you nothing until I receive the necklace .
That's not fair .
Look , sir , here it comes !
It's the death of half the world .
Yeah , so ?
He'll grow up to be a proper man .
I will go lose myself , wandering up and down throughout the city .
Well , thank God I'm cured !
But only hint at this vaguely , because , as you know , my mother's still alive .
When it comes to defense , it's best to assume that the enemy is more powerful than he seems .
I make the laws , not you .
shifts , friends , to Southampton .
That's me you're talking about , the playful wanderer of the night .
Are your men searching for him ?
It's a monster !
How do you mean , "conspired" ?
But with you it's different .
Because he's daring us to do it .
By this sword , I will .
It's new to you .
Is this true ?
Good point , Decius .
Mark Antony , should we give the signal to attack ?
John Duke of Norfolk , Walter Lord Ferrers , Sir Robert Brakenbury , and Sir William Brandon .
The ghost is definitely something to worry about .
I'll meet it if it's the last thing I do .
You're both wrong .
I'm afraid it will I'd love it .
There is an emergency I must take care of , but my whole heart will remain here with you .
This song's about my dead father .
Where do you live , pretty young man ?
Will you cry ?
I wonder if you'd be so good , you lousy , rotten villain , to grant my wish and my request and gratify me , see , by eating this leek .
Let's have explicit contracts drawn up to ensure that both sides keep their promises .
I haven't seen anything .
What do you say , Signior Gremio ?
You pretty lovers are lucky you met me here .
The king's a dear boy with a heart of gold , he's a lively lad , a wag , born of fine parents , good with his fists .
Another thing , Domitius : Antony wants to see you now .
This is a horrible sight .
If you're my friend , tell me what you're thinking .
Now , Iras , what do you think ?
Oh , oh , oh !
You can't mean what you're saying .
If there's anyone in this assembly , any dear friend of Caesar's , I say to him that my love for Caesar was no less than his .
When I fell in love with Othello I made up my mind that I wanted to live with him .
Show us the way , sir .
Not from crying .
My lord ?
Sister , calm down .
Why are you calling me "love" ?
Didn't they pass by you ?
I swear , if anyone holds me back , I'll make a ghost of him !
I hope to God I'm proven wrong !
With her , on top of her , however you want to say it .
With the handicap they've given me , I think I'll win .
And Benedick is not the worst husband I can think of .
Help !
I've never heard of that .
All is lost !
Come on , give me your best shot .
I repeat , spread the rumor that Anne , my wife , is sick and likely to die .
I overlooked your request , but I did not deny it .
Every heart in Rome loves and pities you .
Give me the necklace !
He's a traitor .
Is supper ready ?
I intend to be flesh and blood , not airy philosophy , for there has never yet been a philosopher who could endure a toothache patiently , even though they all write as if they had risen above human suffering and misfortune .
Why are you so far from home ?
Mercy , mercy !
He cried out , "Wait for me , dear cousin .
Pray you sit still .
But as for this ring , please excuse me .
He's welcome too .
He's going after a young widow .
To kill the boys with the luggage !
I'm Trinculo , don't be scared , your good friend Trinculo .
In that case it's like the words of an unpaid lawyer .
And here he is .
Who are they following ?
Did you say Caesar fainted ?
Well , sir , it's better to say little than to be tedious .
I will choose this one and try my chances .
I regret not observing him more closely before I told you to do that .
But please , father , the question is still nagging at me , why did you conjure up this storm ?
Then I beat my drum , at which point they pricked up their ears and opened their eyes , looking around for the source of my music .
I'm off to Venice to buy outfits for the wedding .
It's a very sad day .
You annoying idiot , what Epidamnum ship is waiting for me ?
I didn't hear anything .
That's what you'll say once you've seen part two .
Cry , "whoa ! " to your tongue , please .
Oh Iago !
Oh , the world never saw a sweeter creature .
So all hail , Macbeth and Banquo !
Not someone who doesn't share that disposition , meaning Mark Antony .
But come on , let's see you do your dance .
Goodbye , my sweet lord. , Goodbye , my sister .
Good-bye , son .
This is all quite pleasant .
Don't attack by land .
They sit chatting by the parlor fire .
I'm glad to hear it .
And so far I'm pleased with the way things have turned out , since I find all of this commotion very entertaining .
My father wasn't a traitor .
It will be hard if "Cambio" loses her .
Let him sink there so the sea will cover him !
Indeed , my lord , the gloomy Jaques grieves over these deaths .
How long do you plan to stay here in this forest ?
I won't pretend to be the devil's porter anymore .
It's time we hit the road .
Listen to my reasons and be silent so you can hear .
I am a gentleman of a company .
Can it be possible that no one saw them leave ?
No , some of it is about my child's father .
It's dangerous out there .
Don't listen to him , Emilia , even though he's your husband .
Thank you , doctor .
Is that how it is , countrymen ?
Duke of Burgundy , if you want peace , the lack of which creates these misfortunes you describe , you must purchase it buy agreeing across-the-board to all our very just demands .
But as far as I can tell , people with too much suffer as much as people with nothing .
Pindarus , order our commanders to lead their charges a little ways away from this ground .
are you going to let them break me out of jail ?
Besides , there's no king , however pure his cause , who , if it comes to a trial by combat , can rely on using completely blameless soldiers .
You're on very good terms with the duke of Exeter .
If this dream vision is typical of what this island conjures up , then I'll lose my son twice .
I went to many places where I heard news about her , but I couldn't find her .
Lady !
No , lieutenant , God , gentlemen , Help , Lieutenant , sir , Montano , Help , men ! , The night guard is coming !
Take a good look , and you'll see that one of the three men who rule the world has turned into a whore's jester .
He'll never agree to that .
Who are these men ?
Come on , can I get you two to make up ?
And he would have deserved it too .
No , I'll go find some ditch to die in .
And didn't they place the wreath of victory on my brow and order me to give it to you ?
Oh , forgive me !
Three times today my horse stumbled and started when he looked in the direction of the Tower , as if he hated to carry me to this slaughterhouse .
I'll drink it if I like .
I shouldn't make you do more than you're able .
Where's that music coming from ?
If you love Rosalind as much as you say you do , you will marry her when your brother marries Aliena .
His most horrible murder .
Lock the doors , my lord .
The young snake that escaped will in time become poisonous and threatening , but for now he has no fangs .
Enough , gentlemen .
If he will grant me conquered Egypt , so that I may give it to my son , I will kneel to him with thanks .
He's had a ship wrecked coming from Tripolis .
But what a fool I am to stand here chatting when I should bid good morning to my bride and seal the bargain with a loving kiss .
Show me .
You won't be seeing anything. , Hold his chair still , men. , I'm going to put my foot on his eyes .
So , goodbye .
To which we all appeal .
Let me see your eyes .
Oh , unfaithful lover !
You tie up horses by their heads , dogs and bears by their necks , monkeys by their waists , and humans by their legs .
What , aren't you a Christian ?
Please don't be offended that I don't want to offend you any more .
Go on , master , and I will follow you , with truth and loyalty to my last breath .
I didn't do anything .
Let me just ask her one question , and by your authority as her father , order her to answer truthfully .
But where will I lie tomorrow ?
No , but Beatrice , Sweet Hero , she's been wronged , she's been slandered , she's been ruined .
But let me hear the letter from your friend .
Heaven commanded Nature To fill her one body With all the graces that women contain .
And you're not suited for any place except hell .
He hadn't arrived by the time we finished eating , so I went out looking for him .
Should we go find Benedick and tell him about Beatrice's love ?
I bet I've been wrong about myself all this time .
Why don't you answer me , man ?
Yes , but I didn't see anything wrong , and I heard every syllable they said .
Yes , that's me .
You got to me first .
Sir , is everyone in your family at home ?
Tell him I am ready to lay my crown at his feet and kneel before him .
I'm starting to lose my mind .
Brutus , what will we do ?
We'll all join hands and sing , and bless this place with our fairy grace .
Your wit is so forceful , it frightens the very meaning out of your words .
Sir , I'm half-blind .
Dearest , kindest , most honorable sir , may I say , with your esteemed approval , which is lit up by the illuminating radiance of the sun-god Phoebus , that , What do you mean by that ?
The world's a liar .
Where is our entertainment director ?
This is not the way to win your daughter .
I hope you have good weather to set your mind at ease .
Our friendship in our schooldays , our childhood innocence ?
My master's decision .
I wouldn't have dared !
Not by the likes of you !
But that would ruin his reputation !
I can be discreet in honorable matters , ride a horse , run , tell a good story badly , and deliver a plain message bluntly .
We're still just beginners when it comes to crime .
Should we watch this ridiculous scene ?
I wish I could believe you that all was well !
My God , it's the same one I gave the judge !
You'll wear a mask , and you can make your voice as high as you want to .
Who pays their way ?
Quiet there !
With patience , noble lord , as prisoners must .
Oh , my poor Rosalind , where will you go ?
There's a farmer here who won't leave without seeing your Highness .
As long as you aren't ashamed to show it , he won't be ashamed to tell you what it means .
You have ruined my innocent child .
You didn't go to sleep , then ?
My son will win .
Regret that your mouth betrayed your actions .
I really think it was him .
The flags have fallen .
Let's not talk about it .
That's terrible !
I think this applause is for some new honors awarded to Caesar .
No , Antony .
She'll find out soon enough by one of our messengers how respectfully and kindly we plan to treat her .
I never gave him any token of romantic love .
Liberty !
It's your turn now .
Look and see .
How can I help you , sir ?
It would be bad if she knew about Benedick's love and teased him about it .
May God bring you sleep !
The gates of mercy will be closed by then , and harsh and hard-hearted soldiers , who have tasted blood , will have free reign to commit whatever violence they want , mowing down your lovely young virgins and budding infants .
I'm going far enough that I'll be riding from now until dinner .
Here's a goat for you .
The old guy .
Are you riding far ?
What if I had a rat in my house , and I felt like paying ten thousand ducats to have it exterminated ?
He laughed at that and let me go .
Why did you leave me alone so unkindly ?
We'll probably witness many more outbursts from him , like banishing Kent .
What's the news ?
No , wait .
Come on , let's all go inside .
What's the news among the merchants ?
Come on , you're fooling yourself .
My lord , you know I'm your friend .
It is , my lord .
Even if we fail at that , we can still fight him on land .
Oh , lovely .
Cleopatra , our conquest won't include either the things you kept back or the ones you listed .
Come here , you .
The gods forbid !
Why do you ask ?
Speak softly .
Let's all sink with the king .
Hold off burying her until I've caught her in my arms once more .
Now , Charmian !
Please forgive me as I forgive you , Hamlet .
My honor wasn't given ; it was only dominated .
He may recover yet .
Cousin , you didn't used to be so thickheaded .
What is your news ?
Where's Metellus Cimber ?
Oh , but I think of him more highly than I say I do , and I wish he looked worse in other women's eyes .
I have walked around the streets , exposing myself to the perilous night , unbuttoned like this , as you see , Casca , baring my chest to the thunderbolt .
We didn't expect Mark Antony to be here .
Listen to me , good Shylock .
Traveling from Sardis , two mighty eagles fell on our front flag and perched there , eating from the hands of the soldiers who'd accompanied us to Philippi .
There are enough of us still alive in the field to overcome the English with our numbers if we could just restore some kind of order .
Tomorrow , while it's still early , I will go see the witches .
Get out of here , good Fleance , run , run , run !
The thane of Cawdor has lost what the noble Macbeth has won .
Believe that you are a foolish little baby for believing these "offers" are something real .
Good night , brother .
Hey , Mountain , hey !
And love doesn't have good judgment either , Cupid , has wings and no eyes , so he's bound to be reckless and hasty .
Where are Lysander and beautiful Hermia ?
Caesar , you're not going to be killed by a traitor , unless you kill yourself..
Then every soldier must kill his prisoners .
I'll give you the title to that ship and its treasure .
So if we know that a man is a thief , should we try to arrest him ?
He thinks that since his fortune is twenty times better than yours , it would be like pitting twenty men against one .
Certainly not !
Excellently , excellently .
Oh , she's a fine woman !
Harder , harder .
How beautiful the moonlight's shining on this bank !
If I can find any animal in this wild forest , I'll either be food for it or bring it as food for you .
Go , go , good countrymen , and to make up for having done wrong , gather up all the poor men like yourselves , lead them to the Tiber , and weep into the river until it overflows its banks .
Away , get out of here .
It carried us toward Corinth-or so we thought .
Is it true , sir , that the Duke of Cornwall was killed as they say ?
The nobleman's are as huge as the underfed villager's .
Be sure to burn his magic books .
Edmund , go find him .
Then a third of the world is drunk .
But mock me gently , dear Kate , because I love you terribly .
Huh !
How could so many people , under two masters , get along under one roof ?
Here's my servant .
Men , wives , and children stare , cry out , and run in the streets as though it were doomsday .
If we meet again , then we'll smile .
It blushes , is easily embarrassed , and stages regular uprisings in a man's heart .
Roderigo !
Tell me so I can be sure , though I swear I recognize your voice .
They swore you did .
Dear master , I can't go any farther .
Stop fooling around .
Our land forces have bravely stood firm .
How many , can you guess ?
Don't come in here , uncle !
I don't trust you .
Since I can't amuse myself by being a lover , I've decided to become a villain .
I was sure that you hadn't given it to me .
Relent , and save your souls .
I'll bring you to him right away .
Oh , listen to me , night , Who is this ?
Just remember to grab his books first , since without them he's just a poor fool like me , and can't command a single spirit .
Let me at her ! .
Sure , but don't do it at full volume until there's no danger in it .
I hope that , after I tell you my news , you will think better of me .
I don't know , madam .
Be as lazy and neglectful as you like around him , you and the other servants .
Who sent you this time ?
Just as Antony loves .
If I have killed your children , I will have children with your daughter .
Give me your present to give to Master Bassanio .
It was urgent and important enough to require his personal presence .
I'm not talking about proof yet .
Go to the gate .
This is what it's all about , Please , I beg you , No , my lord , I'm comfortable like this , thank you .
Farewell , kind master .
What , are you mocking me to my face ?
If our father were dead you'd receive half of his revenue forever , and you'd have my undying love , Edgar." Hmm , what's this , a conspiracy ?
It's come again .
I'll be right next to you .
Has he ever tested out these ideas on you before ?
And when you married him and made him the master of your bed , I gave you my word that I would do everything I possibly could for him .
Madam ?
I agree .
When I reach the place he's calling from , he disappears .
What are you going to do ?
Say welcome to all of our friends for me , sir , for in my heart they are all welcome .
You may , sir .
Thieves !
It's no use !
I believe your Honor is thinking of a character called Soto .
Now , Signior Petruchio , how are you getting on with my daughter ?
Miserable England , I foresee for you the most frightening time you have ever experienced. , Come , lead me to the block .
The weakest fruit drops to the ground first , so let me drop .
We're very sorry , sir , that you may not live to wear us out with your commands .
Honestly , sir , we say that we are not criminals .
Now , Death , you can boast that you have an incomparable girl in your possession .
Yes , but the mustard is probably too hot .
I'll leave now , to set all these things right .
They were villains , murderers .
And so , good-bye .
By eight o'clock .
But it's dangerous to make him try to make sense of the time he lost .
My good lord , I still need you to like me .
So , by heaven's decree , Rosalind Was composed Of different faces , eyes , and hearts , so that she might have the most prized touches of all .
That's it ?
Cleopatra summoned him .
The old king was so overjoyed by this promise that he gave young Fortinbras an annual income of three thousand I like this news , and when I have time I'll read this and think about how to reply .
Besides , they're fresh .
Hurry , hurry !
Here I go .
How did we manage to get ashore ?
Have Lucius and Titinius guard the door .
As for my daughter Katherine , this much I know : she's not for you , more's the pity .
I'll die like a swan .
Please , leave it here .
Where are your leather apron and your ruler ?
I came here to tell you , I'll make this short , since she's already been talked about for too long , the lady is unfaithful .
I just meant that our hearts are joined , so we can almost think of them as one heart .
But you didn't , even though you had every reason .
Bad luck , bad luck ?
When a great person departs , it causes more pain than when the soul leaves the body .
Squabbling ?
As a matter of fact , if the playwright had played Pyramus and hanged himself with Thisbe's belt , it would have been a very good tragedy .
No , please .
Was someone as beautiful as you meant to be a whore ?
I think few die well who die in battle .
How are you , Hero ?
If I were your average fool , or if I made my feelings for you worthless by making the same promises of friendship to everybody , or if you'd seen me first flattering men , hugging them tightly , and later slandering them behind their backs , or if you hear that I drunkenly declare friendship at banquets with all the rabble , only then , of course , go ahead and assume I'm dangerous .
Who brought it out here ?
Bloodshed will force you to .
I assure you , sir , it's true .
But tell me what you're fighting about .
Someone who makes a promise and breaks it .
What , was I married to her in a dream ?
If that's what you say , go fight a duel with me and prove it .
Damn your mistress !
She's beautiful , if my eyes can see .
Your attendant asses are getting the horses ready .
What do you think he wants ?
Close , soft eyes .
Go find those herbs for him , before his madness puts his life in danger .
No , if they try to lead us to harm , I will leave the dance floor at the next song .
The count is neither sad nor sick nor cheerful nor well , he's just civil , as Seville as an orange , with the same jealous-yellow complexion .
It's entirely possible .
If you can love a man of this temperament , Kate , whose face a sunburn wouldn't make any worse and who never looks in the mirror to admire himself , let your eye improve me .
Richard , the duke of Gloucester , hates you .
Good advice , indeed .
I've lost so much weight worrying about my losses have that I'll hardly have a pound of flesh to spare for my bloody creditor tomorrow. , Well , jailer , let's go. , I hope to God that Bassanio comes to see me pay his debt .
Where have you been , sister ?
Maybe , but I wish I'd never laid eyes on him .
I am not a child or an infant .
Meanwhile , I'll make a list of props that we'll need for the play .
Let go of me !
Don't worry about how I handle it .
I await justice .
Don't you suspect my office ?
Honestly , you're speaking the truth , ever since the fools were With his mouth full of news .
Tom's chilly .
Gentlemen , go in there and grab him .
I thought your heart had been wounded by a lion's claws .
What do you think I've got on my head ?
But you had better get back to Egypt again .
Hover about her and tell her she got what she deserved , with her children dead before their time .
That makes you an even bigger villain. , Well , throw him out , and have my officers seize his house and lands .
Your heart's going to break .
You mean an officer ?
The night air is too raw and cold for us to stay outdoors .
On record , my gracious lord .
Look , let's stay here tonight .
It's lovely to see you .
I've done a bad thing , for which I will blame myself so much that I'll never be happy again .
If you lie , boy , we'll have you whipped .
Don't you think so ?
She replied by saying that it would be better for him to be her guest instead .
It's better here than outside .
You're leaving with my tongue in your tail ?
I knew that would be your answer .
Didn't feel like it ?
Women are lucky , then .
Ask it something , Horatio .
Fair sister , will you go with the princes or stay here with me ?
I told him we'll stay for at least a month , and he says that he hopes we'll stay longer .
I can't see ahead of me .
Yes , he was hotheaded even in the prime of his life .
Go home !
Were you ever at court , shepherd ?
For you to threaten to kill me is most unlawful .
Corporal Nym , be a man and put away your sword .
I'd rather be a weed in a hedge than a rose in my brother's garden .
Hello , brother Edmund .
I can't hide what I am .
You're a villain !
Then have your servants bring him out .
I'll find him right away , sir , and carry out the business as well as I can .
Macbeth has come .
She always has to have a light next to her .
The more you joke about it , the more clearly I feel how serious it is !
Now please leave me alone .
Listen to me , Queen .
You know that he does .
Yes , it is .
Who's there , aside from this foul weather ?
She was only dead , my lord , as long as her slander lived .
If he did that , it would be a charitable deed to hang him .
That's where I'm going now , so I'll leave you here .
Come on , come on .
If you like , Brakenbury , you can listen to anything we say .
There'd be no marriage ?
I know the glove is a glove .
If it's work for a man , I'll do it .
The island must be mild , and have a temperate climate .
Demetrius doesn't think so , and that's all that matters .
We'll leave , Brutus .
For no man , sir .
Here , drink to me .
Everything's fine .
Is he dead ?
When you fight against your country's enemies , you will be paid for your efforts with your country's wealth .
Inside , sir , with the earl .
I thought he was just toying with you and meant to ruin your reputation .
Marcus Octavius , Marcus Justeius , Publicola , and Caelius will go by sea , but we'll keep the bulk on land .
I think he's nervous , he's about to become the savage bull who got domesticated .
I'm going inside to think up some way to kill that beautiful devil .
Now , though , in all of Rome , there's room for only one man .
Very clever !
If that's true , he won't get it back by crying .
Can you imagine being hitched to a lump of clay ?
Now that I think about the danger of these knights , if you come to stay with me , please bring no more than twenty-five of them with you .
I wish to God that the golden crown that I'll have to wear were red-hot steel and burned me straight through to the brain !
Your husband .
Madam , oh , good Empress !
Who are you ?
I made you de facto rulers of my kingdom on condition that I could keep a hundred knights of my own .
And yet , words are a good thing when the man speaking them is pleasant to listen to .
We're to be married on Sunday .
She fainted at the sight of them bleeding .
Be brave like the lion and proud .
Well , let me get back to my choice .
I'll ask you another question .
But sir , Be quiet , Kent .
Go ahead , say "Amen." No more talking .
Don't you have any sense at all ?
Arrest him : he's a friend of the duke of Alencon's .
What's keeping you ?
I hope you get what you desire !
The biggest clue is his seriousness .
If you struggle to bring down a tyrant , you will sleep peacefully when the tyrant is killed .
Oh God , whose side I think I'm fighting on , look kindly on my forces .
What a horrible day !
Bring ink and paper , Charmian .
And I hope you realized I wasn't very happy about it .
I'm sorry you're leaving my father like this .
You will pretend to be a schoolmaster and offer to teach the girl .
How strange that they all got so sleepy !
And Cassius too .
My noble king , my friends have informed me that Sir Edward Courtney and his brother , the haughty Bishop of Exeter , are now in My king , the Guildfords in My lord , the duke of Buckingham's army , Enough , you
If God will be revenged for this deed , he will do it publicly .
You can be married tomorrow if you want .
I'd rather overload my liver with wine than starve my heart by denying myself fun .
Your Majesty shall mock at me .
And what did he say ?
Where is he staying ?
Always give him his way .
But Hello , my lord , how have you been doing lately ?
Pardon my crime , sovereign , but not my person .
I'm sure you do .
There must be some political news from Venice , or some dangerous plot here in Cyprus has ruined his good mood .
Where's the gold I gave you ?
Oh , it was a monstrous roar , to make the earth tremble !
Wear both the ring and my heart , because both are yours .
Caesar's speed defies belief .
Swallows have built nests in Cleopatra's sails .
Your wife Octavia , with her self-effacing eyes and self-righteous assumptions , won't get any praise from patronizing me .
He would never have spoken to me like this .
Go , bring him here , boy .
Help us , good friends .
Lay off , already !
Your son is crazy .
No , it'd be a sin to think such a low thought .
If she refuses my proposal , I'll tell her how much I'm looking forward to the announcement and the wedding .
Let it go up to heaven .
You're defending an impostor ?
And after this I'll be good and hope you forgive me .
Antony" was divided between her heart and lips .
I'll tell you at a better time .
Oh , oh , oh !
Get me a surgeon !
I'll do my best , madam .
Menas , I don't understand how minor quarrels can be superseded by greater ones .
What "passion" ?
Are you talking about young Master Launcelot ?
This is not a maiden , as you say , but an old man , wrinkled , faded , and withered .
Come here , you wretch !
Oh , you lowlife !
How awful !
But I made an oath , an oath , an oath in heaven .
Oh , it's horrible , horrible , so horrible !
It is only as high as it is and moves with its own legs .
I'd deny whatever evidence you had against me , even if it were in my own handwriting , and turn it all into evidence against you and your plans for treachery .
He said he did , I don't know .
God be with you .
If I could make things better by lying , I'd deny it .
Oh , no .
In a minute , sir .
Don't be so quick to twist my meaning .
The king has just honored me , and I have earned the good opinion of all sorts of people .
Oh , my old master ! , Who tied him up ?
He accuses me of withholding his share of Sextus Pompeius' possessions , which we seized in Sicily .
I'll have my head cut from my shoulders before I'll see the crown so misplaced .
Good , here's the stretcher .
It's always dangerous when little people get caught in the crossfire of mighty opponents .
Sounds good to us .
I'd rather cut my tongue out of my mouth than say anything bad about Michael Cassio .
Did the brothers-in-law leave ?
Whatever pertains to myself I will deal with last .
Take me to Antony .
Macbeth has heard this news and he is so angry that he's preparing for war .
So get ready to cut off the flesh .
Are there magic spells that can lead young virgins astray ?
Are you going to let us in ?
Not a bit , madam .
Isn't it past two o'clock ?
If I don't do all this , never trust me again .
Stop arguing and listen to my plans .
But I'm sorry I've blurted all this out .
Why are you hiding that letter ?
I hope you'll recognize me when we meet again .
Mister Challenger , the princess wants to speak to you .
That's enough , Dromio , please .
You don't know a thing !
You might as well do the impossible rather than try to soften his Jewish heart .
His mistake was hardly worth punishing him for in the first place , though in wartime it is sometimes necessary to make examples out of even the best soldiers .
joy except my love for you , and I find that only your majesty's love makes me happy .
Be violent , bold , and firm .
Oh , how stupid !
Will you abandon her ?
Come , I'll show you your bridal chamber .
Ha , ha !
It's better to be the person who gets murdered than to be the killer and be tormented with anxiety .
Goodbye , you dumb old spirit .
In suicide , gods allow tyrants to be defeated .
And if he ever has a wife , let her be more miserable when he dies than I am now .
My love , my life , my soul , beautiful Helena !
You can have anything you want .
Indeed , you have wronged me , you liar .
You're a natural-born philosopher !
What , Gertrude ?
But why , why , why ?
He's standing ready outside the door .
Is she as fiery a shrew as they say ?
Well then , your uncle and the Prince and Claudio have been deceived .
Oh , he hasn't ?
It's not friendly , and it's not ladylike .
Of what city , may I ask ?
Every night I'm awakened by his Poor dear , goodbye .
In an instant we were separated from them , as if in a dream , and brought here in a daze .
Is she enclosed in silver , which is ten times less valuable than gold ?
What man is that ?
What's the matter , lieutenant ?
Tell me , do I have your consent to kill them ?
But then I do you wrong to say as much , since you are the very embodiment of bravery .
Not being the worst daughter deserves some praise , I guess .
How are you , madam ?
Are you my daughter ?
Go look for him .
Listen but don't speak to it .
I've been up all night .
What's new , cousin Lodovico ?
How is my noble lord ?
Goodbye .
Oh , I'm dead !
What should I do that I'm not doing ?
So let's see it .
All three of them are crazy with despair .
Yes , I should know , but it disturbs me .
Iago , who started it ?
I've seen you fight and envied your skill .
Excellent .
She shall , Lucentio .
What are you doing ?
You who are wicked beyond belief , the only "explanation" I'll accept from you is for you to hang yourself .
Military music and military rites will speak for his heroic qualities .
That's why I've begged him to come on our shift tonight , so that if the ghost appears he can see what we see and speak to it .
Why not ?
Is the building of your love already in ruins ?
A woman who doesn't know how to make her own indiscretions look like her husband's fault is hardly a woman .
Here I am .
Oh , that's a good wish !
I demand to be satisfied .
It
Hello , sir .
I answered that Lepidus had become too brutal and abused his position .
You have some plea for Caesar , don't you ?
I thought that thing you're talking about was a man .
By Jupiter , if I were Antony , I wouldn't shave my beard today .
His name is Tyrrel , my lord .
Phoebe wrote it .
I can't believe I was scared of him !
Now the time is right for us to speak , and we do so with imperial authority .
His glory has not been diminished where he earned it , nor have those offenses for which he was killed been exaggerated .
I don't know .
The prince has done neither ; therefore , in my opinion , he isn't really protected by sanctuary .
He can hold his fingers in a V-shape like this , and Pyramus and Thisbe can whisper to each other through that little crack .
She will be the bond that joins our kingdoms and our hearts .
And should everyone who makes promises and breaks them be hanged ?
You , constable , are representing the Prince himself .
I am satisfied .
Yes , madam .
That he had sex with you .
There's money in it for you .
My Lord of Oxford , you , Sir William Brandon , and you , Sir Walter Herbert , are going to stay with me .
I want to measure the extent of your love , to see how far it stretches .
You're not really my daughter , but I still have one daughter left .
No more than my staying here in Rome might mean to you in Egypt .
Now , soldiers , advance .
Three thousand ducats for three months , and Antonio will guarantee it .
So good night to everyone .
I could be convinced if I were like you .
But when You take up your duties too cheerfully .
Quiet !
Yes , hand me one too .
Yes , it's true , sir .
If that's true , it's a serious fault , and Caesar has paid seriously for it .
My lord ?
I don't know what to say .
Hail , King of Scotland !
Look at them .
Her heart is carrying a heavy weight .
Dorset , embrace Hastings. , Hastings , express your affection for the marquess of Dorset .
And to me , Denmark is a prison .
Dear Celia , I already look much happier than I feel , but you want me to look even happier ?
Have you heard about Albany's and Cornwall's troops ?
Now let me see if I can translate it .
It is a trade , sir , that I practice with a clear conscience .
Oh , teach me how you look the way you do , and which tricks you used to make Demetrius fall in love with you .
A sleeve ?
You are a remarkable person and your loss is equally remarkable .
Amen .
I sent for Cassio to come talk with you .
Where are you now ?
It's not my fault he acts like that , Helena .
We three are married , but you two are defeated .
I wish there wasn't so much dew on the ground .
Come on , boy .
It warms my heart to encounter such a country bumpkin .
If I can tame him , I'll charge as much as I can get for him .
This contract doesn't give you any blood at all .
If that were true , then I'd know your secret .
But you don't love me .
Neither the sky nor the earth have been quiet tonight .
You see how naive and foolish I've been .
You see me here , gods , a grieving old man , as wretched in his grief as he is in his old age .
Kill me tomorrow , but let me live tonight .
I had a son , whom I've legally disowned .
Is it a weakness ?
I believe it won't stop moving and stand upright till Richard wears the wreath of the realm .
That's true .
You're a villain to say this about me .
No , just help me unpin this .
I'll expect you .
You agreed to send me troops and weapons when I needed them .
You have weapons ?
When I was putting on the Ceres show , I thought of reminding you about Caliban , but I was afraid of upsetting you .
Who are the people who want to speak with me ?
Here's the east .
By St. Paul , ghosts have struck more terror in my soul tonight than ten thousand of worthless Richmond's soldiers could , dressed up in their most sword-proof armor .
Go !
He's the most stubborn dog that ever lived among humans .
Yes , but no doctor can help me .
Risk everything for lead ?
Life is a story told by an idiot , full of noise and emotional disturbance but devoid of meaning .
Then run away .
Titinius is lying face-up .
Or stuff what he says into their pockets .
I won't be taken for a fool who sighs and gives in to Christian meddlers .
Why would she write to Edmund ?
You can command a beggar to bow on bended knee , but can you take possession of his health ?
Let's have the evidence .
It orders me to hand the noble duke of Clarence over to you .
I'll do what I can , more than I'd do for myself .
Your slander has broken her heart , and now she lies buried with her ancestors in a tomb , ancestors who had never been tainted by scandal until you caused one with your wickedness .
No .
I meant a crowbar .
Now it's time to get back to my studying , since I have a lot of serious business to take care of before dinner .
Bring them right in .
I know it .
Silence , then !
Come , ask me to do anything for you .
Why should I now have to make do with only twenty-five ?
When I raise my hand , you do the same , and bring it down on Gonzalo's head .
I'll try to make myself worth your knowledge .
What kind of loyalty is this ?
I know you from before .
Now I say good night to your bones , Hero .
Dear father , if you caused this terrible storm with your magic powers , please put an end to it .
Watch Cassius .
Have your wife attend to her , and bring them along as soon as you can .
What ?
With all of them at once : they work together to create such an entirely evil person that no good ever manages to enter the mix .
However , I'll do what I can for you .
But it doesn't matter .
There she is .
This play isn't right for you .
These past fifteen years you have been living in a dream , and even when you were awake , it was as though you slept .
When she takes a sip , I bob up against her lips and make her spill the drink all over her withered old neck .
If you stick with me , when the time comes , there will be something in it for you .
One criminal punishes another .
Wait !
Now I see that all three of them have gotten together to play this cruel trick on me .
Good Lord !
You got me , I admit it .
It would please him very much if you would rely on his wealth and success to support you .
He's asking him to tell the story again .
We will speak about this further .
What's that good for ?
What were those things ?
Alexas !
Come back to my house with me .
So let's join forces and get revenge .
I've told you .
I did , my lord .
She's a perfect woman , it's true .
You come here with letters against the king , and you take his conceited daughter's side against his royal highness .
Therefore , every soldier should do as any man who is sick in his bed would do : clear his conscience of any stain .
Come on , let's go inside .
It may be , it certainly may be .
I'm sure I can answer for him , he doesn't know any , either .
Yes , my good lord .
Hate it , fear it , do not come inside .
Good sir , calm down .
Your Emperor is still a king among gods .
This is the perfect place to rehearse .
Please , just wait a minute .
Shame on you , get on board !
Keep me balanced and sane .
If I can cure him from his fever and tame him , and get him back to Naples , he'd make a great present for any emperor .
That's completely beside the point .
No , my lord .
God protect you from tornadoes , evil stars , and diseases !
I'll write down what she says , so I'll remember it better .
I hear him .
I , who have survived storms at sea where the winds raged like wild animals ?
Wait , let me hire him too. , Here's my fool's cap , a token of my gratitude .
Then if we lose this battle , you'll be willing to be led in chains through the streets of Rome ?
The total due is about three ducats more than I owe this gentleman .
What's this , you dog ?
Farewell .
That was my turquoise ring !
He'll recover his sanity there .
Oh , I wish I had my rosary !
Why do we party until we're like animals ?
No , there it is again .
Who was that ?
Set fire !
He's his homeland's jewel .
Is it time , my Lord Constable ?
How low we can fall , Horatio .
I met him in the street , he was there with that man .
Do so .
Oh , shut up .
My mind and courage will never falter with doubt or shake with fear .
It's the blessed sun .
Run , run , my lord .
Come with me tonight , and you'll see a man enter her bedroom chamber , even tonight , the night before her wedding .
I should have known it .
He wouldn't say that .
Before I open this letter , please tell me how my good friend is doing .
So please , old friend , give us some good advice .
No , my lord , I didn't see anything .
Let go of him , peasant , or you die !
But if I am myself , then I know for sure that your weeping sister is not my wife .
I was talking to a petitioner here just now , someone who's suffering from your anger .
I'll go get Beatrice for you , who can walk here by herself , she has legs .
And they thought Margaret was Hero ?
Welcome , sir .
Run , my lord , run .
I'll take you and your wonderful virtues here and now , if it's okay that I'm picking up what others have thrown away .
And I know that unless the law intervenes , it'll be bad news for poor Antonio .
The Moor himself is still at sea .
We had a little food and fresh water that a nobleman from Naples , Gonzalo , had given us out of the kindness of his heart .
Young man , excuse me , how do I get to the Jew's ?
We'll rise and leave early tomorrow .
What did Northumberland say about Richmond ?
The king is coming here tonight .
You should ask instead if it's possible that any criminal could be so rich .
Good sir ,
It's time that we brought our armies into the field .
Let's go .
The gods protect him from so great a shame !
I met this man with my glove in his cap , and I have been as good as my word .
No , come back , Kate .
How are you , Hamlet ?
And thus I let you go and give you to the gods .
Let the old ruffian discover that I have many other ways to die , and in the meantime , we'll laugh at his challenge .
Is it possible that any crime could be so valuable ?
What's the matter ?
Wasn't he born from a woman ?
I assure you it is , madam .
Don't sleep so close to me .
Have patience and endure .
Not even trivial things were left out .
Are you planning to go out ?
Thank you for saying that , your Worship , but we're just the poor duke's officers .
My letters say there are a hundred and seven ships .
That's right , or drinking , swearing , fist-fighting , visiting prostitutes , that kind of thing .
It's absurd .
Your love's name is Rosalind ?
Father , take pity on him .
If we welcome our punishment , we punish it right back by seeming to take it lightly .
Will you break my heart ?
Now , I'm very pleased with it being outdoors , but in its not being at the court , it is boring .
Haven't I resisted even Brutus , begging from his knees ?
But a lot of men have more hair than intelligence .
They want to talk .
Damn it !
This is a majestic and harmonious vision .
Die where you have lived , in my arms .
The humiliation that the king is suffering now will be revenged thoroughly .
What a horrible slut !
He's speaking now , or perhaps he's whispering , "Where's my serpent of the Nile ? " For that's his pet name for me .
I think one of them is nearby and can't get away .
Lord , may I never see a day of trouble until the day I let someone treat me like that .
The English army , sir .
Well , take him on up and we'll try to pull it off .
The king is getting up .
Brutus , you give a nice speech along with your evil strokes .
I remember a fight , but not why we were fighting .
You lie .
Your lieutenant , Cassio .
I can't pull a cart or eat dried oats like a horse .
I'll go tell the king about this .
The rest of my life will be nothing but bitterness .
This'll be a wonderful kingdom to live in , where they play music for free .
We killed those men and sent them to rest in peace so that we could gain our own peace .
My ear must pull it out .
You're lucky , my lord , to be able to see the peace and sweetness even in what bad luck has brought you .
I think that's strange .
He's dead .
And here comes father .
Dolabella !
My evidence that you have wronged me is that you condemned and disgraced Lucius Pella for taking bribes here from the Sardinians , and you ignored my letters , where I argued that he was innocent ; I know the man .
We're ready if our minds are ready .
We'll have one heart , one bed , two bodies , and one faithful vow .
Good night , Pompey .
Be happy .
God gives those gifts , I had nothing to do with it .
Don't think I'm in love with him just because I'm asking about him .
Madam wife , they say I've been dreaming or asleep for more than fifteen years .
Sir , I have no future ahead of me .
When it's paid , bring your friend back .
Tear him to pieces .
Rub his temples .
Me , uncle ?
Go around the forest , moving faster than the wind , and make sure you find Helena of Athens. , She's lovesick , and her face is pale from all the sighing she's been doing , because sighing is bad for the blood .
What , here in the middle of the street ?
Go ahead , Moon .
Now , Eros .
Do you know why the nose is in the middle of a person's face ?
Truly , madam , I don't hear anything .
That's worse .
He deserves it , even if it were covered with jewels like holy
Othello isn't any of those things .

Who said that ?
But now we don't have to !
I can make my handwriting look just like Lady Olivia's : she
Do your job .
If this letter falls into your hands , think carefully about what it says .
Why do you hide these things ?
They say he used to fence for the shah of Persia .
You must be mistaking me for someone else , sir .
About as old as you are , my lord .
He's a coward , a total coward .
Like medicine for a sick man .
Who are you ?
Then you really are insane , if you're no saner than a fool .
You won't be wasting your time , because I really can sing and talk to him about many different kinds of music , so he'll be happy to have me in his service .
Challenge the count's young servant to a fight .
Go take care of him .
Let him be the devil if he wants to , I don't care .
It was a total fluke that you yourself were saved .
Madam , there's a young gentleman at the gate who really wants to speak to you .
Hang on a minute , here's some money for you .
The house will be so much quieter .
I tell you , I'm as sane as any man in Illyria .
I wish you all the best .
I wish this trick would be over .
You should be ashamed of yourself , Satan , you liar !
Sir Topas !
Here comes my little bird .
I was never a thief or a pirate , though I admit I was your enemy for good reasons .
If you want things done in the right way , you'll have to let me read a crazy letter in a crazy voice .
I swear to you , I don't want to be doing this .
I'm not a fighter .
How are you , my friend ?
Good , very good .
There was no story , my lord .
I'd say I was "out of my element , " but that phrase is overused , so I'll say I'm "out of my air."
Tell him not to send any more messengers , unless you feel like coming back to tell me how he took the bad news .
What have you heard from her ?
If not , what can you do about it ?
We'll meet at the Elephant .
Absolutely .
Don't ask to see this letter .
Excuse me , sir , do you know anything about this ?
You have to come with me .
I will .
This is the air , that's the glorious sun .
Why not ?
Goodbye .
She's the reason I'm here .
Take him away !
If this is a dream , let me keep on sleeping !
If you've offended him , I'll fight you .
Madam , I've come here to try to make you like him .
Anyone who says that is a lying piece of garbage .
Where is Malvolio ?
Yes , sir , we're part of her entourage .
I told him you were asleep .
Virtue is beauty , but someone beautiful and wicked is like an empty box decorated by the devil .
He's very handsome and speaks well , but he's very young .
No , sir .
I don't think a team of oxen could get them close enough to fight .
The gentleman insists on fighting a round with you , for the sake of his honor .
Oh , hello , father !
And wanted to see you with laces crisscrossed over your legs." Crisscrossed ?
That's a good thing to put in , it keeps you from getting in trouble with the law .
Is it that aggressive ?
What are you saying , mistress ?
By the way , I'm going home tomorrow , Sir Toby .
No , I'll prove it with airtight evidence and logical argument .
What a pretty picture , three fools all together .
What else could you possibly think of me ?
He called me Sebastian .
Be pointed and brief .
Hello , sir !
I'll do everything she wants me to do .
Here's a postscript ! .
Please , sir , be quiet .
He's just as terrified of Sir Andrew .
Sir Topas , Sir Topas , good Sir Topas , please go find my lady Olivia , Get out , demon !
Not old enough to be a man , but not young enough to be a boy .
That's excellent .
A false conclusion .
And some have greatness thrust upon them." Heaven help you !
Mr. Fabian , stay with this gentleman until I come back .
The fact that he serves as a go-between for his lord and my niece Olivia confirms this .
Look , here comes the fool .
Your fate awaits you .
What is fated to happen must happen .
What do you think of this fool , Malvolio ?
When has anyone ever put you down like that .
Are you an actor ?
It doesn't sound as sweet as it did before .
Dear God , thank you !
Oh , you're a clergyman ?
Has your lord given you any orders to negotiate with my face ?
I'm coming , don't worry .
Are you really going to pretend you don't know me now ?
I have to obey .
Ah , I'm an odd kind of guy .
You must have figured out who I am .
Show me the way .
Yes , madam .
Go and wiggle your ears !
Lady Olivia told her servant Malvolio to kick you out of the house .
Yes , it is , I think .
I may command the one I love." Well , she commands me .
Give me your hand , sir .
The count's messenger , Cesario .
He's really taken this prank to heart .
Here , take this piece of jewelry .
This letter's going to turn him into a starry-eyed idiot .
You're wrong , sir , I do care about something .
The police are here .
Then lead the way , father .
Here come the conspirators .
Goodbye .
At your service , madam .
My lord acts just as crazy with love as you do .
This precious little guy is putty in your hands , Sir Toby .
Why are you acting so brazen toward my lady ?
Can someone fall in love this quickly ?
If you're someone who gets into fights , I'll fight with you .
I was born and raised less than three hours from here .
But maybe by some fluke he was saved too .
As for him , I never think about him .
My lady Olivia , your niece , disapproves of your late-night partying .
We've got some words of wisdom to mull over .
Should we sing a round to wake up the night owl ?
You're awfully eager to fight .
Hello , you idiot .
Go after him and try to calm him down a little .
He looks like he just recently stopped breastfeeding .
But you have to .
What ?
Yes , sir .
You're right .
My lord loves you .
M" , Malvolio .
Yes , she saw me quite clearly .
I'd follow you to the gates of Hell , you sneaky little devil !
But I'm still fairly high-ranking .
Well , we all have our special gifts .
No , not at all .
If that's true , which it is , she might as well be in love with a dream , the poor lady .
Get that fool out of here .
Let's go !
It's my master who's not getting the reward he deserves , not me .
Yes , that's the idea .
He'll tell you more of the story .
Would it be better if I were that , instead of what I am ?
I'd hate to waste my speech on the wrong person , because It's very well written and I spent a lot of time and energy memorizing it .
Oh please , go somewhere else to blab your nonsense .
Or maybe there's a chance he didn't drown. , What do you think , sailors ?
Why do you say that ?
That's a lame answer .
Can you do that ?
Please , my lady , just confirm that you're the lady of the house so I can get on with my speech .
She said if she were interested in someone , it would be someone who looked like me .
Are you all crazy ?
Lady Olivia will have you executed for not showing up .
I saw you at Count Orsino's recently .
Can't you talk about anything besides ladies ?
It's too late to go to bed now .
And when he strikes back at you , he'll hit you as sure as you're standing there .
Well then , goodbye .
Madam , Count Orsino's young messenger has returned .
Get him to bed and make sure his wounds are treated .
What do you want ?
Yes , dear little chick , come along with me. , Shut up , man !
I'm surprised you enjoy the company of this stupid troublemaker .
She's a good little woman , and she adores me .
What's wrong with you ?
If that's true , I think the same thing about you .
But I'm still fairly high-ranking .
Ask me any commonsense question .
Where's the passage of holy scripture that you're basing your sermon on ?
Anyway , what should we do ?
Anything that's mended is only patched up .
Wow , we're really going to drive him crazy .
Won't we , Sir Andrew ?
But he'd been there before me , and they told me he'd gone out looking for me .
Come on , take us to him .
I wish you'd do what I ask !
My niece already thinks he's insane .
I'm not interested in being good .
Oh , I'll beat him up for that !
Now , you lie there on the path .
I think his soul's in hell , my lady .
That's true .
Malvolio's coming down the path .
I'll go back inside and ask the lady for some kind of escort .
What can possibly fix this situation ?
Are you the lady of the house ?
If this were a play , I'd complain it was unrealistic .
I didn't find him at the Elephant .
That's too bad , because I spent a long time memorizing it , and it's poetic .
I'll try to calm him down for you if I can .
rules my life." Hmm , let me see , let me see , let me see .
Neither would I .
They certainly will .
Who's she ?
Hello , sir .
No .
In Orsino's heart .
The same people who say he gets drunk with you every night .
Hello , my friends !
And when she does , he'll imagine she's flirting with him .
Beautiful ladies , please don't treat me badly .
Sebastian was my father's name , and my brother was named Sebastian too .
Won't you be glad to see that rascal dog humiliated ?
I'm in so much trouble with my niece that it wouldn't be safe to let this prank go to its conclusion .
You're better off because of your friends .
His letter's going to be hilarious .
They eat too much and get indigestion and nausea .
I don't know , madam .
What are you going to do now ?
I saw it in the orchard .
He'll release him .
Can he deny it ?
She's been drowned in salty sea water , and now my salty tears are about to drown her memory all over again .
An hour before you pulled me out of the breaking waves , my sister drowned .
The man's going crazy .
This is the man .
You're overstepping your bounds now .
My dear madam , why are you in mourning ?
Besides , she treats me more respectfully than the other servants .
Yet I wish I could .
A woman should always pick an older man .
I'll bet anything you like that nothing will happen , once again .
Maria , our lady wants you .
Sir Toby , I've got to be frank with you .
He's as
And I would die a thousand deaths cheerfully , if it made your life easier .
If they aren't , they can go hang themselves by their own laces !
What do you think of his belief ?
I'm sure nobody would have any reason to fight with me .
If you insist on trying my patience any further , then take out your sword right now .
No , I don't know you , and my lady didn't send me to get you , and I'm not supposed to tell you to come speak with her , and your name is not Master Cesario , and this is not my nose , either .
You can speak to me .
There's no ambiguity here .
I'll do it .
Go to him , Sir Topas .
How are you feeling , Malvolio ?
I remember his face well .
And by all means see if you can get the young man to answer it .
You , sir ?
He's got an answer for everything .
Why do you keep these talents behind a curtain ?
How old is she ?
This will make them both so afraid that they'll kill each other just by looking at each other .
Take me to the garden .
I'm a gentleman .
Although many people said she looked like me , she was considered beautiful .
Blab my nonsense ?
I swear to God , madam , you've wronged me , and I'll tell the whole world .
A devil like you could lead me to hell .
But tell me honestly , are you sure you're not insane ?
I swear on my life I won't tell your secret .
Haven't you totally dismissed my honor and integrity in your anger ?
Hide behind the boxwood hedge , all three of you .
Just read it .
Please don't say no .
I'm headed for your niece , sir .
Are you always so funny ?
Do you even know what you're talking about ?
Go back to your lord .
Oh , I know .
Draw your sword and get on your toes , because your assailant is quick , skillful , and deadly .
I wouldn't even pee without dancing a waltz .
What's going on , Malvolio ?
Hello , sir .
I feel sorry for you .
I wish you were what I wanted you to be !
Have you completely forgotten ?
Goodbye .
Yes , but I know , What do you know ?
With crisscrossed laces ?
Thank God and my horoscope !

Come here , Sir Andrew .
Has anyone seen Cesario ?
I swear , this fool has an excellent singing voice .
The table of contents says it's in the first chapter of his heart .
He was a wreck , almost past hope .
I swear I am .
I'll help you , Sir Toby .
Some achieve greatness , " What are you saying ?
How do you know ?
What's the obvious conclusion from that ?
As for his thoughts , I wish he'd think about nothing at all rather than think about me all the time .
Hello to you .
What does You'd have a great hairstyle if you had .
It was addressed to him , and orders must be obeyed .
His breath stinks .
Anything .
I hope to God he keeps his promise !
Madam , I will .
For her I'll be strange and condescending , and I'll put on my yellow stockings and crisscross laces right away .
Excellent !
Orsino , sir , please don't call me those names .
Come on , put your sword away , my little soldier .
It's only for your willing and receptive ear .
Madam ?
But then he said strange things to me .
There's some gentleman out there. , Good Sir Toby !
Come with me , boy .
But that's not part of what I'm supposed to say .
Does she ?
No , not at all .
Ready to set sail , sir ?
Please , fool , go away .
We only drink toasts to my niece .
Are you making all this noise at this time of night because you have no manners , or because you're just stupid ?
But my hair looks good anyway , doesn't it ?
But who is this person , sir ?
Where's my cousin Toby ?
I'm not holding your hand , sir .
Never trust me again if I don't .
with the same accessories .
Oh , I really think she loves me !
Blab my nonsense !
If only you were , sir .
I'm sorry , but I memorized what I'm supposed to say here today , and that question isn't part of the speech I learned .
Who's talking to him now ?
My friend Antonio , all I can say is thank you .
Or I'll deliver your insults to his face .
I know I can do it .
If I didn't have so many enemies in Orsino's court , I'd go join you there .
I will do so .
For some reason he's in prison now on some legal technicality , on Malvolio's orders .
I saved his life and gave him my love , without reservation .
That's it !
It doesn't need to be witty as long as it's eloquent and imaginative .
But I'll open the curtain and let you see the picture .
Women are like roses : the moment their beauty is in full bloom , it's about to decay .
He's killed three people , and he's so furious right now that the only thing that will satisfy him is seeing you die .
As the sonnet says , "If you please one special person , you please everyone who matters." Why , what's going on ?
Good-bye .
My enemies help me understand myself better , which is an advantage , and my friends help me lie about myself , which is a disadvantage .
What's the matter ?
I am the only daughter in my father's family , and all the brothers too , but I'm not completely sure about that .
And I wouldn't ask for any dowry except for her to play another trick like this one .
Why , what's the matter with him ?
Oh , you're a naughty one , encouraging double-dealing .
Hello to you too , sir .
What , faithful to being mean and nasty ?
Father , could I please ask you to tell these people what happened between me and this young man ?
I'm everywhere .
Then he's no good .
Come on , Sir Andrew , there's nothing you can do about it .
You can do whatever you want as long as it's socially appropriate .
Tell him he's not going to speak with me .
Cesario is my name , your servant's name , fair princess .
I know you .
Oh , he's drunk , Sir Toby , for a whole hour now .
Get him to say his prayers , Sir Toby , get him to pray .
Antonio , you're under arrest on the orders of Count Orsino .
It's about you .
My dear Miss Chat-her-up , I look forward to getting to know you better .
Well then , improve your situation with a show of courage .
Please answer , my good little student .
Go hang yourselves , all of you !
No , madam , I'm just reading an insane letter .
That's the weakness I'll use to get revenge on him .
I've never seen such a monster .
Someone adored me once , too .
Show him in .
He's written you a letter .
You can be a eunuch , but I'll be mute .
I wish I were something better , because right now I'm a big fool .
I don't know what you've done to upset him , but someone has challenged you to a duel .
He abandoned his friend here in an emergency , and even pretended he didn't know him .
He's a knight .
I've sent for him .
It's pretty well done , isn't it ?
Sir Toby , madam , your relative .
Madam , I will .
And what am I supposed to do in Illyria ?
Dark as hell , Sir Topas .
Open it and read it .
Fool !
That's what she was expecting , and you let her down .
He says he'll come .
If this logic works , that's great .
Here's more insanity for us .
Come on , sir , let's go .
I'm telling the truth .
I could be sad if I wanted to be .
If I miss this , let me be boiled alive .
I know his soul's in heaven , fool .
You may leave .
Oh , go away , you're a boring fool .
One face , one voice , one way of dressing , but two people !
A good person who does something wrong is only patched up with sin .
Don't worry about me .
I've heard of men who pick fights with other people on purpose , just to see how brave they are .
If you want to watch , follow me .
I'm not like you .
Hello , sir .
Well , he keeps the devil away as well as a man can in his situation .
How are you ?
But what's he like ?
Here's some money for you .
This may end without anyone getting killed .
What's she trying to say ?
No , sir , I live by the church .
No , please , read it like a sane person .
Are you trying to make fun of me ?
But don't be afraid , Cesario .
Why are you talking like that ?
You should've saved me some trouble and taken it away yourself .
Madam , please let me see your face .
Yes , but now there's no way to calm him down .
I'm going to Count Orsino's court .
Go ahead and write it down .
I was the only one who refused to give back what I stole .
Fool , fool , hey , fool !
I'll have to do something courageous then , because I hate intrigue .
It's definitely Maria's handwriting .
Oh , if it turns out to be true that he survived , then that storm was kind , and the ocean was full of love !
Stay in the dark .
I didn't give her any ring .
So we should eat and drink .
What's his name ?
I know you're the right person for this job .
Come on , sir , please .
I'd rather be a heretic than a schemer with fancy plots .
My servant !
As for Monsieur Malvolio , let me take care of him .
In fact , I'd do even more to him than what you've heard him promise to do .
It looks great .
Most sweet lady , Oh , "sweet" !
But here she comes .
Hello , sweet lady .
Did she see you there the whole time , old boy ?
It's true she looked at me a lot , in fact , she looked at me so much that she seemed distracted , and couldn't really finish her sentences very well .
I told you , someone's at the gate .
What are you thinking ?
Wind and rain can't wash it off .
You probably killed a lot of his men ?
From soldiers .
Yes , that's the one .
I was so crazy myself that I forgot all about him .
Here comes the man who rescued me , sir .
At least tell me where you're going .
I think I saw you there , you wise man .
I never hurt you .
What money , sir ?
I can't love him .
To get used to the life you'll most likely be leading soon , get rid of your low-class trappings .
That's a step in the direction of love .
Is he talking nonsense ?
Who are you ?
The rules of dueling say he has to .
Come on , let's put him in a dark room and tie him up .
I order you to stop !
He died on Viola's thirteenth birthday .
He smiles so much his face has more lines in it than a map of the East Indies .
But oh , what a deceiver he turned out to be !
Thanks for telling me .
Master Malvolio ?
He made my heart leap for you .
Sad , my lady !
For God's sake , Sir Toby , you've got to come home earlier at night .
I've heard her say that .
I'll go to him .
There's no darkness except ignorance , and you're more ignorant than the Egyptians during the plague of fog .
I'm not such an idiot that I can't keep my hands dry .
My father had a daughter who loved a man in the same way that I might love you , if I were a woman .
I like singing .
But still , she's going to kill you for being gone so long .
Signed , she who would be your servant , The Fortunate Unhappy." This is as clear as sunlight in an open field .
But you're a famous pirate !
Are you her husband , boy ?
Calm down , calm down .
I give you my obedience and my humble service , madam .
You've made up your mind , then ?
If you're just insane , then get out of here .
That's not holy , it's heresy .
Dear Mr. Fabian , do me another favor first .
If this letter doesn't make him fight , I don't know what will .
He left behind myself and my twin sister , who was born in the same hour as me .
Get the lady out of here .
Is that really what you meant ?
Fate , do your work .
Tell me that .
Meanwhile , let's go to bed and dream about this .
Anyone who refuses to drink to my niece until his brain spins around like a merry-go-round is scum .
I hope you go senile soon , sir , so you can become a more foolish fool !
I'll have to ask you some questions , madam .
Now talk to him in your own voice , and tell me how he is .
It hangs like an old worn-out mop .
Give me too much of it , so I'll get sick of it and stop loving .
Oh , no question , it won't style itself .
And you can't deny evidence and argument , They've been around since Noah's ark .
Who tricked you ?
I'll drink to her as long as there's a hole in my throat and booze in Illyria .
Tell me what a drunk is like , fool .
Shall I be your slave ?
You'd be the funniest person in Illyria, if Sir Toby ever stopped drinking .
I can't figure it out by myself !
What about it ?
Please smile whenever you're near me , my dearest darling."
What's going on ?
He insists he'll speak with you whether you want him to or not .
So cheer up , there's still hope for you , man .
Watch his reaction .
Yes , but who is he ?
I'll go on with my speech praising you , and then I'll get to the point .
I hate no-good drunks .
I'm telling you , this house is dark .
You'll get a bigger reward than you ever got delivering a letter before .
She did compliment me on my yellow stockings recently , and she said she liked how the crisscross laces looked on my legs .
I'm not a paid messenger , my lady .
I told him you were sick .
He really is the most skillful , bloodthirsty , and dangerous opponent you can find in Illyria .
Good for you , holding out on me like this !
Sir !
No man must know." What comes after that ?
Did it really work ?
Call the priest .
How strange I'm feeling !
Get to the point now .
Sir Topas , Sir Topas !
You're so attractive when you smile .
Which one of you is the lady of the house ?
I told them to take Oh , what a big mistake !
I don't know what I'm doing .
What kind of woman is she ?
Listen , if you want a good laugh , and I mean a side-splitting one , then follow me .
Goodbye .
How old is he ?
Dearest Olivia , What do you have to say for yourself , Cesario ? , My lord , please , My lord wants to speak .
Cesario , go visit that cruel Olivia one more time .
Do you have any doubts , Antonio ?
He talks nothing but nonsense .
I'll hold on to your money and leave you for an hour .
Bring us some wine !
Are you insane ?
Come on , Sir Andrew .
For someone as intelligent as you the situation must be clear enough .
Nothing can come between me and the fulfillment of all my hopes .
You can't get any more money out of me right now .
You lie .
But I'll admit I don't care for you .
How are you , Malvolio ?
Cesario , you missed your appointment with me .
He still hasn't told us about the captain .
She's a lot like you .
You might have a great opportunity to give it to him right now .
Be quick .
Sweet Sir Andrew !
Look , sir , this is a portrait of me as I am at this particular moment .
He's been over there practicing how to act for the past half hour .
Don't you think you should go to bed , Malvolio ?
What do you want to say , sir ?
Tell me why you did it .
I represent her .
I like you very much .
Taurus !
But you're not going to deliver it , are you ?
The world's gone downhill since fake humility started passing for compliments .
He's coming , madam ; but he's acting very strangely .
Where do you come from , sir ?
He's only known you for three days , but he's already treating you like a close friend .
You should have a guard nearby if he comes in here , because he's clearly disturbed .
Only really cruel people can be called deformed .
This is just what the letter said .
That's true .
I've only made it this far since I left her place , walking at a moderate pace .
If he hadn't been drunk , he would've really roughed you up .
You'd better think up a way to defend yourself .
I'll follow the priest and go with you ; and after I've sworn to be faithful , I'll be faithful forever .
Meanwhile , I'll think of some horrible way to phrase the challenge .
I think you're denying what you really are .
Honestly , I can't .
Yes , it stinks very sweetly .
Chat her up , Sir Andrew .
Come , put it over my face .
Maria !
It's really the only way , Sir Andrew .
Keep a little bit of honesty , even if you're afraid .
Aren't you Lady Olivia's fool ?
Please let me be your servant so I can be with you .
Well then , sing a lullaby to your generosity : it'll nap until I come back .
He's wearing yellow stockings .
The fool's a good actor .
Then you're a fool for being sad that your brother's soul is in heaven .
If you're my friend , you'll let me see his letter .
Fool , I say !
Yes , if you kept them together and invested them .
Shouldn't she just accept that ?
No , follow him now , before he divulges the prank and ruins everything .
He's very serious , which is right for someone in mourning like me .
Honestly , sir , I'd need to use words to explain why , and since words are so unreliable and false , I'd rather avoid using them in a serious discussion .
All the rest of you can leave too .
Fabian can hardly control him over there .
Who was it ?
My dear fool , because my brother died .
Let me see you dance .
That's why I wish my sister didn't have a name , sir .
You shouldn't talk about him like that !
Here it is .
A little bit .
As sane as me ?
Maria , take care of this poor fellow here .
There must be some mistake , sir .
Ask him in here .
Damn that dirty black coalminer of a devil !
Oh , Sir Toby , stop !
No , sir , worse off .
Malvolio , your vanity is damaging your good taste .
You're making a terrible racket out here !
Who did this to him ?
Just think , I could be Count Malvolio !
You're serious enough to know not to play games with Satan .
I don't believe it .
In what chapter and verse of his heart ?
As for his cowardliness , ask Fabian .
Please go inside .
Hunting what , Curio ?
Do you think you've got a couple of fools on your hands here ?
I breathed from my soul the most faithful offerings to your ungrateful altars that any devoted person has ever offered , what more am I supposed to do ?
I'll do my best to make this lady love you .
Dear Sir Toby , don't do anything rash tonight .
Why , he has an income of three thousand ducats a year .
I am a spirit , yes , since I have a soul .
I wish I could work for that lady !
I'd give forty pounds to be safe at home right now .
I could marry that Maria for thinking this up .
Go on .
And when she left just now , she said "Take care of this poor fellow here." Fellow ! " Not "Malvolio , " not anything referring to my low station in life , but "fellow." Everything's going perfectly .
Tell me what you want .
I like it too .
Some are born great , some achieve greatness , and some have greatness thrust upon them .
A gentleman .
I tell you , this house is as dark as ignorance .
Madam , that young man out there says he's got to speak to you .
It's as all-consuming and insatiable as the sea , and it can swallow as much as the sea can .
Who , Sir Andrew Aguecheek ?
I'll sue him for assault and battery , if there's any justice in Illyria .
I hate your logic as much as I hate an empty drinking cup .
Are you still so cruel ?
He insisted on leaving this ring with me whether I wanted it or not .
I'll write a letter challenging him to a duel on your behalf .
A duke who is noble in name and character .
I'll give it back to you .
He's going to look like a total idiot .
Close the garden door and leave me alone to hear his message .
You could've done this without your beard and gown .
I want to be this Duke's servant .
Look how shapely your legs are .
I know my medicine will work on him .
I'll help you .
No , leave him alone .
And what's her story ?
It doesn't matter how I am : he hurt me , and that's that .
The door's right here .
I wouldn't have missed this even for a pension of thousands of pounds , to be paid by the shah of Persia .
The other day I saw him defeated in a
I sent for you about a sad occasion .
And the doctors say it's healthy to get up early , I don't know what the doctors say .
Where , good Miss Mary ?
I'd write sad songs about unrequited love and sing them loudly in the middle of the night .
Signed , The poorly treated Malvolio." Did he write this ?
But if she can't love you , sir ?
Please , keep it to yourself .
This is Illyria , lady .
If you're the lady of the house , then it's true you're stealing your role , because what's yours to give away is not yours to keep for yourself .
Sing us a song .
That's the truth .
Good .
But who cares .
I can't remember anything I've ever done to offend anyone .
I can hardly keep myself from throwing things at him .
Come to my room later on .
What can I say to him , lady ?
Let's go .
Now please stop being so strange and tell me what exactly I should blab to my lady .
Believe me , I'm not .
Just come again tomorrow .
We thought he was a coward , but he fights like a devil .
No woman is strong enough to put up with the kind of intense passion I feel .
You do Stay , Please , tell me what you think of me .
If you can't , and would prefer to leave , she's very willing to say goodbye to you .
The brilliant Sir Topas !
No , I'd rather you stayed here .
I know I will too , if it's the last thing I do .
I'll write out a detailed inventory of my beauty and label every part .
Don't be afraid of greatness." That was well written .
No , sir .
Look at me now !
Put your sword away .
Set him free .
I'll be vain and proud , I'll read up on politics , I'll insult Sir Toby , I'll get rid of my lower-class friends , and I'll be the perfect man for her .
Priest .
Sir Toby Belch !
I'm as crazy as he is , if sad craziness and happy craziness are equivalent .
He's somewhere between boy and man .
He's a fool , a madman , and a drowned man .
A good fool .
I know he's noble , rich , young , and with a fine reputation .
You could just as easily say that a king sleeps near a beggar if the beggar lives near him , or that the church is supported by your drum because it "stands by" your drum .
Where's Cesario going ?
My name is Mary , sir .
What was the philosopher Pythagoras's belief about wild birds ?
I hope she doesn't have a crush on me !
But you'd still be gorgeous even if you were as proud as the devil .
Well , my friends praise me and make me look like an idiot , while my enemies tell me straightforwardly that I am an idiot .
And I too ?
This is as rude as it is strange .
No , I'm telling you , put on this robe and beard .
Oh , I thank my lucky stars , I'm so happy .
Is this the kind of world where we hide our accomplishments ?
So goodbye , my lady .
You can ride him easily , and he responds well when you pull the reins .
But if it's not double-dealing , sir , I wish you'd deal me another .
Lady Strachy married her wardrobe manager .
My prayers , you hussy ?
I could challenge him to a duel and then not show up .
Don't worry about me not swearing enough .
Orsino , this is the same Antonio who took the
You know , he got me in trouble with the lady of the house once when I arranged a bear-baiting here .
My lady Olivia's inside , sir .
He's conducting some business with my lady , and sooner or later he'll leave .
No trouble , sir .
He claimed he knew that , and that's why he's come to speak with you .
Listen , I'm going home tomorrow , Sir Toby .
Weren't we both born under Taurus ?
In his heart ?
Will you help me ? , What an ass and a fool , a gullible no-good idiot !
Not bad ; you might accomplish something .
I could really use his advice right now .
You should have run up to her , unleashed a few excellent quips invented on the spot , and rendered the young man speechless .
Do you have anything else to say ?
I'd bet my life that , as young as you are , you've fallen in love with someone .
He's a very dishonest , puny boy , and more cowardly than a rabbit .
Just a bit of my dry humor , sir .
These two people are as identical as two halves of an apple .
Run after that obnoxious messenger , the duke's servant .
I bet you're a happy fellow who doesn't care about anything .
Let's go to bed , knight .
He claimed to know that already too , and said that's the reason he's come to speak with you .
I don't care if all the devils in hell crammed together to possess him , I still want to speak to him .
I'll come too .
What's your name ?
Apparently you think there's nothing unusual about a bloody head .
If a bloody head counts as a hurt , then you hurt me .
If you can shape up , you're welcome to stay in the house .
I defy brain-death !
Mine did too .
Oh , beautiful and accomplished lady , may the heavens rain odors upon you !
That's a nice hand you dealt me .
But if I shake it up a little it'll work , because every one of those letters is in my name .
Give it to me .
Easily , madam .
You speak so highly of fools !
What ?
What country is this , friends ?
No , sir , not at all .
It's much better to be destroyed by a noble enemy than by a cruel and heartless one .
He's a fool and a spendthrift .
Oh , say it , and mean it !
By God , I'll go after him again and beat him up .
Oh , my poor brother !
Just imagine some lady might exist who loves you as powerfully and agonizingly as you love Olivia .
So shut up !
I'm going to forget my duties to you a little bit and complain about the injuries you've caused me .
So I'll be forced to call you a jerk , Sir Andrew .
I'm being gentle with you , because I'm one of those good-hearted people who are polite to the devil himself .
Remember who liked your yellow stockings , " Your yellow stockings ?
But I just can't love him .
Isn't he getting funnier ?
Give me my veil .
His eyes started glazing over around eight in the morning .
Let's go for it .
Please , hurry .
But I know you'd never force me to tell you things I don't want to , so I should be polite and tell you what I can .
What stunning , exquisite , and unmatchable beauty , but please , tell me if you're the lady of the house , because I've never seen her .
Oh , he looks like a pathetic Sunday school teacher .
That our grandmother's soul could end up inhabiting a bird .
You can't go back into the house unless you want to fight with me , and if you're willing to do that , you might as well just go and fight with him .
He must've heard that phrase describing some great man and now he's using it on a jester .
But I swear I'm not the person I'm playing .
Would you rather hear a love song or a song about the good life ?
No , my lord , not me .
My boy , it's true .
Ever since the Duke's messenger visited Olivia , she's been upset .
Oh , Antonio , I'm sorry I caused you so much trouble .
Because then I'd have to shed an ounce or two of your impudent blood .
It won't annoy you like me , because it doesn't have a voice .
Goodbye , you beautiful , cruel woman .
What gentleman ?
Hurt him in eleven different places .
Go away .
No , good Sir Toby .
I'll get back at him another way .
That duke who lives nearby is courting her .
Yes , yes .
Get out of my sight ! , Dear Cesario , please don't be offended. , Get out of here , you barbarian !
Well , well .
I respect the soul very much , so I disagree with his belief .
Husband ?
Sir Toby would bet a fortune that I'm not smart , but he wouldn't bet two cents that you're not a fool .
It's possible , ma'am .
Why , anyone can see what this means .
If you leave like this , my dear , I won't ever use my sword again .
Here she comes , the brilliant fool-catcher .
Now go !
All I know is that staying up late is staying up late .
He cut my head and gave Sir Toby a bloody head , too .
Here comes the Duke now .
What do you mean by that , Malvolio ?
For the love of God , call a doctor !
Oh , Lord !
Leave me alone .
I don't want to have anything to do with you anymore .
I don't think so , my lord .
Here's money for you .
What's the matter with you ?
Why , sweetheart ?
Good night .
Goodbye .
My dear lady , Please let me say something , I'm begging you .
Come with me , please .
The captain who brought me to shore has my women's clothes .
If you love me , let me know by smiling at me .
I refuse to accept that .
I wish you all the best .
Fight to the death" is his motto .
But don't think I'm doing this because I'm greedy .
I'm just wandering , with no particular destination .
I'll only admit that you're sane when you agree with Pythagoras and hesitate to kill a bird because it might contain your grandmother's soul .
I know I'm not fooling myself , or letting myself get carried away by my imagination , because every clue points to the fact that Lady Olivia loves me .
If God had been willing , I wish we had died in the same hour too !
So let me hear what you have to say .
I'll let you get away with skipping the praise .
Go ahead .
We'll have another bear-baiting just to make him angry , and we'll mock him till he's black and blue .
My legs may be yellow , but I don't feel blue .
I think we know whose fancy handwriting that was .
Do you want to go hunting , my lord ?
Do you make your living by playing that drum ?
Who I am and what I want are a secret .
So find someone younger to love , or you won't be able to maintain your feelings .
What ?
So could I .
How did you divide yourself in two ?
Should we do that ?
Do you want to go see him ?
Nonsense .
Oh , I'd never be that cruel .
Then don't make yourself too conspicuous .
How could I honorably give him what I've already given you ?
So go out there and give him what he wants .
No , madam .
Nothing , except your true love for my lord .
Sure thing , we'll do it tomorrow morning .
But please forgive me , darling , for the sake of the vows we made to each other so recently .
This man is probably like that .
God bless you , my friend , and your music too .
Who's the ruler here ?
I will , my lady , but a sane person reading this would make it sound crazy .
But there was a rumor , you know , people always gossip about royalty , that he was in love with the beautiful Olivia .
What could you possibly ask of me that I wouldn't give you , as long as it didn't damage my honor and self-respect ?
I've heard my father mention him .
I'll never believe a madman until I can see his brains .
I can't love him .
I know a lot about the love women can feel for men .
I'm sorry , Malvolio , but this isn't my writing , though I admit it looks like mine .
You call this house dark ?
How is that possible ?
I won't mess with him .
After you cast your magic spell on me last time , I sent you a ring .
You've shut me up in a dark room and given your drunken cousin authority over me , but I'm as sane as you are .
Yes , my lord .
Come on , get ready .
It's too bad their beauty fades right when it reaches perfection !
Please let me prove you're a fool .
Ah , the countess is coming !
The whole quarrel might have been resolved since then when we repaid what we stole from them , which most of our city did , for the sake of friendly trade relations .
I'll be back soon to wake up your generosity .
He was the captain of a flimsy boat that was practically worthless because it was so small .
Absolutely , you idiot .
I mean please go into the house , sir .
I had a round with him , and his sword thrust is so deadly that you can't even duck out of the way .
You're wrong about that , I assure you .
Good .
Why are you bothering this poor man !
Sir , you need a drink .
I did , Malvolio ?
Who treated you badly ?
Well , that proves she's in love with you .
If we don't , it'll be the biggest disappointment of our lives .
Don't refuse it .
I'm no more insane than you are , and I'll prove it .
Wow , he's a real devil .
You have my word as a gentleman that I'll always be grateful to you .
Take this .
Sometimes I think I'm no smarter than average .
I'll get free of you .
He's furious because you insulted him , and he has a right to satisfaction .
Oh , I've read that .
Here comes my lady .
That means it's more likely to be fake .
Excuse me , weren't you with Countess Olivia just now ?
M" , why , that's the first letter in my name .
I couldn't stay behind after you left .
Leave them alone until he sets off home , and then follow him .
Yes , good fool .
Good night , you amazing woman , you .
I would've given it to you this morning , but a madman's letters aren't Gospel , so it doesn't matter much if I'm a bit late .
I am , unless I somehow stole this role .
Though the last time I saw him it was black from the smoke of war .
I can do anything !
Take him away .
Take away this fool , gentlemen .
So let her execute me .
Ah , how will this all turn out ?
You're right , sir .
My niece Olivia will notice , and let me tell you , no matchmaker in the world can get you a woman faster than a reputation for courage .
The first drink makes him a fool , the second makes him crazy , and the third drowns him .
I'm the man she wants .
Has it been so long ?
You don't know me .
Thanks for your trouble .
Well , her name's a word , and if you fooled around with it you might make her into a whore .
All right , I'll stay another month .
We human beings don't control our own destinies .
Here comes Sir Toby , limping .
Here he is , here he is .
Who's that at the gate , uncle ?
Should I blab to her that you're coming ?
Do that .
Well , he'll be dead , so he won't see anything .
A love song , a love song .
Gentleness is the only way to go , gently , gently .
Cesario , come here .
What's wrong with my niece ?
For the love of God , help us !
I'll give it to him .
You're right .
Come along with us , Signor Fabian .
I'll tell them where you come from , though I don't know who you are or what you want .
Don't you have any respect for anything ?
Oh ho !
Play me some music .
I hate an ungrateful man more than I hate lying , vanity , babbling , drunkenness , or any other vice that we feeble human beings are susceptible to. , Oh , my God !
My girlfriend has beautiful white hands , and great warriors aren't Ha , ha !
He knows I recognize him .
Fabian , bring him here .
You're asking me !
It must be something I did accidentally .
Besides , you've gotten unreliable .
God will protect me .
My message is not for anyone else to hear , my lady .
Give me your hand and let me see you dressed in woman's clothing .
Never .
Are they likely to get dusty ?
You're smiling ?
How unbelievable !
Everyone , please leave us alone for a moment .
How are you , sir ?
What an idiotic place this world is .
Now that I think about it , Maria was the one who first told me you were insane .
Make him think you're Sir Topas the priest .
Stop right now or I'll throw your dagger over the roof .
That was excellent , really excellent .
I don't care what you think of me .
Actually , their hearts are as sensitive and loyal as ours are .
People say he's generous , well educated , and brave , and he's very attractive .
But you're still complaining of darkness and a bad view ?
Didn't you hear her , guys ?
If only his lord were more like him .
Tell her my love is purer than anything else in the whole world , and has nothing to do with her property .
I certainly will , sir .
Stop , Sir Toby !
Yes , and he'll keep getting funnier till he dies .
While I waited , I'd frown impatiently , and perhaps wind my watch , or play with my , with some expensive piece of jewelry I happen to be wearing .
You seem to be a good person , captain , and although people who look beautiful are often corrupt inside , I believe that you have a beautiful mind to go with your good looks and manners .
Why , man ?
Some are born great , "
You'll know more about it later .
He'll think these letters are from Olivia and that she's in love with him .
I'll give it a try .
I won't take it back .
Oh , it sounded like a sweet breeze blowing gently over a bank of violets , taking their scent with it .
Here comes the little villain herself .
That's true .
How are you , my golden girl ?
If that means I don't care about anything , you should disappear right now , since you're nothing .
Then I'll pay you for doing what you like .
I promise .
That's true .
What can I give you that you want , my lord , except the one thing you can't have ?
I swear I will , Come on , let's go see what happens .
This is going to be great !
Look out for him in the corner of the orchard as if you were a sheriff's deputy .
Will either of you give him the message that I'm challenging him to a duel ?
He really was tricked horribly .
You threw it at her rudely , and she wants you to take it back .
No , the legs and thighs .
Are you good at those kinds of things ?
A beautiful voice , I swear .
So if four negatives make two affirmatives , I'm worse off because of my friends and better off because of my foes .
He's pale and hyperventilating , as if a bear were chasing him .
Well , I'll commit the sin of double-dealing , and deal you a second coin .
Accept it in body and spirit .
It's true , he died on the day my sister turned thirteen .
I swear , anyone smart who laughs at these courts jesters is nothing but a jester's apprentice .
Tell me what it's about .
Sir , the person who should sing that song isn't here .
The devil inside him is rough , but we can't treat it roughly .
I'd send seven of my servants to go get him .
Orsino .
It's going to be fun , I promise .
What would you do about it ?
creet .
He's somewhere else in the house .
Wise men who give fools money might get a good reputation , if they keep up regular payments for fourteen years .
Here comes the messenger with your niece .
I'm not bringing any declarations of war or demands for cash .
I'm coming in peace .
Be the person you know you are , and you'll be as powerful as this person you fear .
No , sir , I won't let you go .
I'm very sensitive , and even the smallest bit of rudeness hurts my feelings .
Ah-ha !
What kind of man is he ?
It starts , "Shut up." I'll never be able to start if I shut up .
What do you say to that , Malvolio ?
Andrew Aguecheek"
Shut up , you troublemaker , no more of that .
What a wonderful time to be alive !
I don't have any "brilliant" reason for it , but I have a good enough reason .
Should we go see the sights in the town ?
Thank you .
Is this the madman ?
I'll have you two hide , and the fool too , right where he'll find the letter .
My lord , I swear to you , Oh , don't swear !
I'm listening to you only because I've got nothing better to do .
There's something going on that's not what it seems .
What are you going to do ?
My friends , are you all Lady Olivia's servants ?
He couldn't see you .
Why are you talking like this ?
Tomorrow you need to get more money sent to you .
Take me .
You too , Fabian .
I'd be very grateful to you if you did .
Go ahead .
She's a fine woman , all right .
But I don't get it , what's the joke ?
Which one is Sebastian ?
I know that my lady's going to end up hitting him .
Are you always going to be like this ?
Come on .
Fool , I'll repay you for this favor .
That's out of tune , sir .
She flirted with the messenger boy to exasperate you , fire up your passions , and make you angry and jealous .
Keep myself ?
So this letter , which is so incredibly stupid and ignorant , isn't going to scare him at all .
I'd give half my dowry to keep anything bad from happening to him .
You're all lazy and shallow .
I can't let my lips say his name ; "No man must know."
By my birth I rank above you , but don't be afraid of my greatness .
Well , go along now .
Anyway , sir , should I go see the lady ?
I'll be thrilled .
Or are you just pretending ?
You're wrong , you madman .
Be loud and obnoxious .
Anyone who says you're a man must not notice how young you are .
Sometimes all I want to do is see plays and go out dancing .
These crisscrossing laces do cut off the circulation in my legs a bit , but who cares ?
If you were a woman , I'd hug you now and cry , and say "Welcome back , drowned Viola ! " My father had a mole on his forehead .
We respected the beat of the song , sir .
Was he sent by Count Orsino ?
She took that ring from me .
I'm not insane , Sir Topas .
I recognize your face perfectly , even without a sailor's cap on your head. , Take him away .
And I beg you , please come here again tomorrow .
Let's dance to "You Jerk." You mean , "Shut up , you jerk" ?
Have some of my servants take care of Malvolio .
Yes , you have to tell us why , Sir Andrew .
Just a man , like any other .
You've never seen anything like it .
Ah , no .
My lady would never want to lose him .
Are you ready , sir ?
Madam !
Get me some ink , paper , and a candle .
Please , do me this one favor : find out what I've done to offend this knight .
I've been so tortured since I lost track of you !
Is it possible ?
If you let her go this easily , Sir Andrew , you don't deserve to ever use your sword again .
Your lord knows what I think .
Why , would that have fixed my hair ?
If he's got a message from the count , tell him I'm sick , or not home .
Me too .
Haven't you , boy ?
When I first heard about him , he was still a bachelor .
Let me enjoy my privacy .
Who did this , Sir Andrew ?
Don't say that , unless you want to be one of my friends .
Oh , please , I'm begging you , don't mention him again .
He'll just think an idiot wrote it .
You'll introduce me to him as a eunuch .
The three-beat rhythm is a good for dancing , and the church bells chime , one , two , three .
Well , you know , "some are born great , some achieve greatness , and some have greatness thrust upon them." Anyway , I was part of the trick , sir .
Your hand is Well , I hope so .
They're good enough to drink in , and so are these boots .
I think you're right , sir .
But come on , start .
How does he love me ?
No man must know." What if this someone were you , Malvolio ?
Love is so vivid and fantastical that nothing compares to it .
No woman's heart is big enough to hold all my love .
Good fool , good jester , I'll make it worth your while if you get me a candle , and a pen , ink and paper .
How can that be ?
Doesn't that sound like true love ?
Well , God is responsible for that , not me , and he deserves thanks .
A gentleman ?
Wait , here's a coin for you .
But silence , like a knife , cuts open my heart With strokes that draw no blood .
Noble people don't answer to peasants !
Are you Sebastian ?
Nice and short and full of good sense , or should I say nonsense ?
Don't compare a woman's love for a man with my love for Olivia .
Orsino .
Madam , you've treated me badly , very badly .
Go away .
It's my duty to be quiet .
But oops , when I let go of your hand , I let go of the biggest joke of all .
There's a lot to learn when a fool recites the words of a madman .
Well , she can get used to it .
And maybe a third ?
But as a gentleman and a soldier he's promised me he won't hurt you .
Old age always makes people act funny , even wise people , but fools more than anybody .
Oh , I remember that very clearly !
For God's sake , shut up !
If you tell your lady I'm here to speak with her , and bring her out with you when you come back , you might make me more generous .
But I'll get you a candle and paper and ink .
How tragic !
Come here !
But wait , there's some prose after her poem .
How are you , Sir Toby Belch ?
She's not good enough for you , then .
I am still so faithful , my lord .
Yes , husband .
Go where , my lord ? , Cesario , my husband , stay here .
You're a smart guy .
Darn it , if I'd guessed he was so brave and such a good swordsman , I never would have challenged him .
Sir Toby needs help right away .
You've made him so delusional he'll go crazy when he learns the truth .
But I'll deliver Sir Andrew's challenge by word of mouth , describing Sir Andrew as courageous in battle and convincing the young gentleman that Sir Andrew is furious , impetuous , and a skilled fighter ( he'll believe me because he's young ) .
He's a good-looking young man , and there are a lot of people with him .
You still haven't said anything incriminating .
And as for what I promised to you , I'm as good as my word .
Don't give up yet .
I don't know what else it could be .
There's a picture of me inside .
Where's Antonio , then ?
But did your sister die of love ?
Oh , only time can sort out this mess .
It's easier to buy young people than to beg or borrow them .
Get rid of your low-class trapping , " she said .
Please , and I'll pay you plenty for this , help me conceal my identity , and find me the right disguise so I can look the way I want .
She's sending this ring back to you , sir .
Stay right here and try to look good .
My brother is in heaven .
He must be possessed by the devil .
Oh , I'm talking too loud. , Where's Malvolio ?
God bless you , Mr .
That's definitely too old .
I've got her now , but I've got God to thank for it !
From that cabin I'd call out to my soul .
Anything I did to you , I did it because Sir Toby made me .
So listen up , princess .
What do you want ?
Maybe you'll see some little trinket you want to buy .
May I kiss your feet ?
Antonio , oh my dear Antonio !
That governs the torso and heart , doesn't it ?
To bed !
I'm better off because of my enemies , and worse off because of my friends .
No , I won't stay a second longer .
If he can not , let the tailor mend him .
My lady told me to tell you that while she lets you stay at her house because you're a relative , she doesn't approve of your behavior .
Nothing is what it is .
An angel is walking on earth .
Damn that Toby !
Taste your legs , sir .
I rescued that ungrateful boy next to you from drowning .
But you began so rudely .
Here , take the ring .
Why are you leaving , my angry friend ?
My Cesario ?
Call in my maid .
I accept that offer happily , madam .
No , he just smiles .
You're absolutely right .
But it has bay windows that are as transparent as stone walls , and the upper windows facing south-north are as clear as coal .
I remember .
Fool !
Keep your money .
Be a nice fool and help me find a candle and some paper .
Go , Sir Andrew .
Meanwhile , I'll get Sir Toby .
It doesn't matter that I hit him first .
It's half of all my money .
If only I could somehow relate them to me !
Next time God sends out a shipment of hair , I hope he gives you a beard !
I'll give him my gray horse Capilet if he forgets the whole thing .
If this young gentleman has offended you , I'll take the blame for it .
Why don't you go off to church dancing one way , and come home dancing another way ?
Well , because I saw your niece Olivia treat the count's messenger better than she's ever treated me .
This guy's wise enough to play the fool , and only clever people can do that .
I was telling you to go after her , woo her , confront her .
And he doesn't let go of his target when a distraction appears .
Oh , please be true , please let it be that this man has mistaken me for you , my dear brother !

Well , death is the end for everybody .
Didn't he come home last night ?
Oh , she knew very well that you were acting like you were in love without really knowing what love means .
I don't know his name .
I drew my sword to part them .
My sweet , so do I .
I want to take the love I had for my cousin and take it out on the body of the man who killed him .
Go wisely and slowly .
If I had seen something like that , I would have quickly pulled out my weapon .
That's him , that villain Romeo .
Goodbye , cousin .
I hear that you must marry this count on Thursday , and that nothing can delay it .
Oh , deadly sin !
Well , may peace be with you .
I'm done for in this world , I believe .
If they see you , they'll murder you .
Only you would look for a fight like that .
Wife !
He carries himself like a dignified gentleman , and , to tell you the truth , he has a reputation throughout Verona as a virtuous and well-behaved young man .
Nurse , where's my daughter ?
By my count , I was already your mother at just about your age , while you remain a virgin .
I'm finished .
Come , Romeo .
Don't " Yes , Nurse , what about that ?
And what about that ?
Her eyes are saying something .
Oh , that's a joke made out of leather that spreads itself thin , from the width of an inch to as fat as a yard .
I asked a servant .
Well , Susan died and is with God .
I'll come with you .
You know where I live .
Who should now pay the price for Mercutio's life ?
No matter .
Two unlucky children of these enemy families become lovers and commit suicide .
Get away from here and leave me .
You take your beauty sleep now .
How sweet it would be to actually have the woman I love , when merely thinking about love makes me so happy .
I'm involved in your rivalry .
I'll never be satisfied with Romeo until I see him .
No , not until Thursday .
Romeo has been banished." That news brings infinite death .
But as soon as the sun rises in the east , my sad son comes home to escape the light .
I'll bite my thumb at them .
Oh heavens !
Everything you told me I already knew .
Oh , he's a lovely gentleman !
In the beautiful city of Verona , where our story takes place , a long-standing hatred between two families erupts into new violence , and citizens stain their hands with the blood of their fellow citizens .
Please , sir , have patience .
If my heart's dear love , Well , don't swear .
Look , look !
Your love says , like an honorable gentleman , who is courteous , kind , handsome , and , I believe , virtuous , where is your mother ?
Who's calling me ?
Your husband lies dead there , and Paris too .
If you were ever yourself , and this sadness was yours , you and your sadness were all for Rosaline .
Go , tell the Prince .
You don't know how to pick a man .
I've found it out .
No , Romeo will respond to the letter's writer , telling him whether he accepts the challenge .
Climb up to her bedroom and comfort her .
Will you pull your sword out of its sheath ?
Stand up .
Now my sin has been taken from my lips by yours .
The other girl did not love me .
Oh painful sympathy !
Don't saints and pilgrims have lips too ?
Whose house ?
God in heaven bless her !
Well go on home .
Come , come with me , and we'll do the job quickly .
Go wake Juliet .
He locks himself up alone in his bedroom , shuts his windows to keep out the beautiful daylight , and makes himself an artificial night .
Your cheeks are thin because of hunger .
Oh , I was such a beast to be angry at him .
He's alive and victorious , and Mercutio's dead ?
Yes , let the count take you in your bed .
Then I'll call you a serving-creature .
Tsk , you're wrong .
Are you gone like that , my love , my lord ?
Father , what's the news ?
Hurry up , I say .
If love is blind , it can't hit the target .
If we look like musicians to you , you can expect to hear nothing but noise .
She's not even fourteen .
Oh Lord , they're fighting !
I don't have the thing that makes time fly .
Our love , which right now is like a flower bud in the summer air , may turn out to be a beautiful flower by the next time we meet .
Oh , brother Montague , give me your hand .
What have you found out ?
Don't think about her .
Let it go .
Lady , come out of the tomb .
Or was I dreaming ?
Your Juliet is alive .
Won't he ?
Have you come to make confession to this father ?
Well , well , I don't care .
I met the young man at Lawrence's cell .
Your love will use it to climb up to your window while it's dark .
Tell me , Friar , in what part of my body is my name embedded ?
Now you're sociable .
I'll follow after you .
You speak well .
Peter !
What further pain must I endure in my old age ?
I'll go call the watch .
Can't you understand what I'm saying ?
Stay , then .
Go away and stay apart from me .
Your servants were fighting your enemy's servants before I got here .
If you act like my daughter , I'll marry you to my friend .
You're this poor and wretched and still afraid to die ?
Herbs , plants , and stones possess great power .
Am I really like one of those guys ?
But what do you say to my request ?
Death has sucked the honey from your breath , but it has not yet ruined your beauty .
My child , my reason for living , wake up , look up , or I'll die with you !
Tonight I'm having a feast that we've celebrated for many years .
They're calling for dates and quinces in the pastry kitchen .
I can read .
Come along with me .
But it's enough .
Madam !
O flesh , flesh , you've turned pale and weak like a fish .
Is my father well ?
Therefore your relatives are no obstacle .
Yes , yes , this is the rope ladder .
The Earth is nature's mother and also nature's tomb .
Why would you do that , my love ?
Well , do what you want .
Welcome , gentlemen .
Signor Martino and his wife and daughters , Count Anselme and his beautiful sisters , Vitruvio's widow , Signor Placentio and his lovely nieces , Mercutio and his brother Valentine , My uncle Capulet and his wife and daughters , My fair niece Rosaline and Livia ,
He ran this way and jumped over this orchard wall .
These times of pain are bad times for romance .
Lie down right there .
Shame on Romeo !
You had this child with the help of heaven .
Did a dragon ever hide in such a beautiful cave ?
That banishment is worse than the murder of ten thousand Tybalts .
You should be able to endure this because the world is broad and wide .
Now I see the blood rushing to your cheeks .
Monday !
Stand up if you're really a man .
Out of love ?
And aren't you a Montague ?
It did , it did .
Tomorrow is Wednesday .
You'll find me ready enough to do that , sir , if you give me a reason .
I'll send a man to Mantua , where that exiled rogue is living .
If he's been killed , say "Yes." If not , say "No." These short words will determine my joy or my pain .
That braggart , punk villain who fights like he learned swordsmanship from a manual !
Look , and you'll see .
Take my advice .
I'm not here .
I will leave here for Verona tonight .
He deserves only honor , complete honor .
Before I could break up the fight , Tybalt was killed .
This calm submission is dishonorable and vile .
Arms , make your last embrace !
You won't , then ?
Oh sweet Nurse , what news do you bring ?
Alright , here's the vial .
What is the matter ?
That might be the case sir ,
Are you this impatient ?
It's not true because she separates us .
And trust me , love , you look pale to me too .
And then , I hope , you'll be satisfied .
You pale face !
A little bit of grief shows a lot of love .
Welcome , gentlemen .
Don't talk back to me .
I wish the fool were dead and married to her grave !
I'll be a harsh master to them .
Otherwise , you'd see me blushing about the things you've heard me say tonight .
What ?
You'll fight with a man who's cracking nuts just because you have hazelnut-colored eyes .
You disgust me , you little bug !
I'm only trying to keep the peace .
I will kiss your lips .
But when I say so , I swear she turns white as a sheet .
Who's that calling so loud ?
If you sink , you're dragging love down .
Don't you have one word of joy ?
Yes , alright , go , I say , and bring him here .
Where are the evil men who started this fight ?
So stop crying .
Why , she's inside .
No , cousin , I'm crying .
She's talking , but she's not saying anything .
The bridegroom is already here .
Oh , pardon me for bringing this bad news , but you told me it was my job , sir .
Peter !
I know where he is .
It's all the same .
God forbid that I should prevent sacred devotion !
Give me a torch .
Do as you please , because I'm done worrying about you .
Hey , Nurse !
Don't talk to me , because I won't say a word .
I brought my master news of Juliet's death .
I must hide in the darkness for awhile .
Yes , those are the best clothes .
Who's ruining my rituals of true love ?
Hey , bride !
I'm arresting you as a criminal .
Here in Verona there are girls younger than you , girls from noble families , who have already become mothers .
The sound of lovers calling each others names through the night is silver-sweet .
What ?
He was my brother's son !
How can I bring those promises back down to earth , unless my husband sends them back down to me by dying and going to heaven ?
No , not him , though his face is more handsome than any man's , and his legs are prettier , and as for his hands and feet and body , they're not much to speak of , and yet they're beyond compare .
What must be will be .
You gave us the slip , sir , the slip .
Alright , I will .
He looks skinny , like a dried herring without its eggs , and he hasn't got his girl .
You have the sacred power to cure both of us .
Curse your families !
I swear to you by my virginity at age twelve , I already told her to come .
Romeo , Romeo , Romeo !
Holy Saint Francis , this is a drastic change !
My employer is as good as yours .
Aren't you Romeo ?
No .
Calm down , gentle cousin .
Tybalt , old Capulet's nephew , has sent a letter to Romeo's father's house .
The Prince will give you the death penalty if you get caught .
Here comes my man , the man I'm looking for .
I won't tolerate him .
Showing mercy by pardoning killers only causes more murders .
Oh Friar , damned souls use the word banishment to describe hell .
Let me be captured .
I am the youngest man by that name , because there is no one younger , or worse .
I want my sword .
Oh , this is a painful time !
Then I'll really give it to you .
Holy Father Lawrence instructed me to fall on my knees and beg your forgiveness .
Now , I swear by Saint Peter's Church and Peter too , he will not make me a joyful bride there .
You worthless girl !
That "may be" must be , love , on Thursday .
Hey !
Tybalt , that murderer , which way did he run ?
If I answered that question , I'd be making confession to you .
Oh , that most wicked fiend !
A woman more beautiful than the one I love ?
Farewell .
Why should you fall into so deep a moan ?
I'll bite you on the ear for that joke .
I'm not myself .
I know all of this .
I won't hide unless all the mist from my heartsick groans envelopes me like fog and conceals me from people's searching eyes .
Look at other beautiful girls .
If you're a member of a divine spiritual order of men who forgive sins , and you say you're my friend , how do you have the heart to mangle me with the word banishment ?
Hey , mistress !
Hey , hurry up , hurry up !
I'm losing this duel of wits .
I wish I were Sleep and Peace , so I could spend the night with you .
The wind you're talking about is blowing us off our course .
Go , girl , look for a man who'll give you happy nights at the end of happy days .
Oh , I wish I could make a My soul is calling out my name .
You say you don't know what the girl thinks .
Welcome back from Mantua .
Goodness , it's daylight .
Go ask .
I've stayed up all night many times before for less important matters , and I've never gotten sick .
Who is that gentleman ?
Listen , she loved her cousin Tybalt dearly , and so did I .
I'll conjure him as if I were summoning a spirit .
Benvolio is part of the Montague family .
So I die with a kiss .
Don't stand there shocked .
Was there ever such an evil book with such a beautiful cover ?
Oh , Juliet , I already know about your sad situation .
I'm at your service .
There are two opposite elements in everything , in men as well as in herbs , good and evil .
Alright , let's fight , boy !
I can't believe that dog , that rat , that mouse , that cat could scratch me to death !
Please , follow straight after me .
Are you going to say good things about the man who killed your cousin ?
Alright , I will .
At Friar Lawrence's cell she can make confession and be married .
Don't deny to him that you love me .
What are you , girl ?
I wish you had my bones , and I had your news .
I wish I was your bird .
Is the worst well ?
Another studpid answer !
Lose nothing ?
Then I'll be quick .
Nurse , will you come with me to my closet and help me pick out the clothes and the jewelry I'll need to wear tomorrow ?
Can God be so jealous and hateful ?
I'll go , sir , and I won't bother you .
I'll be with you right away .
Even if the news is sad , tell me with a smile on your face .
I'm not one of his sluts .
And yet you're the one who wants to teach me about restraint !
Hey , lady !
But please tell me , can you read anything you see ?
I won't listen to your pleas or excuses .
Just say "Yes" and I will turn more poisonous than the snake with the evil eye .
Some people in the street are crying "Romeo." Some are crying "Juliet , " and some are crying "Paris." They're all running in an open riot toward our tomb .
It's already almost night .
Very well taken , I believe , very wise .
Come , come away .
Oh , so madmen like you are also deaf .
Now , before the sun comes up and burns away the dew , I have to fill this basket of mine with poisonous weeds and medicinal flowers .
Hold on , then .
If you who are so wise can't help , please be kind enough to call my solution wise .
It's torture , not mercy .
Oh , rude and unthankful boy !
Here comes the furious Tybalt back again .
I'd rather they killed me than have to live without your love .
So the cooks who can't lick their fingers aren't hired .
Let them put fear in your heart .
I don't like it .
Your joke is a very bitter apple .
Virginity makes her look sick and green .
Not me , believe me .
Sin from my lips ?
More and more light .
If he says anything against me , I'll humble him , even if he were stronger than he is , and twenty punks like him .
You could not prevent her from dying someday , but heaven will give her eternal life .
Then you were right on target .
Let's go there .
Her bridegroom is here .
I had come to the deepest part of my tale , and I planned to say nothing more on the topic .
Are you a man ?
Put it together with something else .
It's the lark that sings so out of tune , making such harsh noise .
Don't you have a letter for me from the friar ?
To supper ?
I hope sores cover your tongue for a wish like that !
Hurry up , or I'll smack you on the ears with my sword before you have yours drawn .
I stretch my joke for that word "fat." If you add that word to the word "goose , " it shows that you are a fat goose .
It makes me mad .
Let me see her .
I wish that no one could avenge my cousin's death except me !
What do you want from me ?
Romeo killed Tybalt .
When evil is dominant , death soon kills the body like cancer .
Have courage , man .
Are you speaking from your heart ?
Do you have news from Verona ! , What is it , Balthasar ?
But go ahead and charm her , gentle Paris ; make her love you .
Go there and compare her objectively to some other girls I'll show you .
Let me keep weeping for such a great loss .
You haven't been conquered .
Now please listen , sir .
Give it to me !
Who is it ?
May a plague strike both your houses .
I will be brief because I'm not going to live long enough to tell a boring story .
And then I'll be the leader of pain , and maybe I'll lead you as far as death .
If I were in the habit of fighting the way you are , my life insurance rates would be sky high .
I know you'll say "yes , " and I'll believe you .
Flies can kiss her , but I must flee the city .
My master's house .
Madam , I'm here .
Tybalt was my nephew !
Oh love !
I drink to you .
Oh God ! , Oh Nurse , how can this be stopped ?
I know what I'll do .
Now he's ready for
They howl about banishment .
Accursed , unhappy , wretched , hateful day !
I'll forget that I have any home besides this spot right here .
Speak , nephew .
I'll give my vile body back to the earth .
She is in a better place .
Don't stay here , go away .
I wouldn't insult him in my own house for all the wealth in this town .
Because it's dark out , I'm afraid all this is just a dream , too sweet to be real .
Tybalt was my dearest cousin .
He'll wake you up , I bet .
I hear a noise inside .
I'll send my eyes to prison , and they'll never be free to look at anything again .
The wound can't be that bad .
You were never with me for anything if you weren't there for the goose .
But I won't let myself fall for him any more than your permission allows .
He's hiding out in Friar Lawrence's cell .
She disgusts me , the little hussy !
Come break this up , Benvolio .
Can't you wait for a moment ?
Ha , banishment ?
You're whiter than snow on the black wings of a raven .
Is that the rope ladder Romeo told you to pick up ?
What is this blood that stains the stony entrance of this tomb ?
There is no world for me outside the walls of Verona , except purgatory , torture , and hell itself .
Curse my very heart , but I think you should be happy in this second marriage , because it's better than your first .
What's the problem , that they cry out so loud ?

Can your man keep a secret ?
So , goodbye .
You wouldn't tell a sick man he "seriously" has to make his will , it would just make him worse .
I hope maybe then you'll send him back home soon .
Give me the vial .
You blush bright red as soon as you hear any news .
Yes , she will .
For when you cut your shin .
Tell me so I can be satisfied .
Death is my son-in-law .
Romeo will thank you , my girl , for both of us .
The ground is bloody .
Have you seen him today ?
Oh pain !
And now you've changed ?
It's out of fashion to give lengthy explanations like that .
Nurse , give my regards to to your lady .
What ?
What should I swear by ?
Oh , she's slow !
And Juliet's just as much in love as he , but she has even less opportunity to meet her lover .
You look pale and wild as if you're going to hurt yourself .
What will we say is our excuse for being here ?
You'll be sick tomorrow because you've stayed up all night .
Madam , if you can find a man to deliver the poison , I'll mix it myself so that Romeo will sleep quietly soon after he drinks it .
Do you have permission to go out and take confession today ?
You mean I should groan and tell you ?
Some kind of fountain ?
But tell me seriously who it is .
Groan ?
Good night .
The things I'm saying are fair and honest .
Send for the Count .
Wake up the Montagues .
What's all the noise in here ?
Day has broken .
It's only just now nine o'clock .
Were you here when it started ?
Flies are like free men , but I have been banished .
I'll confess to you that I love him .
Romeo , get out of here .
At my humble house tonight , you can expect to see dazzling stars that walk on the ground and light the sky from below .
It's some meteor coming out of the sun to light your way to Mantua .
How can this be ?
Excuse me , sir , do you know how to read ?
What kind of man are you ?
I'm going to the Friar to find out his solution .
No , my good lord .
You'll Enough of this .
Now that you are down there , you look like someone dead in the bottom of a tomb .
That can't be .
Then young men love with their eyes , not with their hearts .
More and more pain for us .
Very suspicious .
There's still a stain on your cheek from an old tear that hasn't been washed off yet .
Everything depends on this : either be out of here before the night watchmen take their positions , or leave in disguise after daybreak .
Why , may I ask ?
Romeo will answer the challenge .
There's no point in looking for him if he doesn't want to be found .
What do you mean I faked you out ?
The beautiful Rosaline whom you love so much will be at Capulet's traditional feast , along with every beautiful woman in Verona .
There's plenty of time .
Come out , you frightened man .
My back aches too ,
Put your hand on your heart and listen to my advice .
Have you given up so quickly on Rosaline , whom you loved so much ?
Go be with your love , as it was decided at your wedding .
Isn't she proud of such a match ?
Yes , madam .
Young man , something's wrong if you're getting out of bed this early .
Send your man away .
I think it's too rough , too rude , too rowdy , and it pricks like a thorn .
May God choose you to receive his grace .
Here , sir , this is a ring she asked me to give you .
I'm a friend , a friend who knows you well .
Be quiet , for shame !
Thursday is coming .
I'm biting my thumb .
Have some others search .
Despised , distressed , hated , martyred , killed !
Didn't you argue it out with your tailor for wearing one of his new suits before the right season ?
That is a certain truth .
Yes , well , things could get better .
Find out the way , and I'll find the right man .
But like I said , on the night of Lammas Eve , she will be fourteen .
Farewell , farewell !
Be quiet , you mumbling fool !
I'll go to him .
What time tomorrow should I send a messenger to you ?
Why are you waiting ?
I'll go alone .
Hold him in custody until the Prince gets here .
Give me the letter .
Hurry up , it's getting late .
But I am thankful that you have found it .
Your mother .
Goodbye , Goodbye !
Where's Potpan ?
I saw her buried in her family's tomb , and then I came here to tell you the news .
I have already condemned and excused myself .
I'm not going to bed tonight .
Please , tell my father , madam , I won't marry yet .
What if this mixture doesn't work at all ?
What a man , young lady .
Ah , Juliet if you're as happy as I am , and you're better with words , tell me about the happiness you imagine we'll have in our marriage .
Sweet Montague , be true .
No , it's not as deep as a well , or as wide as a church door , but it's enough .
Is that how it is , really ?
And why , wise lady ?
You , Prince , are the man who can give me justice .
Oh , there's my lady !
Come on , wake up , wake up , wake up !
Yet I wish I could take that promise back , so I had it to give again .
Was I even close to you in the chase for the goose ?
No , not a sad song .
Come on , what did Romeo say ?
Look , my love , what are those streaks of light in the clouds parting in the east ?
Ha , ha !
Therefore , love each other in moderation .
Is he man enough at this point to face off with Tybalt ?
We're ruined , lady , we're ruined !
Well , we can put away our pipes and go home .
Oh , you're wrong .
Sometimes she rides over a courtier's lips , and he dreams of making money off of someone .
You have to contradict me , do you ?
Ah , where's my servant ? , Give me some brandy. , These griefs , these pains , these sorrows make me old .
Good morning , cousin .
Come on !
Let's see how .
I carry no hatred , holy man , because my request will benefit my enemy .
I hate the word peace like I hate hell , all Montagues , and you .
You will also confess , I'm sure , that you love me .
Why are you knocking so hard ?
She's been dead for some time .
I'm whipped and tortured , May God give you a good evening .
I would be glad to forget about it , but it weighs on my memory like sins linger in guilty minds .
Are you trying to start a fight ?
Is the Prince's punishment any less awful than doomsday ?
Saints don't move , even when they grant prayers .
Men's eyes were made to see things , so let them watch .
Darkness is stumbling out of the sun's path like a drunk man .
The curfew-bell rang .
Don't tell me that you've heard about this marriage , Friar , unless you can tell me how to prevent it .
As I slept under this yew-tree here , I had a dream that my master and someone else were fighting and that my master killed him .
The citizens are around , and Tybalt is dead .
Here comes the lady .
Oh , for God's sake .
I have forgotten why I called you back .
This sight of death is like a bell that warns me I'm old and I'll die soon .
He is the son and heir of old Tiberio .
Can't you find a reason without my giving you one ?
Girls younger than she often marry and become happy mothers .
I'd bet fourteen of my own teeth , but , I'm sorry to say , I only have four teeth , she's not fourteen .
The second cock crowed .
I'll punish you so harshly that you'll regret causing me this loss .
Sweet , sweet , sweet Nurse , tell me , what did my love Romeo say ?
You're getting too angry .
That's good , my boy .
Do you love me ?
No , I haven't had lunch .
It's a sweet lozenge that you choke on .
You don't have to go yet .
Tell me if it's good or bad , and I'll wait for the details .
I can read my own fortune in my misery .
Your face is mine , and you have slandered it .
Good father , I'm begging you on my knees , be patient and listen to me say just one thing .
Here , here I'll remain with worms that are your chamber-maids .
I don't dare , sir .
I swear , you speak the truth .
You lie .
Oh , then I see you've been with Who's Queen Mab ?
I'll find your servant , and he'll update you now and then on your case as it stands here .
Is it now afternoon ?
Tybalt's death would be bad enough if that was all .
I'm smart enough to find the logs myself without bothering Peter .
Sadness takes away our color .
I'm done for .
No , good goose , don't bite me .
Madam , I am not well .
Well , Juliet , I'll lie with you tonight .
Cruel , cruel Death killed her .
Go tell him about this .
I pay you because you're poor , not because you want me to buy this .
Is it really true ?
Only God knows when we'll meet again .
You know how young my daughter is .
It would have been better if , after she said , "Tybalt's dead , " she told me my mother or my father , or both , were gone .
I wish night would come , like a widow dressed in black , so I can learn how to submit to my husband and lose my virginity .
With Rosaline , father ?
Oh my , what's the news ?
My generosity to you is as limitless as the sea , and my love is as deep .
It's not the right time to play .
They both begin with the letter "R." Ah , you jokester , that's the dog's name .
Romeo , are you crazy ?
Go to the church .
The boy is warning me that someone approaches .
You have the best sorts of happiness to enjoy .
Sing my praises to your mistress .
Either go someplace private , or talk it over rationally , or else just go away .
Where is my page ?
I see that you are poor .
That dirty rat !
Thank you , dear Nurse .
Get on your way and hire those horses .
He's not telling the truth .
Oh painful , painful , painful day !
The world is not your friend , and neither is the law .
Where are my father and my mother , Nurse ?
If the news is good , you're ruining the sweet news by playing a trick with a sour face like that .
Yes , I know her age down to the hour .
No words can express the pain .
Mercutio , be quiet .
You're not taking one step toward an enemy .
Tybalt is lying over there .
Oh , he's acting just like Juliet , just like her .
Yes , that's true .
She's calling out my name as if I were a bullet murdering her , just like I murdered her relative .
Oh , you're just going to talk about banishment again .
What , are you hurt ?
Death is my heir .
Oh , in this love , you love your child so badly , that you go mad , even though she is in heaven .
She's dead , she's dead , she's dead !
Give me comfort .
Oh , do you think we'll ever meet again ?
O Lord , I could stay here all night listening to such good advice .
Don't you see that I'm out of breath ?
That guy's funny .
Goodbye .
Stop crying .
Take me inside some house , Benvolio , or I'll pass out .
Sir Paris , I'll make a desperate argument for my child's love .
I made my father angry , so I went to Friar Lawrence's cell to confess and be forgiven .
But love gives them power , and time gives them the chance to meet , sweetening the extreme danger with intense pleasure .
Please tell me .
She was tricked , divorced , wronged , spited , killed !
She and Susan , God rest her and all Christian souls , were born on the same day .
Here's a drink .
Our celebratory hymns will change to sad funeral marches .
Leave me alone .
Were you talking about Juliet ?
How often tonight have my old feet stumbled on gravestones !
There's a husband there who's waiting to make you his wife .
What , you don't say a word ?
Break it up." Then he jumped in between them and forced them to put their swords down .
What do you say , James Well , I don't know what to say .
Inside the little rind of this weak flower , there is both poison and powerful medicine .
We're bound to each other in every possible way , except we need you to marry us .
Let's talk .
Well , you have made a foolish choice .
If I live to see you get married someday , all my wishes will come true .
What do you want ?
Look how she leans her hand on her cheek .
May a plague curse both your families .
I'm happy to meet you , my lady and my wife .
Well then .
His arrow has pierced me too deeply , so I can't fly high with his cheerful feathers .
Oh , go away !
Why , isn't all this joking better than groaning about love ?
I can tell that you don't know who I am .
Well , you have given me great comfort .
I won't miss any chance to send my love to you .
Ah sir , ah sir .
Oh , are you going to leave me so unsatisfied ?
From now until then seems like twenty years .
He was not born to be shameful .
Come on , you can be as angry as any guy in Italy when you're in the mood .
I have news for you about the Prince's punishment .
We shouldn't have too big a celebration , we can invite a friend or two .
Romeo , come out .
Good night .
Now , before God , our whole city owes this friar a great debt .
Hurry up , hurry up .
Then the dovehouse shook with the earthquake .
How can you be out of breath when you have enough breath to tell me that you're out of breath ?
Probably because my cousin the villain would have killed my husband .
How should madmen hear , if wise men can't even see ?
Where is my husband ?
He killed your relative , brave Mercutio , and then young Romeo killed him .
You would take it back ?
To our house .
Tell me seriously , who is the one you love ?
Was that my father who left here in such a hurry ?
Hit them !
My baby hawk ?
Sadness over my son's exile stopped her breath .
Come on , we're wasting precious daylight .
If that's not the case , then this must be the answer : You , Romeo , have not been to bed tonight .
We found him in the churchyard .
Let's get away , Tybalt .
And it's good to have joy in such a joyless time .
I've said nothing wrong .
Tomorrow night make sure that you are alone .
Good man , why are you crying ?
Oh my !
I'm glad he wasn't here for this fight .
Well , girl , you're weeping not for his death as much as for the fact that the villain who killed him is still alive .
Keep going , keep going , or I'll declare myself the winner .
But come on , inconsistent young man , come with me .
I have time for you now , my sad daughter .
Oh , my liege , my wife died tonight .
I do .
She's ready to go , but she'll never return .
What is this fuzzy logic ?
Do you need my help ?
Yes , you've been a ladies ' man in your time .
You won't stand and fight .
Ask for me tomorrow , and you'll find me in a grave .
My soul depends on it , A thousand times good night .
Good afternoon , fair lady .
Only to be generous and give it to you once more .
Oh life !
Good morning to you both .
Please be quiet .
The strangers are all gone .
Let them judge us however they please .
Parting is such sweet sorrow that I'll say good night until tonight becomes tomorrow .
There has never been so black a day as today .
You go to Friar Lawrence's cell .
Do you hear me ?
Let me tell you , the man who marries her will become very wealthy .
It is "music with her silver sound , " because musicians have no gold to use to make sounds .
I swear to you , You have a good heart , and believe me , I'll tell her that .
Romeo killed Tybalt .
The groans you used to make are still ringing in my old ears .
God bless you !
The sun itself has never seen anyone as beautiful since the world began .
I sent the Nurse at nine o'clock .
Romeo's a dishcloth compared to him .
I don't want to dance .
Romeo , are you going to your father's for lunch ?
What ?
She's too beautiful and too wise to deserve heaven's blessing by making me despair .
I ask that again because nothing can be wrong if she is well .
Wait , Tybalt , wait !
Wish me luck .
You'll fall backward when you grow up , won't you , Jule ? " And she stopped crying and said , "Yes." Now you stop too , Nurse , please .
Oh God , did Romeo's hand shed Tybalt's blood ?
Take away the stools , the sideboards , and the plates .
Everyone says you can't make up your mind .
Oh friendly friar !
Brother , I'll go and bring it to you .
Tell me , how did you get in here ?
You can't talk about something that you don't feel .
What strange reason could she have for coming here ?
Be honest and helpful , and I'll repay you for your efforts .
What satisfaction could you possibly have tonight ?
Capulet , you villain !
I had a dream last night .
I'll tell you before you have to ask me again .
And now you cry , even though she has risen up above the clouds , as high as heaven itself ?
Your last guess is right .
A jumbled confession can only receive a jumbled absolution .
I'm not one of his punk friends who carries a knife .
Why do you complain about your birth , the heavens , and the earth ?
I hope you're lucky enough to hear the true story by sticking around .
Either put away your sword or use it to help me stop this fight .
You would fight with a man if he had one more whisker or one less whisker in his beard than you have in your beard .
Our wedding banquet will become a sad burial feast .
What's going on , Juliet ?
I bet he slipped away and went home to bed .
My eyes were liars , then , because I never saw true beauty before tonight .
Oh wife , look at how our daughter bleeds !
I can only repeat what I've said before .
There is no life , but my love is dead !
They should get to bed early and get plenty of sleep .
Let's get out of here .
But whatever misfortunes occur , they can't ruin the joy I feel with one look at her .
No gentlemen , don't get ready to go now .
Oh , my !
Madam , tell me quickly , what day is that ?
I scolded you for obsessing about her , not for loving her , my student .
I assure you , my man is as true as steel .
Your love says , like an honorable gentleman , 'Where is your mother ?
That's three hours since nine o'clock , but she hasn't come back .
I hate my name , dear saint , because my name is your enemy .
You are dead !
What did my man say ?
They are crying and moaning over Tybalt's corpse .
Oh , he's like a snake disguised as a flower .
We took this pickax and this shovel from him , as he was walking from this side of the graveyard .
Well , that one , I think , is young Petruchio .
Oh cousin , cousin !
As we were trading blows , more and more people showed up to join the fight , until the Prince came and broke everyone up .
Let's go !
You're in love ?
Well , sir , because silver has a sweet sound .
That's how flimsy and unreal pleasure is .
Get me some ink and paper , and hire some horses to ride .
Here's Romeo's man .
This is as bad as the tortures of hell .
Or should we enter without apologizing ?
Well , well , you have a careful father , child .
Hey , love , I say !
Who are you ?
I swear , it must be thirty years .
Oh , poor Romeo !
Don't reply .
Oh , by this count I'll be many years older before I see my Romeo again .
For shame , bring Juliet out here .
That villain , Romeo .
I nursed her daughter , whom you were just talking to .
Give my compliments to your lady .
Here's something good .
Tonight she is shut up in her room , alone with her sadness .
Right , and well said .
Be quick for a while and let the one who lives the longest take everything .
Go on , go on .
Love will give me strength , and strength will help me accomplish this plan .
I'll cry my tears for Romeo's banishment when their tears are dry .
Where is my Romeo ?
Hold the friar too .
I had only one child , one poor child , one poor and loving child , the one thing I had to rejoice and comfort myself , and cruel Death has stolen it from me !
Beat them down !
Sometimes she tickles a priest's nose with a Enough , enough !
I have my naked sword out .
Whichever of you acts shy , I'll swear she has corns .
She's not talking to me .
Think about the ones who have died .
Go .
Where the devil can Romeo be ?
He's dead .
Old Montague is here , and he's waving his sword around just to make me mad .
We'll have the wedding at the church tomorrow .
Oh , what better favor can I do for you than to kill the man who killed you with the same hand that made you die young .
For himself to ruin , " he says .
He struck me from under your arm .
Nurse !
Tybalt is dead , and Romeo has been banished .
Oh no !
Therefore we'll have about half a dozen friends to the wedding , and that's it .
Sweetheart !
You scolded me often for loving Rosaline .
I'll answer for you .
Are you biting your thumb at us ?
All this is comforting news .
Yes , if I know the language and the letters .
Take this .
Now I'll tell you so you don't have to ask .
Tell me , my good friend , what is that light over there ?
Yes , madam , he lies beyond my reach .
On Thursday , sir ?
Let them start something .
Your wild actions resemble the irrational fury of a beast .
You won't get any bad cooks from me .
Wait good Nurse .
Come , death , and welcome !
How long has he been there ?
His son was a minor only two years ago .
My lord , I wish Thursday were tomorrow .
Answer me like men .
If everything else fails , at least I have the power to take my own life .
I will die and leave Death everything .
But I can't help laughing to think that the baby stopped crying and said , "Yes." I swear , she had a bump on her forehead as big as a rooster's testicle .
I am content , if that's the way you want it .
Out here everybody can see us .
Things have turned out so unluckily , sir , that we haven't had time to convince our daughter to marry you .
The fight is between our masters , and we men who work for them .
Have you done everything you could to make him tell you the reason ?
For a full half hour .
Either my eyesight is failing me , or you look pale .
Farewell !
Their unfortunate deaths put an end to their parents ' feud .
Give me one kiss , and I'll go down .
I'll go to lunch .
Then I rebel against you , stars !
That's the way to show me friendship .
Onward , lover boys !
Now I must go to the tomb alone .
I'm begging you , good Mercutio , let's call it a day .
Some say the lark makes a sweet division between day and night .
I will .
You , good friend , save me a piece of marzipan , and if you love me , have the porter let in Susan Grindstone and Nell .
They lie in bed while they dream about the truth .
I'm ready .
The most you hope for was for her to marry wealthy and rise up the social ladder , that was your idea of heaven .
Have a nice day !
But now I have joyful news for you , girl .
Oh my , my bones ache so much .
Her blood has stopped , and her joints are stiff .
I'll go with you .
What , are you busy ?
He's a raven with the feathers of the dove .
Indeed , I should have asked you before who he was .
I'll pretend to be the housewife for once .
But to say that Tybalt's dead and then say , "Romeo has been banished." To say that is like saying that my father , my mother , Tybalt , Romeo , and Juliet have all been killed , they're all dead .
Romeo !
It looks to me like it's burning in the Capulet tomb .
Feeling the loss like this , I can't help but weep for him forever .
We're talking here in a public place .
Either you , or I , or both of us have to go with him .
But why , you villain , did you kill my cousin ?
Don't say "banishment." From now on , you are banished from Verona .
She's shut inside a dead man's tomb !
You can't get out of trouble by praying or crying , so don't bother .
There's two , a man and a woman .
She's dead , deceased , she's dead .
I want to stay more than I want to go .
Have you told her our decision ?
Within an hour , one of my men will come to you behind the abbey wall and give you a rope ladder .
You foolish madman , listen to me for a moment .
I am no villain .
Are you going ?
What does he say about our marriage ?
If there were two men like you , pretty soon there'd be none because the two of you would kill each other .
Forget about him , Jack !
Teach me to forget to think !
I'm a man , my lady , that God has made for himself to ruin .
Oh , a footstep as light as hers will never endure the rocky road of life .
You're a lover .
Give me those flowers .
Oh , where's Romeo ?
I've been hurt .
I don't know , sir .
Romeo cried out , "Stop , my friends .
Then hurry up and rush over to Friar Lawrence's cell .
Go , get out of here .
So what ?
Although you bring me joy , I can't take joy in this exchange of promises tonight .
We'll follow you .
What are you going to tell her , Nurse ?
What ?
She's lying on the ground just like him , blubbering and weeping , weeping and blubbering .
Who is her mother ?
In the meantime I wrote to Romeo and told him to come here on this awful night to help remove her from her temporary grave when the sleeping potion wore off .
Haven't you ever heard the saying , "Two can conspire to put one away" ?
What does my hidden wife say about our ruined love ?
Is love really tender ?
I'll bury you in a magnificent grave .
Amen , amen .
That is the key to long-lasting love .
Somebody's knocking .
Oh , I'm very scared something awful has happened .
Be good .
Don't disturb the heavens any more by trying to go against heaven's will .
Madam , your mother wants to talk to you .
Oh painful day , Oh painful day !
Out .
Every old man has worries , and worried men never get any sleep , but young men shouldn't have a care in the world .
Rust inside my body and let me die .
That light is not daylight , I know it .
Don't say anything else .
Are you trying to wash him out of his grave with tears ?
Oh , blessed , blessed night !
But I would kill you by petting you too much .
Pick up this rope ladder .
Tell him so yourself , and see how he takes the news .
Everything's out of control .
Go to your bedroom .
What I'm saying can't anger him .
Speak one rhyme , and I'll be satisfied .
Now he'll sit under a Let's go .
I'm suddenly afraid .
Do you think it's a good idea to rush ?
Take Cupid's wings and fly higher than the average man .
Romeo is hateful , even though God isn't .
What do you think about Thursday ?
A grave ?
But if you have to swear , swear by your wonderful self , which is the god I worship like an idol , and then I'll believe you .
Take away this body , and do what I say .
But a lot of old people act like they're already dead , sluggish , slow , fat , and colorless , like lead .
If he hears you , you'll make him angry .
Unhappy fortune !
Yes , " said my husband , "Did you fall on your face ?
I wish I had not lived long enough to see him die .
It's still a long time until daybreak .
It's not daylight .
Well , I'm glad about this .
Put the torch out , so I can't be seen .
Come over here , nurse .
Angry enough to run away .
Is it my mother ?
Beat the drum .
Indeed , my child , at Saint Peter's Church early Thursday morning , the gallant , young , and noble gentleman Count Paris will happily make you a joyful bride .
Good morning , father .
Oh , " he said , "Did you fall on your face ?
How can you test them like that ?
That's very soon .
He's not your man .
How is she doing ?
Now get out of here .
And , when I do marry , I swear , it will be Romeo , whom you know I hate , rather than Paris .
Now heaven has her .
You're wearing dancing shoes with nimble soles .
This is the place .
It's Mercutio's relative , noble Count Paris !
He made this rope ladder to be a highway to my bed , but I am a virgin , and I will die a virgin and a widow .
Hide yourself , good Romeo .
May God in heaven bless you .
Mercutio , you hang out with Romeo .
Day and night , hour after hour , all the time , at work , at play , alone , in company , my top priority has always been to find her a husband .
Let's go at it , coward !
Oh my !
My lord , you're wrong to berate her like that .
What do you want ?
I'll come back .
How is my Juliet ?
I won't move to please anybody .
It is an honor that I do not dream of .
The woman I love is beautiful .
Destructive thoughts come quickly to the minds of desperate men !
Then do my lips now have the sin they took from yours ?
Shame on you !
When only one or two men have all the good manners , and even they are dirty , things are bad .
Nurse ?
Brother , hey !
He says more in one minute than he does in a whole month .
Madam .
He's not the most polite man in the world , but , believe me , he's gentle as a lamb .
Within three hours Juliet will wake up .
How sound asleep she is !
Poison , I see , has been the cause of his death .
I didn't tell you to get rid of one love and replace her with another .
You should go to Juliet and dress her up .
Then she is well , and nothing is wrong .
Then the window lets day in , and life goes out the window .
Indeed , I remember it well .
I sink under the heavy weight of love .
It's someone with a torch !
No we're not , it's night .
You have more wild goose in one of your jokes than I have in five of mine .
This fight will decide who dies .
He lets the bird hop a little from his hand and then yanks him back by a string .
But like I said , when she tasted the bitter wormwood on my nipple , the pretty little babe got irritated and started to quarrel with my breast .
She will A pimp !
Down with the Montagues !
But he has to make his speeches of love to a woman who's supposed to be his enemy .
His crime did justice's job by taking Tybalt's life .
But I've been sent to find the people whose names are written on this list , and I can't read !
No money , I swear .
Cheers , boys .
My master is the great and rich Capulet , and if you don't belong to the house of Montague , please come and drink a cup of wine .
If you leave me like this , you're doing me wrong .
Believe me , I'll draw my sword as quick as any other man if I see a fight starting and the law is on my side .
But here come some people , right in the nick of time .
Everyone prepare to take this beautiful corpse to her grave .
Call to him , Mercutio .
So , where should we eat ?
Just cry out , "Ah me ! " Just say "love" and "dove." Say just one lovely word to my good friend
Give me my sin back .
You know too much about suffering .
Come here , man .
Whether it's even or odd , of all the days in the year , on the night of Lammas Eve , she'll be fourteen .
Oh , I wish she knew how much I love her .
I'll look at him and try to like him , at least if what I see is likable .
Tell me , my daughter Juliet , what is your attitude about getting married ?
Flies are healthier and more honorable and better suited for romance than Romeo .
Let me stand here until you remember your reason .
We don't need to hear it .
Did he get away clean ?
If her eyes were in the night sky , they would shine so brightly through space that birds would start singing , thinking her light was the light of day .
What else is love ?
Uncle , this man is a Montague , our enemy .
Two of the brightest stars in the whole sky had to go away on business , and they're asking her eyes to twinkle in their places until they return .
Oh , what a sad day !
Pharmacist !
Oh nature , what were you doing in hell ?
Dinner is over , and we're going to get there too late .
By nine o'clock .
That's because the murderer is alive .
Look , sir , here comes the lady walking toward my cell .
Tybalt is dead , and Romeo has been banished."
Did you have no poison , no sharp knife , no weapon you could use to kill me quickly , nothing so disgraceful , except banishment ?
Goodbye .
This is good .
Don't let the Nurse stay with you in your bedroom .
Go and get her dressed .
Or , if he wrote down his thoughts , give me his letter .
I'll go and chat with Paris .
No .
Oh luck , luck .
What an annoying man , this guy is !
A beautiful target is the one that gets hit the fastest .
So now turn and draw your sword .
Now , good sweet Nurse , Oh Lord , why do you look so sad ?
His face will make the heavens so beautiful that the world will fall in love with the night and forget about the garish sun .
Now I'll go see my priest , to ask for his help and tell him about my good luck .
So get out of here !
Just ignore him .
Here comes your father .
That knife should be in its sheath on that Montague's back , but instead it's mis-sheathed in my daughter's breast .
Monday , my lord .
Go blabber with your gossiping friends .
My daughter married death .
I'll make you sing .
Don't swear at all .
Then who took my letter to Romeo ?
Go .
Give me some comfort , Nurse .
Oh Romeo , Romeo , brave Mercutio is dead !
Peter , wait for me at the gate .
I am tired .
Your humor is a spicy sauce .
Do so , and tell my sweet to be ready to scold me .
Thursday it is , then .
Even if it's not better , your first marriage is over .
Are you going to provoke me ?
In my desperate situation , I have to act alone .
A jealous woman , a jealous woman !
Let me be put to death .
Madam , good night .
It was .
If I can trust my dreams , then some joyful news is coming soon .
My daughter is still very young .
Yes , pilgrim , they have lips that they're supposed to pray with .
Come , I'll place you among the sisterhood of holy nuns .
Don't worry about the cost .
Amen !
You're not paying attention to me .
Seriously , cousin , I love a woman .
Please grant my prayer so my faith doesn't turn to despair .
You poor soul , your face has suffered many tears .
And why did you come ?
I make her angry sometimes by saying that Paris is more handsome than you are .
Oh , I wish I was the glove on that hand so that I could touch that cheek .
He's been seen there many mornings , crying tears that add drops to the morning dew and making a cloudy day cloudier with his sighs .
Let playful people with light hearts dance .
Tell us what you know about this affair .
It was a painful bruise , and she was crying bitterly .
I hear you say "proud" and "I thank you , " and then "no thank you" and "not proud , " you spoiled little girl .
So did I .
Give me your torch , boy .
And so , good Capulet , which is a name I love like my own name , you should be satisfied with what I say .
What kind of devil are you to torture me like this ?
Oh , holy Friar , Oh , tell me , holy Friar , where is my lady's husband ?
Go to bed , dear .
That's foolish .
I'll fight you .
Are you going to join them ?
Oh , sad day !
I bet it's a challenge .
And tell her , listen to me , on Wednesday , Wait , What day is today ?
The man who killed Mercutio , which way did he go ?
Then don't move while I act out my prayer .
Wretched boy , you hung out with him here , and you're going to go to heaven with him .
My noble uncle , do you know why he acts this way ?
You will feel the loss , but the man you weep for will feel nothing .
Curse the day !
Doesn't she realize how unworthy she is of the gentleman we have found to be her bridegroom ?
Lucentio's son is older than that , sir .
Her body sleeps in the Capulet tomb , and her immortal soul lives with the angels in heaven .
Why the hell did you come in between us ?
Will you cry about your cousin's death forever ?
But where have you been ?
If I can't do it myself , I'll find someone who can .
Is it that early in the day ?
Oh , Tybalt , Tybalt , he was the best friend I had .
Calling death banishment is like cutting off my head with a golden ax and smiling while I'm being murdered .
Juliet lies here , and her beauty fills this tomb with light .
Why do you look so upset ?
I'll frown at them as they pass by , and they can react however they want .
I headed toward him , but he saw me coming and hid in the woods .
I can tell by his voice that this man is a Montague .
Answer that question .
I'll call you a minstrel .
What do you have to say , my dear Nurse ?
I hope you sleep peacefully .
Eyes , look out for the last time !
She's not even fourteen years old .
You're making such a fuss .
Then isn't it just the right dish for a sweet goose ?
Curse the day !
Too fast is as bad as too slow .
Listen , your Romeo will be here tonight .
I think I see my cousin Tybalt's ghost .
Is it good or bad ?
May a plague strike both your families !
Good and noble young man , don't mess with someone who's desperate .
Are you really going to tell me that ?
Well , sir , my mistress is the sweetest lady .
The Right .
I hope you enjoy the same sweet peace and rest I feel in my heart .
Who greets me so early in the morning ?
It's a cup , closed in my true love's hand ?
What is this ?
But he's not better than mine .
Noble Mercutio , put your sword away .
Why did this have to happen now ?
But like a misbehaved , sullen girl , you're whining about your bad luck and your love .
As I remember , this should be the house .
Mistress !
Leaving you is a thousand times worse than being near you .
Come , night .
I bet she's fast asleep .
Tybalt wanted to kill you , but you killed Tybalt .
There , where the torch is burning .
Oh great , here come the Capulets .
Give me that pickax and the crowbar .
But I'll write again to Mantua , and I'll keep her in my cell until Romeo comes .
Why are you acting so angry ?
He knows what ?
How is she ?
Romeo !
No !
Summertime in Verona has no flower as fine as him .
Do you bring me a letter from the friar ?
Leave me and do what I told you to do .
If you were as young as I am , if you were in love with Juliet , if you had just married her an hour ago , if then you murdered Tybalt , if you were lovesick like me , and if you were banished , then you might talk about it .
The excuse you make to delay the news is longer than the news itself .
That's really news !
You're right .
Oh , it is my love .
Oh my , Oh my !
Perhaps you've learned from life and not from books .
Well , start thinking about marriage now .
Oh , noble prince , I can tell you everything about the unfortunate circumstances of this deadly fight .
You have so much natural talent , but like someone who hoards money , you use none of your talent for the right purpose , not your body , not your love , not your mind .
Gregory , remember how to slash .
Three words , dear Romeo , and then it's good night for real .
From the Earth's womb , many different sorts of plants and animals come forth , and the Earth provides her children with many excellent forms of nourishment .
That sound you heard was the It was the lark , the bird that sings at dawn , not the nightingale .
Live , and from now on , say a madman mercifully told you to run away .
Curse the day this happened , but it did .
Can't I say something ?
I enjoyed a sweeter rest than sleep .
Cut off their heads ?
My head is pounding .
Oh , good , a knife !
It's not earlier than that , I tell you .
Stay here for a moment .
My soul is made out of lead , and it's so heavy it keeps me stuck on the ground so I can't move .
So to be banished from Verona is like being banished from the world , and being banished from the world is death .
God bless you .
Romeo is coming .
If I do so , it will mean more if I say it behind your back than if I say it to your face .
Well , what was your dream ?
This makes me feel so much better !
You were the prettiest baby I ever nursed .
Where's Romeo ?
Go with me to the tomb .
You mean their Cut off their heads , take their maidenheads , whatever .
What does Romeo say ?
Get up , man !
Maybe she can't find him .
It's a good thing you're not a piece of fish .
I'll find Romeo to comfort you .
Let me talk to you about your situation .
What's this ?
There was no need to tell me to get out of there .
But I'm wishing for something I already have .
Tybalt , I have a reason to love you that lets me put aside the rage I should feel and excuse that insult .
Night is over , and day is coming .
Where is my mother ?
I'll tell you more later about when and where we met , how we fell in love , and how we exchanged promises , but now I'm begging you : please , agree to marry us today .
And with another for tying the new shoes he made with old laces ?
What about that ?
Well then , saint , let lips do what hands do .
Death , which has taken her away to make me cry , now ties up my tongue and won't let me speak .
The women you rape are the ones who'll have to "sense" it .
What's this ?
My soul and not my child !
Signor Valentio and his cousin Tybalt , Lucio and the lively Helena." That's a nice group of people .
Yes , boy , I'm ready .
Have you killed Tybalt ?
We mean well by going to this masquerade ball , but it's not smart of us to go .
Tell her to come to me .
Let the blood rushing to my cheeks be calmed .
Will I be married tomorrow morning ?
Well , we were all born to die .
Give me your hand .
I don't know , and he won't tell me .
I see .
They're looking for you in the great chamber .
Tell her about my son Paris's love for her .
She was too good for me .
Boy , your words can't excuse the harm you've done to me .
Benvolio , who started this fight ?
Who's the one who's going out the door right now ?
You're like one of those guys who walks into a bar , slams his sword on the table , and then says , "I pray I never have to use you." By the time he orders his second drink , he pulls his sword on the bartender for no reason at all .
So calm down .
Here is a friar who's trembling , sighing and weeping .
Oh , sad day !
And everything will be alright , I promise you , wife .
They've turned me into food for worms .
Are they washing out his wounds with their tears ?
I'm sure you have your hands full preparing for the sudden festivities .
And death , not Romeo , can take my virginity !
Up .
I thought it was the right thing to do .
How is my wife ?
Believe me , I'm sorry you're in pain .
If you could , you couldn't bring him back to life .
You kiss like you've studied how .
I had put bitter wormwood on my breast as I was sitting in the sun , under the wall of the dovehouse .
I hit hard when I'm angry .
Not to his father's house .
Where do you come from ?
Now you're Romeo .
Well , that's an Stay , fellow .
Be merciful and say "death." Exile is much worse than death .
You mean however they dare .
Run to the Capulets .
I swear by my holy order , I thought you were smarter and more rational than this .
It is , it is .
Take these keys and get more spices , Nurse .
I'll teach you a lesson .
Make it a word and a blow .
It is written that shoemakers and tailors should play with each others ' tools , that fisherman should play with paints , and painters should play with with fishing nets .
What villain , madam ?
What , are you crazy ?
My dream told me that dreamers often lie .
Then I'll smack you on the head with the serving-creature's knife .
My words would bounce her to my sweet love , and his words would bounce her back to me .
Show yourself in the form of a sigh .
We won't take their garbage .
No , noble Romeo , you've got to dance .
From now on , take care of your messages yourself .
Oh , noise ?
Today's a holiday , so the beggar's shop is shut .
Is the news good or bad ?
Why , then , should I cry ?
If love plays rough with you , play rough with Come on , let's knock and go in .
Oh God , I have a soul that predicts evil things !
Romeo must die .
The Get out of here !
She's dead , like a beautiful flower , killed by an unseasonable frost .
Love's messengers should be thoughts , which fly ten times faster than sunbeams .
It is best to marry well and die young , better than to be married for a long time .
Give my regards to your lady , and tell her to hurry everybody in the house to bed .
Just look at me kindly , and I'm invincible against their hatred .
It's been longer , it's been longer .
Lord , Lord , when she was a little baby , Oh , there is one nobleman in the city , a guy named Paris , who would be happy to claim her as his own .
Yes , a thousand times .
Then repeat this after me : you can't expect women to be faithful when men are so unreliable .
Lord , Lord , she'll be a happy woman .
Have I waited so long to see this morning , only to see this ?
Your mother is coming to your bedroom .
It's been eleven years since the earthquake .
Romeo .
You're an insolent little boy .
What is this ?
A greater power than we can fight has ruined our plan .
Take my remark in whichever sense you like .
Be happy that you're alive .
His love is blind , so it belongs in the dark .
Leave me alone for a minute .
Has Romeo been killed , and is Tybalt dead too ?
I hear some noise .
I pledged my love to you before you asked me to .
I can see in your eyes that you're starving .
Wait .
I would have made it short .
Here are forty ducats .
Well , you're not on target there .
You But , uncle , we're being disrespected .
What an awful day !
Holy Franciscan Friar !
Find the people whose names are on this list ?
There is nothing on Earth that is so evil that it does not provide the earth with some special quality .
Now you know the reason for the rush .
Please , I beg you , don't scold me .
Good morning , gentlemen .
What will you give us ?
Why are you still crying ?
Who's that calling ?
Goodbye , dear Father .
Hang out ? " Who do you think we are , musicians in a band ?
Or else love is blind , and its best time is the night .
Now , fellow , what have you got there ?
Look , she's come home from confession with a happy look on her face .
This is the most miserable hour of all time !
Down with the Capulets !
Go , you old housewife , go .
I remember very well where I should be , and here I am .
I'll bring you there .
We're unprepared for this wedding celebration .
You have amazed me .
Use your clubs and spears !
And yet you say that exile is not death ?
We can't be in two places at once , both here and there !
No , sir .
Delay this marriage for a month , or a week .
I can imagine more than I can say , I have more on my mind than words .
Where are they supposed to come ?
He's thirty years old .
I'm locked up in a prison and deprived of food .
Have you spoken to him ?
Educated men are so impressive !
Start a fight ?
My husband is alive on earth , my vows of marriage are in heaven .
The cure for confusion is not yelling and screaming .
There were twenty Montagues fighting in this awful riot , and together those twenty could only kill one man .
In the meantime , hold on , and be patient .
I'm in a rush .
Those who rush stumble and fall .
Is it young Romeo ?
Everybody knows I'm a nice piece of flesh .
That rotten scoundrel !
Where else would she be ?
Give me my fan , Peter .
Take a little vacation in Mantua .
Well then , I'll say this quickly : the valiant Paris wants you as his bride .
For Juliet's sake , for her sake , rise and stand up .
Can I go away while my heart stays here ?
Yes she has , and by keeping celibate , she wastes her beauty .
And you told me to bury my love .
I couldn't go to Mantua because I was stuck there .
Your head is as full of fights as an egg is full of yolk , but your head has been beaten like scrambled eggs from so much fighting .
Do as I tell you .
If any of my relatives find you here they'll kill you because of who you are .
Isn't that what he said ?
I'd give anything to keep them from seeing you here .
Oh , look !
Don't say anything .
I love rich Capulet's daughter .
Get up .
Leave him alone .
Has Romeo killed himself ?
Life , wealth , everything belongs to Death .
I won't fail .
You're Pull out your tool now .
Please , young man , don't make me angry .
Why , what's Tybalt's story ?
What's this noise ?
That sounds like the voice of Friar John .
How can I marry him , this husband , before he comes to court me ?
Should I believe that death is in love with you , and that the awful monster keeps you here to be his mistress ?
You started a fight with a man who coughed in the street because he woke up a dog that was sleeping in the sun .
Come on , you're being ridiculous !
Tell me , so I can cut it out of myself .
I am the greatest , but I was able to do the least .
The world doesn't make laws to make you rich .
Is this the cure for my aching bones ?
If she was young and passionate , she'd move as fast as a ball .
It is the east , and Juliet is the sun .
I'll make this wedding happen tomorrow morning .
I Let's not break the law by starting a fight .
His drugs work quickly .
Good night , good night .
Give my regards to your daughter .
Think about it .
We have a little dessert coming up .
Tomorrow I'll send the messenger .
Madam , an eagle does not have eyes as green , as quick , and as fair as the eyes of Paris .
Listen , because Tybalt was just killed , people might think that we don't care about his memory as our relative if we have too grand a party .
Oh , I'll rest here forever .
She's cold .
Therefore , the fact that you're awake this early tells me you've been upset with some anxiety .
Virtue turns to vice if it's misused .
Where is she ?
Investigate how this foul murder came about .
I won't break this promise .
Have you had lunch yet ?
Gentlemen , can any of you tell me where I can find young Romeo ?
A dog from that house will make me angry enough to take a stand .
This is a pitiful sight !
Or , if you don't delay , make my wedding bed in the tomb where Tybalt lies .
That fair-skinned , hard-hearted hussy , Rosaline is going to torment him until he goes insane .
Romeo ?
Romeo ran away when Tybalt fell dead .
Oh no !
Hey , are you biting your thumb at us ?
I can tell you , but young Romeo will be older when you find him than he was when you started looking for him .
It's late .
Perhaps there's still some poison on them , to make me die with a medicinal kiss .
Oh , she shows the torches how to burn bright !
Your life insurance ?
Where ?
Saint Francis , help me !
Your answer is so strange !
Come , is the bride ready to go to church ?
I didn't see anybody use you for kicks .
Any man who knows how to write can answer a letter .
I think he told me Paris was about to marry Juliet .
Yes , this is what love does .
Don't worry about me .
So stay for a while .
It's almost morning .
What crimes happen so early in the morning that I have to wake up before the usual time ?
Girls who marry so young grow up too soon .
Goddammit !
I'll give him equal thanks , so we're even .
Now , I swear , I'm so angry that I'm shaking all over .
