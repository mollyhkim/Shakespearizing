You may have lost his respect , but so have I .
Calm down , calm down .
It's not fair to punish me for something you make me do .
Is Marcus Luccicos in town ?
Yes , I do , sir .
Take it back .
But that's another story .
Anyway , I have to say goodbye to you now .
I'm afraid we're intruding too boldly on your sleep time .
Let me go with you to Belmont .
If only all struggles ended this well .
I'm not talking about proof yet .
That's what I hear .
I'm done for .
But brother Anthony , Don't , it's no big deal .
Yes , here it is .
Say , isn't this the Latin master Cambio ?
He will be fooled into thinking he is greater than fate , he will mock death , and he will think he is above wisdom , grace , and fear .
A very clear way , but there is no friend who will undertake it .
God , not our strength , be praised !
The ghost is definitely something to worry about .
Very obedient , keep crying. , Concerning this , oh , what fake emotion ! , I am being ordered home , Get away from me , I'll send for you later. , Sir , I'll obey the order and return to Venice .
I'm whipped and tortured , May God give you a good evening .
And just in time , here he comes with Sir Richard Ratcliffe .
I second that
Hold on a second .
You're a traveler .
You certainly deserve it .
What , from myself ?
Love is so vivid and fantastical that nothing compares to it .
I will have when you hear the rest of what I have to say .
My soul is stuck to sin , and the more it struggles to break free , the more it sticks .
When good orators finish talking , they spit ; when lovers do ( God help us if they ever do ) , they kiss .
God will take revenge .
They finished their business with Pompey , and Pompey has left .
He commanded me to wake him up early .
The mayor is here at hand .
Where should I go ?
Nothing , except your true love for my lord .
I'll wear this one and none other .
It stands by her bedside .
Fair and noble hostess , we are your guests tonight .
I had business that made me late .
Won't we , Sir Andrew ?
What does my powerful master wish for ?
He turned away twice and almost left him there .
Because it will make you angry , and that will get me another beating .
Your shoes are in pretty bad shape .
Now I will have to send my humble proposal of peace to that young man .
You are all Lord of lords !
They're overdoing it .
Hope with good cause is swift ; it flies as fast as a swallow .
Not tonight , Iago .
Yes , if I know the language and the letters .
You are the best of the cutthroats .
My back aches too ,
Have a nice day !
And you saw how the beggar ran from the mutt ?
You can have a whole story , not just a word .
Brutus , may I have a word with you ?
Good shining , Moon ! , Really , the Moon shines very well .
It's a deal !
He's laughed at my losses , made fun of my earnings , humiliated my race , thwarted my deals , turned my friends against me , riled up my enemies , and why ?
I hereby declare we will have no more marriage .
Not a second more .
But the way he's divided the kingdom recently , nobody can tell which of the dukes he favors more .
Cousins , you all have work to do. , Oh , I beg your pardon .
I am not a child or an infant .
When the barrel's empty , we'll drink water .
Is it possible ?
I found Orlando under a tree , like a dropped acorn .
I wish he'd go away !
Alas , he is too young .
This is going to be great !
Please , remain seated .
If I weren't forbidden to tell you the secrets of
Draw your sword , scoundrel , or I'll slice your thighs like flank steak .
Now grit your teeth and let your nostrils flare .
No , it wasn't .
Why , no , boy .
It's about who I am , and how , why , and where this handkerchief was stained .
My lord , the mayor of London is here to greet you .
When you see a huge wheel rolling down a hill , you shouldn't try to hold on to it or it'll break your neck .
I hate him so much it makes me sick , and whoever can ruin his happiness will make me happy .
The only possibility is that you've murdered him .
This fight will decide who dies .
Shut up .
Yes , I do .
Unless you're talking about his love for this kind of foolishness , which , judging from his appearance , he has , he is no fool for love , as you pretend .
And tell the Dauphin his joke will look pretty stupid when thousands more weep than ever laughed at it .
She's Phoebe-ing me .
That is the key to long-lasting love .
Therefore , dear Isis , do the right thing and give him the fortune he deserves .
She will not come .
How can I help you , sir ?
No , I said his horse is coming , with him on its back .
Tomorrow is the day .
You would take it back ?
When I raise my hand , you do the same , and bring it down on Gonzalo's head .
Your sweet brother wanted to come meet you , but his mother wouldn't let him .
Monster , I'll kill this man .
What have you got on your head ?
Take this !
That's a good point .
Oh , Julius Caesar , you are still powerful .
But constant expression of wild grief will only make it tame , so I'm not going to say any more about my boys until I've gouged your eyes out with my bare hands .
Now I've done a good day's work .
What's that trumpet ?
I'll go with you , my lord , if you'll allow me .
My father and mother coupled when the demonic moon was descending , and I was born under the Big Dipper , so it's inevitable that I'm rude and oversexed .
We want answers .
We'll do it .
Wait good Nurse .
Mutton ?
What's done is done .
I don't know where he's staying , so if I told you he's sleeping here or there , I'd be lying .
I hope heaven protects him from the weather , because I lost sight of him on the stormy sea .
Curse your families !
Please , come to his house with me .
It's strange that you haven't heard .
If you really are Sir Rowland's son , as you've just whispered to me , and I can absolutely see the likeness in your face , you are truly welcome here .
Is your little pearl in there ?
I'll follow after you .
Scum !
Did you see how he laughed about sleeping with her ?
Well sir , they've lied ; moreover , they have said things that were not true ; secondarily , they are slanderers ; sixth and lastly , they have falsely accused a lady ; thirdly , they have confirmed things that did not in fact happen ; and , in conclusion , they are lying scoundrels .
If he's reluctant , I can convince him .
The king has bet six Barbary horses , and he has prepared six French rapiers and daggers with all their accessories .
Then you might as well say they're not dead .
My soul depends on it , A thousand times good night .
It's nothing , my lord .
But please , tell me : is he coming home ?
I am their aunt , and I love them like a mother .
But jealous people don't think like that .
Greed has been the downfall of many kings .
I beg your pardon , sir , What did that guy say ?
Ely joining Richmond troubles me more than Buckingham and his quickly assembled army .
I don't think so !
My lord , they're waiting for you to give your daughter away to Claudio .
But you can't see where you're going , sir .
How did you tolerate prison ?
Then she ran away to grieve alone .
Oh , dear God , don't let me go mad !
As for my daughter Katherine , this much I know : she's not for you , more's the pity .
Did he ask about me ?
But fire also gives off light , and fire will burn you .
It doesn't excuse your cruel behavior .
An excellent motion .
Well , Oswald ?
Let's seek out some shady place where we can sit down alone and cry our hearts out .
Honest , yes , honest .
Oh , you idiot !
With God's help .
What are you waiting for , lords of France ?
He'll think these letters are from Olivia and that she's in love with him .
Caesar ?
He fell down in the marketplace and foamed at the mouth and was speechless .
They haven't been commanded to go to the west , mighty king .
Very wise .
And , if you need to , approach the subject of me : tell them that when my mother became pregnant with the insatiable Edward , my noble father was fighting in France .
For when you cut your shin .
No .
Well , when I cut the egg in half and eat the whites , the yolk will be in two parts like two golden crowns .
This is pure insanity .
How many things in life seem good to us because of when they happen !
Doesn't the sun shine palely down on them , as though in contempt , killing their fruit with frowns ?
Finally , the ceremony done , he called for wine .
Shall I be your slave ?
Everything would be produced without labor , and would be shared by all .
Let any man perish who isn't ready now !
It means being full of sighs and tears , like I am for Phoebe .
Cesario is my name , your servant's name , fair princess .
Still the same old Cassius !
Yes , and he'll keep getting funnier till he dies .
I can suck sadness out of a song the way a weasel sucks eggs .
Fast work and a little luck are all I need. , Brother , could I have a word with you ?
That way I can conquer my own fear and sleep easy at night .
And I regret having bragged to the messenger about how my enemies were being butchered at Pomfret while I , as I said , was in good standing with Richard .
Macbeth has come .
No , don't even mention him .
Of course , they won't believe you without proof .
It never ceases to amaze me the way people ignore the correct , traditional principles and rules of war .
Signor Antonio ?
When did she send you ?
One servant cried , "God bless us ! " and the other replied , "Amen , " as if they had seen my bloody hands .
I've been transformed somehow , haven't I , master ?
I wander everywhere faster than the moon revolves around the Earth .
I know the sound of his walk. , Die , villain !
Yeah , that would get every single one of us executed .
Here in Verona there are girls younger than you , girls from noble families , who have already become mothers .
How old is she ?
From my kind uncle , who I know will give it to me , especially as it's not worth much .
For the love of God , call a doctor !
Please let her speak .
What's this ?
Come here .
They're never jealous for a reason ; they're just jealous .
Fa , sol , la , mi .
I admit that he's murderous , lecherous , greedy , lying , deceitful , violent , malicious , and guilty of every sin that has a name .
I'm not marvelous , sir , but I'm certainly a maiden .
And just try to remember a few rules of life .
But regarding what happened between us , don't ask , I can't tell you .
Biondello , go and tell your mistress to come to me .
Oh , not you again .
Neither ?
No , none that you're smart enough to make .
Good morning , old Sir Thomas Erpingham !
He's furious because you insulted him , and he has a right to satisfaction .
Are you going to pay the eight shillings I won from you in a bet ?
There is a poor old man who , purely out of love , has limped after me for miles .
Madam , his majesty asks for you , and for you , Duke of Gloucester , and for you , my noble lords .
We still have time to get all of this done before daybreak .
I can read .
The devil's advice is nicer .
Then we'll go out , even to the marketplace , and , waving our bloody swords over our heads , let's cry , "Peace , freedom , and liberty ! " Kneel then , and wash .
Look at Macbeth , he's in a daze .
Give me your blessing .
Oh , that arrow was well shot .
I know you .
Don't simply hide your hatred .
I didn't do anything wrong that I know of , unless it was a sin to defend myself when someone attacked me .
They are here at court now , and I believe they've been told to give a performance for him tonight .
He'll just think an idiot wrote it .
Yes , but not out of fear .
What's going on these days ?
He's serious .
Don't you agree that we owe it to him to tell him about this , out of duty and love ?
It's a shame that we eagles are caged up while the vultures are free to do whatever they please .
Here's another , stronger than the first .
A thin face , which you don't have ; a sleepless , sunken eye , which you don't have ; an irritable temper , which you don't have ; a neglected beard , which you don't have , but that might not be so telling , since you don't have much beard anyway .
followed you on your sad wanderings , ever since your bad luck began .
Welcome back !
I'm going to rest my head on this little slope .
Sure , since beauty's power can more easily change a good girl into a whore than the power of goodness can change a beautiful girl into a virgin .
They did , Fluellen .
Murder !
I know you are loyal and honorable .
But since the affairs of men are always uncertain , let's think about the worst that may happen .
Look and see .
And then Pyramus showed up .
She was your boot-wearing mistress and your warrior lover , and now that she's getting married to Theseus , you've come to celebrate their marriage .
Who's shouting ?
My wife's coming .
How dare you talk about kindness or shame .
Honest Iago's arranged that .
Instead , lend it to me as your enemy .
No , he hasn't .
What handkerchief ?
What a miserable and obstinate fellow this king of England is , to blunder with his fat-headed followers so far beyond his capacity .
Don't pardon that .
And you've come at a good time , so you can convey my greetings to the senators and tell them I won't come today .
That light we see is coming from my hall .
Cupid , that blind bastard son of Venus , conceived from a thought and anger , born from insanity , that blind , naughty boy who makes everyone else go blind just because he can't see himself , let Cupid judge how deep my love runs .
Why are you crying ?
I was engaged to both of them .
Less than a month after my father's death , even before the tears on her cheeks had dried , she remarried .
Oh , traitors , villains !
Macbeth is ripe for the picking .
The heavens are being stingy with their light .
It means being filled with fantasy ; with passion and wishes ; with adoration , loyalty , and devotion .
He's too good to have any compassion for you .
We must form a better opinion of ourselves if our uprising can pull the insatiable Antony's attention away from that Egyptian widow .
There are rats and thieves and pirates , not to mention storms , winds , and rocks .
Tell him my fury will abate , and I'll take the crowns .
I don't have a talent for putting my heart's feelings into words .
What's it to you ?
I humbly thank you .
But it can't help either !
The name of Cassius gives credit to these corrupt actions , and so they go unpunished .
He just said that they're no good at acting .
Yes , but that makes me love you even more .
By our Lady , I think that's true .
You may really be honest , no matter what I think .
Here is his Majesty .
If the witches tell the truth , which they did about you , maybe what they said about me will come true too .
I must hide in the darkness for awhile .
Take good care of him .
He's very bright .
The Prince has made the match , and may God bless it .
She was filthy !
Now you're talking .
I'll give you a greater gift than that , nephew .
You sound like a cattle dealer : that's the way they sell bulls .
What in the world do you call this , tailor !
Do you think fiery fever can be put out by the windy puff of titles ?
So find someone younger to love , or you won't be able to maintain your feelings .
That tree could be called God's tree , since it drops such wonderful fruit .
That it was , sir .
Or , if you don't mind , come to my home , and I'll wait for you .
But listen to me ; let me guide you .
Get going now .
Play me some music .
Give my regards to Hastings , Catesby .
But where is Kate ?
Wait , Tybalt , wait !
I am bound by oath , so please forgive me .
I don't know him .
Retreat further , my lord , retreat further .
Refusing to fight him at sea won't disgrace you .
That's a nice hand you dealt me .
If it does pass , the Church will lose more than half of what it possesses , because the bill would strip us of enough real estate left to the church by wealthy , pious men in their wills to support fifteen earls and fifteen hundred knights , six thousand two hundred squires , and a hundred well-supplied almshouses for the relief of lepers , old-age pensioners , the poor , and those too weak or sick to work .
Around nine o'clock , madam .
I'll do my best , madam .
Duke , please go ahead with your state business .
I don't like her name .
Oh , noble weakness !
No , definitely not !
I don't know why I should be afraid , since I haven't done anything wrong .
And then ?
Go after her , go .
Six Barbary horses , six French swords with accessories , and three imaginatively designed carriages , sounds like a French bet against the Danish .
And could you please take my servant to old Shylock's house ?
What do you mean ?
What friend ?
Take away the stools , the sideboards , and the plates .
Well then , he's God's soldier now !
Hurry , go !
Yes , look , it's true that children are punished for the sins of their fathers .
If your master wants a queen to beg from him , you should tell him that a queen will beg for no less than a kingdom .
Hey , Mountain , hey !
There was never a mother who suffered so much loss .
Is the king dead , the empire dispossessed ?
She's sending this ring back to you , sir .
Oh God , I wish the two of them were alive and living in Naples , as king and queen !
Will you come ?
You have to pretend to be your niece's father , and give her away to Claudio .
He knows what ?
Be there , or don't show your face again .
Armed forces have already landed .
What seems sweet to him now will soon turn bitter .
Give him room .
Are you thinking about me ?
It was addressed to him , and orders must be obeyed .
Very good !
You barely have the heart to tell me , so you can't possibly have the nerve to do it .
I have done wrong , so I will suffer wrong .
If there's any doubt , there is no doubt .
For the sake of our old friendship , I ask you , hold my sword handle while I run on it .
Oh , madam , my old heart is broken , broken .
Death didn't conquer
Even more since you annexed my father's house and lands .
After you .
Her fallow fields are overgrown with weeds , while the blade that should uproot such wilderness lies rusting .
Relent , and save your souls .
I'll go to the hole to see if I can hear my Thisbe's face .
Show .
Listen , listen !
And bring the ship's captain to the castle .
End it , then , and everything is over. , Eros ! , I'm coming , my Queen ! , Eros ! , Wait for me .
What a fine sight !
From the Earth's womb , many different sorts of plants and animals come forth , and the Earth provides her children with many excellent forms of nourishment .
Your parents are lucky to have such a lovely child .
I just saw your father the Lord Gloucester and notified him that the Duke of Cornwall and his wife Regan will stay with him here tonight .
Hearts can not think it , tongues can not speak it , meas-urements can not calculate it , scribes can not write it , bards can not sing it , and poets can not make verses about it .
Lord Gloucester has helped him leave .
Come on .
Stay in your cabins .
Come , firebrands , over here !
And I'd be surprised if he even did that , for he prefers sports , fun , and friends .
Get away from here and leave me .
But since , To get back to the matter at hand , what do you think of our proposal ?
Therefore , you should obey their wishes .
And then she brought me up , and I thank her for that , too .
I'm now sure that every bump in the road has been removed .
First of all , Pyramus has to take out a sword to kill himself , which the ladies in the audience won't be able to stand .
When powerful kings cave in to flatterers , do you think loyal men will be afraid to speak out against it ?
That's for sure .
Silence !
She had put a wreath of fresh , fragrant flowers around his hairy forehead , and the drops of dew that lay in the center of the flowers made the flowers look like they were crying with shame to be decorating the head of that ugly jackass .
For what ?
Most powerful lord , my mistress Cleopatra sent me to you .
You want proof ?
He has an uncle here in Messina who will be glad to hear this news .
The king is coming .
Roderigo !
I tell you , I'm as sane as any man in Illyria .
Go !
I'll poison you , or beat you with a club , or stab you with a sword .
You are right , it's for my mistress .
Let's go to the king .
If it is , I suggest you don't eat it .
Thank God , thank God !
Come on , please sing .
I wish you'd be patient .
Let's be light-hearted .
But aren't you drowned , Stephano ?
That is , if we ever want to return to being rivals for Bianca's love .
Husbands need to know that their wives are human beings too .
It's strange , strange .
Now you sound like a man .
It's a subject as worthy of endless discussion as the changing sea .
It's getting there .
You're the one I have to obey .
Answer that question .
Nothing , my lord .
These are tricks .
There's no point in looking for him if he doesn't want to be found .
Once more I come to ask you , King Harry , if you're ready to negotiate your ransom before your certain defeat .
Well , eventually God will send him some more hair , if he thanks Him .
How many infatuated people go mad with jealousy !
Where's the cook ?
You're talking about killing ?
I'll come too .
He doesn't seem to be alive .
You may change your mind later .
How can you ever hope for mercy for yourself , when you don't give any now ?
I didn't accuse you of lying .
Even their clothes are unstained , and look fresher than before the storm .
Madam , that young man out there says he's got to speak to you .
Which one is it ?
Really , I think your other ruff is better .
Ruining his meals , his enjoyment , and his sleep would drive any man or beast mad .
You see me here , gods , a grieving old man , as wretched in his grief as he is in his old age .
Now come along .
Are you scared ?
That's true , it's your beauty's fault .
First , I ask you what they've done ; thirdly , I ask you what offense they're charged with ; sixth and lastly , I ask you why they've been committed here ; and , in conclusion , I ask what they're accused of .
What is your name ?
I wouldn't change my mind even if she were
Good evening , brother .
Why don't you have a seat , your highness ?
Well , when Nature makes a person beautiful , can't Fortune make her fall into a fire , thereby making her ugly after all ?
Are you going riding this afternoon ?
They've made many raids upon Italy , and the naval patrols go pale at even the thought of resisting them .
Take me to him .
Oh , monstrous !
You'll never find her without an answer unless you find her without a tongue .
Oh , I wish you weren't , you poor , frightened soul .
But their trick failed .
He's like a cowardly
I'll call it "Bottom's Dream" because it's so deep that it has no bottom .
Please , try to act a little more serious , or the people in Belmont will get the wrong impression about me , and your wildness will make me blow my chance with Portia .
Who comes with him ?
Then tomorrow we'll find that they feel only like eating , not like fighting .
Soldier , you are .
I know what I'll do .
Sir , Octavius has already arrived in Rome .
I swear that nothing anyone can say will change my mind .
Will he tell us what that pantomime meant ?
With all my heart. , Three or four of you go welcome him. , In the meantime , I'll read Bellario's letter out loud .
I'll go look for him , Cassio , stay around here .
My words would bounce her to my sweet love , and his words would bounce her back to me .
Yes , dear little chick , come along with me. , Shut up , man !
He's got my vote as I die .
The spirit is torturing me .
You mournful princes and grieving gentlemen who have been sharing this burden of grief , now it's time to cheer each other up with love .
And have I ever seemed less than modest or appropriate to you ?
Calm down .
And that will save a partridge wing from being eaten , because he'll be too miserable for dinner .
It's always dangerous when little people get caught in the crossfire of mighty opponents .
Think about the ones who have died .
I love you as a child should love her father , neither more nor less .
It is an honor that I do not dream of .
I'll bet anything you like that nothing will happen , once again .
Let go of it !
I'm sorry I said anything .
You're right , sir .
Give me what I deserve , and do your duty !
Since she belongs to me , I can do what I want with her , as the law says : I can either make her marry Demetrius , or have her killed .
But in loving me , you would love the friend of France , for I love France so much that I will not part with a single village of it .
Bless your heart .
My liege .
We found him in the churchyard .
No , my lord , your polite words are not to the point .
Wait , Petruchio , I should go with you .
Not now , my sweet Desdemona .
She is so generous , kind , and ready to help that she thinks it's wrong not to do everything she can , even more than she is asked to do .
If he hears you , you'll make him angry .
Be lenient , dearest !
Whether I go ahead with them or not is completely up to you .
Go now , Lord Constable and all you princes , and quickly bring us news of England's defeat .
But since you come from him , you're saturated with his healing spirit .
I like him very well .
You were never with me for anything if you weren't there for the goose .
Where's the evidence against me ?
Caesar , I have news about Menecrates and Menas , notorious pirates who prowl the sea in a variety of ships .
I'll leave you without revealing any emotion , like a man of steel .
Yes , I'll grant you that .
What did I do ?
Now all my enemies are at my mercy .
Your father !
Yes , that's the way I'll do it .
So you'd better not stay with him , Antony .
Have you come from Bellario's office in Padua ?
This guy has legs like a man but fins for arms !
Oh , for Pete's sake !
Here , drink to me .
You're not asleep yet , sir ?
Here .
I really want to sleep now .
If that's true , then don't be tongue-tied .
I won't say no to you , but let it be known that I'm only doing this after a lot of persuasion and to save your life , I hear you were quickly wasting away without me .
Stillness and nighttime are perfect for beautiful music .
I'll be there shortly .
I hear some noise .
Is this the madman ?
Absolutely , so long as he gets the girl .
Well , I won't take it any longer .
What did I do wrong ?
Yes , it is .
That's enough .
So , possessing neither a voice nor a heart for flattery , I can't awaken the spirit of love in her so as to make him appear in his true likeness .
It is , my lord .
Who's that ?
Delighted to stay ?
We'll figure out the best time and safest route to avoid being found out by my father's guards , whom he'll send out as soon as he discovers I've gone .
Either I had to ruin you , or you would have ruined me .
I want to take the love I had for my cousin and take it out on the body of the man who killed him .
Oh , I'm out of breath from this foolish chase .
I'll show you how .
I'll read it. , It looks so unlike Portia !
And I followed him because I loved him .
I myself heard the king say he would not be ransomed .
Exactly how long is that , do you think ?
Well , then it will be dry .
Dreams are a sign of ambition , since ambition is nothing more than the shadow of a dream .
If I may say so , your Majesty , your famous grandfather and your great-uncle Edward , the Black Prince of Wales , or so I've read in the history books , fought a very brave battle here in France .
Well , if you were never at court , you were never exposed to good manners ; if you never witnessed good manners , your manners must be wicked ; wickedness is a sin , and committing sins leads to damnation .
Remember the reward we're getting when the deed's done .
Oh , so cruel !
My lord , I don't know what's going on , but it seems to me that your highness isn't being treated as politely as before .
I'm ready now to hear what my good cousin the Dauphin has to say , for I hear that the greeting you bear is from him , not the king .
They're louder than the storm or us sailors .
Agreed .
Hush , Hortensio .
Where's your servant
This speech is going on too long .
She says all the right things , but the dumbest brothel-keeper would tell the same story .
Lord Mayor , the reason we have sent , Look behind you !
Someone knocks .
If you steal my money , you're just stealing trash .
How did you get better ?
Why are you silent ?
Do I ask you to follow me ?
But God forgive me for bragging .
Let the envoy from Antony come in .
Oh , if I've got any influence over you at all , please patch things up with him .
Your speech is more refined than I would expect in such a remote place as this .
Should I blab to her that you're coming ?
First let's go to dinner .
Where have Come here , boy .
Calm down , Smulkin , you fiend !
Stay warm .
It's incredible , they didn't say a word .
God bless your Grace !
The son ran away .
Excuse me , sir , do you know anything about this ?
I couldn't pay my debt to the Jew on the due date .
Take my advice .
Forgive my boldness if I take you up on your words about making magic .
She hangs around me all the time .
Ready to set sail , sir ?
He claimed he knew that , and that's why he's come to speak with you .
The Lord in heaven bless you , noble Harry !
Go !
Those who were bitter enemies of your father in his time have turned their bitterness to sweetness , serving you loyally and wholeheartedly .
Is that possible ?
Now he's ready for
She's gone .
The English have promised me thousands of troops .
Don't say that .
Yes , for three months .
I can not speak your England .
Well , girl , you're weeping not for his death as much as for the fact that the villain who killed him is still alive .
Yes , my lord .
My lord the ruler of Burgundy , I'll speak to you first .
Either here or at the Capitol .
No .
By the way , I don't want anyone thinking I'm drunk .
Most sweet lady , Oh , "sweet" !
Can I have a word with you privately ?
Here , Peter Quince .
Please don't take my niece the wrong way , sir .
I must go to his house and tell his wife that he came bursting into my place like a lunatic and stole my ring .
It's this servantlike mentality that's keeping you unmarried .
You and your servant are very funny , sir .
Stop .
Don't worry , I won't .
But why do you keep me here so long ?
Why don't you answer me , man ?
Who am I then ?
Because when rich villains need poor villains ' services , those poor ones can name the price .
They saw him just now as mad and deranged as the stormy sea , singing loudly , wearing a crown of nettles , thorns , hemlock , and all the other weeds that grow in our cornfields. , Send out a hundred soldiers to find him .
I'd rather be a peddler .
Alas , you don't know .
These crisscrossing laces do cut off the circulation in my legs a bit , but who cares ?
But I'm ashamed to kiss , sir .
Let me deal with this .
I will my lord , as fast as I can .
He's pale and hyperventilating , as if a bear were chasing him .
I will accept no apology until experts in matters of honor show me how to make peace with you without staining my own reputation in doing so .
You must be mistaking me for someone else , sir .
Come , night .
Either my eyesight is failing me , or you look pale .
No , not sure ones when we're talking about something unsure .
How is it that you've come back so soon ?
Well , God is responsible for that , not me , and he deserves thanks .
I don't understand why they're all here together .
So let's see it .
Do you smell something naughty ?
But since this has happened , you should fix it for your own good .
Do you mean the king ?
Is this the same Moor whom the senate considers so capable ?
I know what you'd do .
Let me see it .
You fell from the terrifying top of this chalk cliff .
Offer yourself more respect , or , not to beat this word to death , you'll offer me the chance to be a laughing-stock .
I have to do these things before I have a chance to think about them .
Good morning , Prince ; good morning , Claudio .
Your answer ?
Your love's name is Rosalind ?
Tell me , who is this knight ?
Go ahead .
Yes , that's it !
She thinks I'll marry her because she loves me .
I'm not afraid of dead uncles .
Should we just get down to it ?
Oh , that's a joke made out of leather that spreads itself thin , from the width of an inch to as fat as a yard .
I'll follow you and turn this hell I'm in into a kind of heaven .
Yes , " said my husband , "Did you fall on your face ?
He's praying now .
That's a nice hat you've got there .
Even if you were as handsome as I beg your highness' pardon .
It's absolutely true , so take good care of it .
I didn't .
Who knows what the Lord Protector thinks ?
Then we can let this ambitious tyrant continue unchallenged until each of us is killed at his whim .
Though he seems a little old-fashioned , there is much care and courage in this Welshman .
I'll think over what you've said , I'll listen patiently to whatever else you have to say , and I'll find a good time for us to discuss further such weighty matters .
Oh Stephano , do you have any more of that wine ?
Oh no , my reasons are deep and as permanent as death .
Is the single man lucky , then ?
The guilty speak volumes even when they're silent .
Does that necessarily mean you should love his son ?
I thought your heart had been wounded by a lion's claws .
Or , if he wrote down his thoughts , give me his letter .
What in the world made you risk your reputation like this and become a street brawler ?
Your praise has beaten you home .
Oh , has it come to this ?
Who's there ?
Sir Topas , Sir Topas !
Did he cry ?
We heard that once you were served eight wild boars roasted whole for breakfast , for only twelve people !
What's this ?
How are you , my love ? , Demetrius and Egeus , come with us .
As I remember , this should be the house .
We'll see them immediately .
What would you like to see ?
Wow , we're really going to drive him crazy .
Here's more insanity for us .
Tybalt , old Capulet's nephew , has sent a letter to Romeo's father's house .
Who's there , in the other devil's name ?
I'll hold on to your money and leave you for an hour .
Madam , your mother wants to talk to you .
It's dangerous out there .
Do I have the asp's poison on my lips ?
You had a Clarence , too , and Richard killed him .
My Italy is full of civil war .
We'll meet you at sea .
The general should be informed about this .
Don't you know , master , that some men's best qualities do them in ?
Indulge us further and supplement our performance with your own imaginings .
Can someone fall in love this quickly ?
Really , he won it from me once before in a dishonest game of dice .
Are you biting your thumb at us ?
The leftovers from the funeral dinner made a convenient wedding banquet .
Actually , their hearts are as sensitive and loyal as ours are .
I told him what I thought .
It would be excellent if they could make a man halfway between Don John and Benedick .
Hail , king !
Have you spoken to him ?
My sword and I will earn our place in history .
We don't doubt it .
Hello , sir .
She stood and spoke .
She shall not .
My king says this : "Tell Harry of England : though we appeared dead , we were only asleep .
He's afraid to come in .
It's him , it's him .
In an instant we were separated from them , as if in a dream , and brought here in a daze .
Thank you , and God bless you for your hospitality .
Why have you come here in such a mob ?
How did they die ?
They're really being spoken , sir , and they're true .
I'm not insane , Sir Topas .
Well , Petruchio , all this is very encouraging .
Seriously , though , son Petruchio , I think you have the most thoroughgoing shrew of us all .
What's my name ?
Yes , by God !
Well , we can put away our pipes and go home .
We came into the world as brother and brother , so now let's enter hand in hand , not one before the other .
I understand now .
Madam ?
Try again .
I never felt it until now , two thousand ducats in that diamond , and other precious , precious jewels !
Come , here's some sauce to go with it .
Where are the thousand
Me too , otherwise I would have had to duel with Claudio .
I must go attend Caesar .
Oh , noble prince , I can tell you everything about the unfortunate circumstances of this deadly fight .
You think I care what I'm called ?
The whole world is a stage , and all the men and women merely actors .
Your delicacies aren't worth as much to me as your welcome is .
I think Alexander the Great was born in Macedon .
I told him that your father was in Venice , and that you expected him to arrive in Padua today .
Why , sir , you know this is your wedding day .
Now he won't give me either .
I look forward to getting to know you better , Mr. Mustardseed .
Well , should we head to the Tower ?
Watch out , Ophelia .
An angel is walking on earth .
I swear , I don't like the look of you .
Instead , hide your true face behind smiles and friendliness .
Is Othello angry ?
It's a big deal to you .
If you think about it correctly , Caesar has suffered a great wrong .
Look how politely it's pointing you to a place that's farther away .
I tell you , you would find the rituals of war and , I promise you , its ceremonies and its solicitudes and its forms and its gravity and its discipline all to be quite counter to all this noise .
I know the glove is a glove .
You threw it at her rudely , and she wants you to take it back .
Claudio !
I wish I were , so I could deprive you of both day and life .
Why couldn't you be attended by my servants , or by Regan's ?
Listen a minute .
Well , at least that's something .
You know , if you were anyone other than Brutus , that speech would be your last .
I must be gone .
Yes , if the devil tempts you to do good .
There was a time when I would have been terrified by a shriek in the night , and the hair on my skin would have stood up when I heard a ghost story .
Indeed , Hero herself can !
Grumio , get me my horse .
Now my friend Petruchio will help me out , presenting me to old Baptista as a schoolmaster for Bianca well-versed in music .
Well , we've missed the beginning ; it's dead and buried .
Don't tell me that .
Let's go inside and we'll answer all your questions truthfully .
And I see a lot of Orlando here .
Leave , you little man .
Your two sons ?
In the meantime , be patient .
Any trick that works is good for me .
Come on in , tailor .
I did that and more , which brings me to the point of this second meeting .
I have promissory notes from Florence that I have to deliver .
So use your discretion .
Wasn't he born from a woman ?
You're better off because of your friends .
We've driven him all the way back to his camp .
Now in the factory of thought , create the image of all London pouring forth into the streets .
Look , sir , here comes the lady walking toward my cell .
I swear , she's a very good-natured lady .
Think about it carefully .
But first , I have to tell you that Desdemona's completely in love with him .
How short am I ?
Yes , yes .
Are you Sebastian ?
If you're just insane , then get out of here .
I'm speaking for the king , but I look like myself .
Don't deceive me .
I never gave him reason to be jealous .
What handkerchief ?
He stole it from me .
Good night , Pompey .
What did you think about that French lord , Monsieur le Bon ?
If not , you can kill me .
Try to get him to do that .
There's hardly a bush for miles around .
Leave her to God and her own guilt .
And you will be , or some people here will suffer for it .
My lord .
I know you have no choice .
It has leaked out that you're hiding here .
And what would that accomplish ?
And mine say a hundred and forty .
What's the news ?
He did this in public ?
What does this mean ?
I'll reward you once for your cheerfulness and ten times for your courage .
Your servants are waiting .
None of these deranged rascals can shake me from my profession .
Brother , Duke , please have some food .
She has been in a man's bed .
You have the best sorts of happiness to enjoy .
are you going to let them break me out of jail ?
Is there such a place ?
Get me out of here !
Oh , noble fool !
The meat was fine if you wanted to eat it .
Look at me crying , what a fool I am to cry at what makes me happy .
Bring ink and paper , Charmian .
Goodbye , you dumb old spirit .
How are you , my ladies ?
Tell me .
Farewell , everyone .
No more of these thoughts .
If you want to make me happy , don't wish yourself harm .
Get out of my sight .
Everybody knows I'm a nice piece of flesh .
Please , I'm asking you , go ahead and get back to your state affairs .
The clock says it's daytime , but dark night is strangling the sun .
He lets the bird hop a little from his hand and then yanks him back by a string .
But it was also prophesied that the crown would not go to your descendants , and that my sons and grandsons would be kings instead .
I like you very much .
I'm not scared of you .
Then we'll be stuffed with news .
Where else should his eyes be , if not in his head ?
Didn't you figure out that I left you because I hate you ?
If you're smart , you'll go home .
My father , I think I see my father .
Really , I had no intention of going for my sword .
Stop , for God's sake !
When will he be here ?
I was killed in the Capitol .
My own ears heard it , and you know it .
Is there anything inaccurate in that ?
But as a gentleman and a soldier he's promised me he won't hurt you .
Let's look in his pockets .
I'm beginning to understand what you want me to do .
Destiny chooses when you'll die and who you'll marry .
No , he was wicked and vile .
Ride out to the horsemen on that hill .
You're pale and trembling .
Ha , ha , ha !
Oh , I'm very scared something awful has happened .
It will be made even heavier soon , by the weight of a man .
You're older than me .
When he raised his arm in command , the world trembled .
If you could only hear this testament , which , excuse me , I don't intend to read aloud , you would kiss dead Caesar's wounds and dip your handkerchiefs in his sacred blood , and beg for a lock of hair to remember him by .
Strike !
We were about to have our noses snapped off by two old men with no teeth .
Don't follow me .
Maybe we can benefit from the same chaos that has defeated us .
He's married to Octavia , madam .
Why did you leave the dining room ?
Have you heard any news of impending battle ?
Love cools off , friendships break up , and brothers become enemies .
Revenge !
Leave all the rest to me .
What is it , sir ?
Drunk ?
No , he has only a little beard .
How's my nephew doing , noble lord of York ?
I thought I heard a voice cry , "Sleep no more !
As king , I can not risk the danger he represents as he grows crazier by the hour .
Invite all my sad captains .
I did kill her .
Good afternoon , good gentleman .
He died like someone who had practiced how to toss away his most cherished possession as if it were a worthless a piece of garbage .
When such a great man dies there should be a thunderclap .
Oh , sweet mermaid , don't command me to drown myself in the flood of your sister's tears .
Tell us , Bottom .
But when our vices become habits , Oh , the sadness of it ! , the wise gods blind us , shade our better judgment , make us love our mistakes , and laugh as we strut to our ruin .
He is coming .
And don't say all of that yet .
Yes , and I'll keep crying a while longer .
Pretty , Cupid-like boys stood on either side of her , smiling and cooling her with multicolored fans , which seemed to fan the flames in her cheeks even as they cooled them , undoing what they did .
Very pleased to meet you , my lord .
The cold wind's still blowing through the hawthorn tree .
Oh , sir , the problem goes far deeper than you realize .
That's very strange .
I didn't take any more pains bringing this message than you took pains in thanking me .
Many men use that excuse to avoid giving gifts .
Girls who marry so young grow up too soon .
It won't be long before I'm back .
But ships are just fragile boards , and sailors are just men .
Look how lush and healthy the grass is !
Go on , wear your boots out !
Shake off sleep , which looks like death , and look at death itself !
I did .
Think about that , and about what followed afterward .
Yes , go ahead and moan , because you killed the sweetest , most innocent woman who ever lived !
My worthy lord , your noble friends miss your company .
Are any ships leaving tonight ?
Your darling ?
I'm headed for your niece , sir .
Do you love me ?
Tell me truthfully , do you love my sister ?
I know that my lady's going to end up hitting him .
If you struggle to bring down a tyrant , you will sleep peacefully when the tyrant is killed .
Get out !
Yes she has , and by keeping celibate , she wastes her beauty .
I'll do it .
And then I'll be the leader of pain , and maybe I'll lead you as far as death .
Have I done something to offend you without knowing it ?
My good friends , I'll see you tomorrow .
Sir , is it possible that a person could fall in love so suddenly ?
It applies to you as much as to me , my lord .
Think about it .
Why would you do that , my love ?
If it's for me , don't keep it from me .
If I can't do it myself , I'll find someone who can .
Do you hear , my friend ?
I'd rather die in a ditch in Egypt , and make it my gentle grave .
Hello , sir .
I'm afraid he'll punish me .
Sir , we came to see your father's funeral .
You're cold , cold , and you were never hot with lust .
Wait !
But goodbye .
So , tell me , assuming I win your daughter's love , what dowry would she bring to the marriage ?
For Juliet's sake , for her sake , rise and stand up .
I saw her , but I didn't notice her .
Have you snuck over here to watch the wrestling ?
What was that thing I saw moving away from you up on the cliff before you fell ?
So cheer up , there's still hope for you , man .
I like doing things the old-fashioned way .
I didn't order it .
Good morning to you .
It's shameful , and we have to make some changes right away .
Yes , and his relative , too .
Fate , do your work .
Perhaps you've learned from life and not from books .
I'm more anxious watching you fight than you are in the fight itself .
I'm coming .
I remember .
Within an hour , one of my men will come to you behind the abbey wall and give you a rope ladder .
Follow them straight to the cottage .
It's wrong , and I'm starting to realize I'm being cheated !
Instead , she puts flowers in the boy's hair and makes a fuss over him .
The duke of Exeter has held the bridge very gallantly .
No , it'd be a sin to think such a low thought .
Oh , one child is one too many !
I think it's later than that , sir .
Follow his chariot , like the greatest disgrace to your whole gender .
C'mon , make an effort .
What sickness did she die of ?
I'm not sure , my lord .
Do you have enough love for me to be patient when my bad temper , which I inherited from my mother , makes me forget how I should behave ?
You're overstepping your bounds now .
Can I have a word with you , Lucillius ?
As for the food , it will be served in covered dishes .
You'll beat me ?
Why do you go around in circles when you could get to the point ?
What captain do you serve ?
The man's going crazy .
Stop arguing and listen to my plans .
Listen to you , instructing me like a parrot would .
I'll give you more instructions later .
He builds our fires , gets our firewood , and does all kinds of useful things for us. , Hey !
Who brought it out here ?
If I live through this , I'll be good to you .
If you're the lady of the house , then it's true you're stealing your role , because what's yours to give away is not yours to keep for yourself .
I'm afraid of what they might encourage him to do , considering the state he's in .
Or was it just your whim , on your own initiative ?
Cheer yourself .
And does she have to die for this ?
She's probably right .
When he stands where I am and sees you there .
Here , madam : Translate .
Follow and see to it that nothing serious happens between them .
You're shaking with emotion .
God be with all of you , princes .
It doesn't matter .
Who can tell me who I am ?
You won't , then ?
No eyes in your head til there's money in your wallet ?
He's a good-looking young man , and there are a lot of people with him .
Are you going to provoke me ?
Let's go find that hussy , Fortune , and and mock her till she starts distributing her gifts more equally .
Your renowned uncle , Duke Menaphon , the famous soldier , brought me here .
One , so they can save the money they spent on hairstyling , and two , so that when their hair falls out it doesn't land in their dinner .
She's the devil .
I swear by my sword , Swear by your shield , too !
At least I've got some booze to comfort me .
If you'd like to talk tomorrow , I'll come to your home .
I wouldn't do it for a nice ring , or fine linen , or pretty gowns or petticoats or hats .
If he's never drunk it before , it'll help soothe his fever .
We've advanced too far .
So if we know that a man is a thief , should we try to arrest him ?
Here , take away the dish .
How can I help you ?
I was telling you he used witchcraft to take this island .
By his side lies the noble earl of Suffolk , York's comrade and equal in brave wounds .
Sir Toby would bet a fortune that I'm not smart , but he wouldn't bet two cents that you're not a fool .
But as soon as the sun rises in the east , my sad son comes home to escape the light .
No , no , no , no !
Another case : Hugh Capet , who usurped the crown from Charles the duke of Lorraine , sole male heir in a direct line from Charles the Great , passed himself off as heir to Lady Lingare , daughter of Charlemagne , who was the son of Lewis the Emperor ( who was the son of Charles the Great ) , in order to give his claim to the throne more validity ( though , in fact , the claim was completely false and worthless ) .
If you won't listen to reason , I'll have to die .
Pity the hand that shed this valuable blood .
Listen , Signor Bassanio , there's nothing to worry about .
Do you have it with you ?
I never saw a woman except her and Sycorax , my mother .
justice will be rewarded .
Oh , I remember that very clearly !
Wear both the ring and my heart , because both are yours .
Master Constable , you're going about this all wrong .
Good spirit !
Don't let her say I kept you .
What do you want ?
Yes , fashion is fashion .
Oh , Fate , come and cut the thread of my life .
Come here , you wretch !
Will you be my husband , then ?
How sweet it would be to actually have the woman I love , when merely thinking about love makes me so happy .
Is there anything else you wish ?
Farewell .
All women would be angry with you for doing it , even though I'm the only one who's hurt by it .
Who should now pay the price for Mercutio's life ?
There is much to be learned from these converts .
Oh , sirs , if I stirred your hearts and minds to mutiny and rage , I would offend Brutus and Cassius , who , you all know , are honorable men .
He wouldn't say that .
Yes , him , woman .
As for the Jew's contract , don't let it be a factor in your plans .
I've destroyed my reputation , a most shameful error .
If your love was anything like mine , and I'm sure that no man has loved as I love now , exactly how many ridiculous actions did your fantasizing lead you to ?
How late is it , lords ?
Be quiet , you are Antonio .
I can tell you , but young Romeo will be older when you find him than he was when you started looking for him .
Good night .
Sailors , sir .
Squabbling ?
A crow without feathers ?
I've changed my mind about that .
Don't be so quick to twist my meaning .
Get rid of your low-class trapping , " she said .
That's why they say love is a child .
Tell him to surrender .
He's an honest man who detests evil actions .
It's terrifying .
My songbird , we have beaten them to their beds .
Should be ?
Oh , he looks like a pathetic Sunday school teacher .
Let the dying fire shine a glimmering light throughout the house .
Only when they're dead can I start to count my gains .
They want to talk .
What's the news abroad ?
The Jew will have justice .
Nor living ones , I hope .
We'll chase 'em into their latrines .
Were you thinking of spending the night here ?
By eight o'clock .
Don't compare a woman's love for a man with my love for Olivia .
All right , I understand .
Baptista is a noble gentleman , one to whom my father is not completely unknown , and lovely as his daughter is , she is entitled to any number of suitors , myself among them .
When Caesar says "do this , " it is done .
They keep up Adam's profession .
What ?
Oh , what a wonderful new world , that has such people in it !
The strangers are all gone .
I think a story like that would win my own daughter over .
That's what I'm afraid of .
Every town and port is crawling with henchmen on the lookout , waiting to capture me .
And I'm telling you it was burnt and dried out .
Our troops are deployed tomorrow .
I'm sorry my noble brother is suspicious of me .
Isn't he getting funnier ?
You still haven't said anything incriminating .
Stop !
Well , whose is it ?
It might happen that these strange signs , the unusual terror of this night , and the urgings of his fortune-tellers will keep him away from the Capitol today .
Tell him so yourself , and see how he takes the news .
I do , Mark Antony .
Out , out , brief candle .
I know I'm not fooling myself , or letting myself get carried away by my imagination , because every clue points to the fact that Lady Olivia loves me .
Those who have known how bad things are here on earth .
God help you , foolish man .
Did I do anything good to myself ?
And if you're not as attentive in serving him as you used to be , that'll be good .
Knock , knock , knock !
There , take that , you scoundrel !
You'll get a bigger reward than you ever got delivering a letter before .
I say you're not .
Two hundred ducats .
Don't make me wait for dinner even a moment .
He's a good soldier too , lady .
How is your Highness ?
Now leave me alone , as I said .
With all of them at once : they work together to create such an entirely evil person that no good ever manages to enter the mix .
Forever and a day .
Our tattered navy has reassembled and set sail , as formidable as the sea itself .
I myself am playing the man in the moon , Well then , that's the biggest mistake of all .
Kings and noblemen served him .
Greetings , Caesar , my lord !
Go tell your generals to hurry their preparations .
Please , be cheerful .
Good girl , give it to me .
I can .
Be good enough to hear me out .
What blessed work , my king .
Therefore , love and tongue-tied simplicity can say the most even when they're saying the least , in my opinion .
Then run away .
Let me hear what Agrippa has to say .
Lady Olivia told her servant Malvolio to kick you out of the house .
This is the air , that's the glorious sun .
We
To put it plainly , I'm afraid I'm not quite sane .
Therefore , willingly and yielding .
I had put bitter wormwood on my breast as I was sitting in the sun , under the wall of the dovehouse .
Let's go offer up our lives
You always loved to tell me I couldn't do anything without being told .
You're trying to trick me , my lord .
You talk like a child , but you're very smart anyway .
This is Cinna .
And there were a hundred spooked women huddled together in fear who swore they saw men on fire walk up and down the streets .
Yes , if you kept them together and invested them .
Like hell !
Fury , Fury ! , Get over there , Tyrant , there .
I'll smear my face with filth , put on a loincloth , make my hair matted and tangled , and face the bad weather wearing almost nothing .
What is this ?
So were you .
It's late .
Go ahead and ask her .
She provides an excellent moral .
I hope to God we can make him happy and do him some good !
Hey , you !
In the fact that it's solitary , I enjoy it very much ; but in the sense that it's private , it's terrible .
Then give it a nice welcome , as you would give to any stranger .
Make your boasts come true , and I'll be thrilled .
I think that our father will leave here tonight .
I stretch my joke for that word "fat." If you add that word to the word "goose , " it shows that you are a fat goose .
Go , lad , and take them to the pantry .
Then the writer imitated the one I composed to my steed , for my horse is my mistress .
Charmian , did I ever love Caesar as much as this ?
I'm not a slut , I keep myself clean , but I thank God I am ugly .
I'm sorry .
You may hear about it soon .
Show .
Even if he were as important a man as the devil , as Lucifer or Beelzebub himself , he's required , see , your Grace , to keep his vow .
Is it that early in the day ?
Curse you for your false appearances !
What bond do we need other than that of discreet Romans who have said what they're going to do and won't back down ?
If we aren't relieved in an hour , we have to return to our barracks .
Oh yes , three thousand ducats .
If you dare to fight today , come to the field .
Will they see us ?
This is for your master's sake , not mine .
She says something , sir , but I will not repeat it to you .
But maybe by some fluke he was saved too .
Send the deed after me and I'll sign it .
Now I'll stand up .
Well , to be on the safe side , so I don't go back on my promise , I plan to get myself married to a wealthy widow within the next three days .
Where is Duncan's body ?
A worthy fool !
Only for poor men ?
We're in God's hands , brother , not in theirs .
I'd heard about my brother's plan and have been subtly trying to change his mind , but he's determined .
Get him to bed and make sure his wounds are treated .
My lord , my lord , I don't want to hear any more about it .
And I feel that I love her .
So , what's the news on the Rialto ?
Thirty-five or thirty-six of his knights met him at the gate , and together with some others they've set off for Dover , where they claim to have powerful friends .
Sir , I tell you that we are not .
Master Malvolio ?
Let's have the evidence .
Please pardon our brother Clarence .
No , he did not .
At this time of night ?
Why , my boy ?
I know that he'll be on our side .
Please don't play games .
They swore you did .
Poor imitation queen , why do you align yourself with this humpbacked spider when he's got you trapped in his deadly web ?
Oh , my liege , my wife died tonight .
When I left him , he was less than nine miles from here .
Like the wind , I must have the freedom to blast anyone I please , as fools do .
Here I'm kneeling to swear that if I ever did anything to destroy his love for me , either by thoughts or actions , or if I ever took pleasure in anyone else , or if I never did love him , or don't love him now , even though he tries to shake me off ,
Is it true , sir , that the Duke of Cornwall was killed as they say ?
I believe drink did all of this to you last night .
Lead me to where you're standing .
I'm a friend , a friend who knows you well .
Well , do your best .
Good night , good boy .
No , if you can't adjust to political changes , you'll suffer for it .
Farewell , sir .
I'll sleep over here .
Even her worst faults are charming , and holy priests bless her even when she acts the slut .
I've told her father , and he's given his permission .
Fill my cup , Lucius , until the wine overflows it .
Maybe he won't see me .
I hope you're lucky enough to hear the true story by sticking around .
Oh , dear !
Is he enough of a man to wear a hat and grow a beard ?
I haven't even heard a mouse squeak .
Tell him he's not going to speak with me .
Free from the bondage you are in , Messala .
You'll be my role model .
I'm well , and probably will be for a while , as I hear that four feasts are being prepared .
Where is that moron of a cook ?
Oh , and monsieur , be careful not to break the honey-sac .
I remember a jumble of impressions , but nothing distinctly .
Is this my prize ?
Get ready for the third hit , Laertes .
You swore to me when I gave it to you that you would wear it till you died , and that it would be buried with you .
Well , I don't .
And so she turns men inside out and never acknowledges the integrity and merit that a man has .
All I can hope for now is a share of the feast .
Enobarbus , Antony has sent you all your treasure , with generous gifts besides .
Locked in her tomb .
Why , so did you .
She dropped it carelessly , and , seizing the opportunity , since I was here , I picked it up .
I've been invited to supper , Jessica .
My name is Petruchio , son of Antonio , a man well known throughout Italy .
Imagine , when we talk of horses , that you see them planting their proud hooves in the soft earth .
I'll go call the watch .
What have you done ?
I have news , ma'am .
Speak plainly .
I'll listen to Brutus .
Could you tell me how near the enemy is ?
Why are you yelling at me so angrily ?
I'll bleed to death .
Go back again , to be beaten home again ?
Don't think I'm in love with him just because I'm asking about him .
Don't tempt me to suicide again .
What are you doing here alone ?
If I can trust my dreams , then some joyful news is coming soon .
Certainly , I did .
I'll straighten it , then play , Where's the Queen ?
They sing when they die .
Our closest relatives are the ones most likely to murder us .
My man Grumio !
He said my eyes and my hair were black and , now that I think of it , he scorned me .
Prepare the horses for your lady .
Only three so far ?
They can't move till you release them .
This is just a trifling matter here , sir .
If you'd been as wise as you were bold , With an old man's mature judgment , You wouldn't have had to read this scroll .
That's true , my lord .
Yes , my lord .
Young Prince Edward is still alive , what do you think I'm going to say next ?
In my bedroom window there is a book .
God protect you from tornadoes , evil stars , and diseases !
If her breath were as terrible as her words , she would kill every living thing from here to the furthest star .
Come talk to me about this .
Then they're cold friends to me .
That's worse .
Captain , I have a favor to beg of you .
Oh , he's a lovely gentleman !
Villain , you don't know the laws of God or of man .
There's plenty of time .
I know a thousand immature tricks like that , and I'll use them all .
Othello's career is over .
Get yourself to a
Have my brother-in-law's troops been mobilized ?
No , that's not it , it's because of what happens in the marriage bed .
Oh , my mistress , a villain has made a mockery of your love !
There , Leonato , take your daughter back .
I'm no more insane than you are , and I'll prove it .
Oh , and young men never die ?
Well gentlemen , we've heard our assignment .
You said the enemy wouldn't come down but keep to the hills and upper regions .
And what are you going to do after you've spent your money ?
Do you think so , spirit ?
You were worn with honor .
Come on , you can be as angry as any guy in Italy when you're in the mood .
Goodbye to my happiness !
Give me your hand .
It is not the custom for the maids in France to kiss before they are married , is that what she says ?
Oh , this is treachery !
It was a rough night .
Well , my good fellows , wait on me tonight .
If I ever have to ask you for something that will put your luck to the test , it'll be something difficult and terrible .
If you're a member of a divine spiritual order of men who forgive sins , and you say you're my friend , how do you have the heart to mangle me with the word banishment ?
Goneril , you know how much I love you , but still I have to say , Shush , please .
What would that be ?
I await justice .
Sing us a song .
Hey !
I've sent twenty people to look for you .
Now I'll go inside and write out a secret order to keep Clarence's brats out of sight and to forbid anyone whatsoever from seeing King Edward's sons .
What income , what profit does it bring in ?
Though this island may appear desolate ,
You'll become a wood salesman and buy nothing but clubs from me .
Is he married ?
This bigmouth jerk here , ( He'll still die by hanging , not drowning , even if every drop of water in the sea tries to swallow him .
Poison never landed on such an ugly toad .
What's this ?
That was a likely story , that you found it in your room and didn't know who it belonged to .
Then tell her my loving story in simple terms .
Do it .
I'll pull on these smaller legs .
Speak confidently .
As for Hamlet and his attentions to you , just consider it a big flirtation , the temporary phase of a hot-blooded youth .
I refuse to accept that .
You'll have to woo Bianca like the rest .
You can have what you want .
Only to be generous and give it to you once more .
No medicine in the world can cure you .
Come on .
Did you fall ?
Meanwhile , I'll get Sir Toby .
I hope that , after I tell you my news , you will think better of me .
Well then , sing a lullaby to your generosity : it'll nap until I come back .
Here are forty ducats .
Well done !
Oh , this is terrible !
Hello , sir .
We're overjoyed to see you sane again .
The three-beat rhythm is a good for dancing , and the church bells chime , one , two , three .
I swear I do .
Your I mean my daughter is my flesh and blood .
I'll give you mine .
The sight made me so sick I couldn't watch any more .
But now they rise from the dead with twenty fatal head wounds and push us off our stools .
The next bit of good news is that our ship , which we gave up for ruined only three hours ago , is as well-outfitted and seaworthy as it was when we first set sail .
Do you lie so low ?
Will we hear from you before bedtime , Catesby ?
And like I am for Rosalind .
So be careful .
If you refuse it , the whole country will regret it .
Let's not fight over this fellow .
Your mistress is a good mount .
Valentine's Day is over .
My creditors are getting mean .
Believe me , I'd rather have lost a purse full of gold coins .
God bless you .
Hold on , then .
It's true she looked at me a lot , in fact , she looked at me so much that she seemed distracted , and couldn't really finish her sentences very well .
You can't trust all the rumors .
I met Venus as she was with her son on her way to her home on Paphos , in a carriage pulled by doves .
Why ?
Farewell to both of you , dear teachers .
Believe what ?
Unless I've mistaken his battle flags , which I'm sure I haven't , his regiment lies at least half a mile south of the king's mighty army .
My father-in-law lives closer to the marketplace .
A two-hundred-year-old witch sewed it while she was in a fevered trance .
Please , sir , be patient .
Among the ten thousand the French have lost only sixteen hundred are mercenaries .
Now I've paid you back , Parthia , and gotten revenge for Marcus Crassus' death .
What's the matter ?
We're glad to see you .
Yes .
You look tired .
That will be a good thing .
Let's go greet him when he lands .
It's a friend of Antony's .
It's no time for jokes : sober up .
It's only four o'clock now .
This wicked son of mine confirms the prediction , son against father .
We are destined to be betrayed when we are born .
Do you know him ?
Know him ?
All of us have reason to mourn the dimming of our shining star the king .
I assure you , my man is as true as steel .
Tell me , Voltemand , what's the news from the king of Norway ?
Certainly .
I leave him in your care , but oh , if only I were still in his favor I could arrange for better care for him .
I wish them all safe trips home .
It's clear , every man must take responsibility for the manner of his own death .
If you prick us with a pin , don't we bleed ?
This is how the candle burned the moth .
I know when a man is on fire , he'll swear anything .
It would be inappropriate , dangerous , even , for me to be seen working against the Moor , as I would if I stayed .
Maybe you think that I think you're in love .
Saint Davy's Day has passed .
We would have liked to have heard your good advice , which has always been serious and helpful , at the council today , but we'll wait until tomorrow .
Capulet , you villain !
You understand ?
What's the treasure , uncle ?
How does she claim to own you ?
Only my free will , nothing else .
Well then , if I've ever thanked a man , I'll thank you now .
He'll run after her .
Oh , God help me !
Come over here , nurse .
Call my sister that .
You're mistaken about all that .
I'm hanging on every word .
What color , madam ?
Antony" was divided between her heart and lips .
You are too evil for words !
I'm not afraid of anyone but him .
My husband !
The reason is that it's what I want .
Humble greetings , great master !
Stay away for now , and good night , my sweet friend .
Your descendants will be kings , even though you will not be one .
There is no rest to be had in any bedroom where you are !
That's a good song .
I'm happy about that .
Because you gave me something for nothing .
In saving you I consider myself well paid .
Yes , I want it , and I'll get it .
If the job had been painful , I would not have come .
Come on , let's all go inside .
Isn't there a guard around ?
So hurry up , because we have twenty miles to cover today .
The Danes , the Germans , and the Dutch , come on , drink , drink ! , are nothing compared to the English .
It's nine o'clock .
Who greets me so early in the morning ?
What , Gertrude ?
My trusty servant , Ariel !
Hey monster , the spirit you've been talking about , the one you call harmless , has been playing tricks on us .
You'd have to be as lazy as a weed on the shores of I knew it !
Not old enough to be a man , but not young enough to be a boy .
You don't wish we had more help from England anymore , cousin ?
You're looking for Lord Hamlet .
Either be calm and polite or I'll drown you out with the music of war .
The king wishes to know if you want to play against him right away , or wait awhile .
He wants me dead .
Goodbye , good Mr. Love .
Wake up , sir , wake up .
That was the limit for me .
Hey , mistress !
Who do you think you are coming in here armed ?
All I'm saying is that strange things have been going on .
What's the news , my good friends ?
You need to leave to take care of your own business .
I can't promise that love won't transform me , but I can promise you this : until I truly fall in love , a woman will never make me act like such a fool .
Your fortunes are the same .
So , I won't .
Okay , who does it trot for ?
There was no end to his generosity .
There , where the torch is burning .
When did I Do you know where you are , sir ?
You and I have heard our fathers talk of another Brutus , your ancestor , who would've let the devil himself reign in his Roman Republic before he let a king rule .
Should we see what he thinks ?
The people fear me in the country and the town .
Sometimes she rides over a courtier's lips , and he dreams of making money off of someone .
If this logic works , that's great .
What do you mean , lady ?
My friend Antonio , all I can say is thank you .
Where's that music coming from ?
Well , he's alive .
Just a bit of my dry humor , sir .
Let thunder rumble !
He's not himself because he feels so ashamed .
No , not too upset .
I know her by her walk .
Emilia , go to the castle and tell Othello and Desdemona what happened. , Will you please go now ?
He hasn't told this to the king , has he ?
Treat them with honor and dignity .
Benvolio , who started this fight ?
Do they seem religious ?
No , my lord , it's been four months .
Tie him up like a thief and bring him here to me .
You should be ashamed of yourself , Satan , you liar !
Oh , sad day !
He's a good fellow , I can tell you that much .
Is she really that wonderful ?
Let it all go .
But they are dead , and you killed them , you slave of the devil .
Lead us , monster ; we'll follow .
Run off , go visit fairs and festivals !
I'll be off before you are .
I said she was .
Now I see the blood rushing to your cheeks .
What is your name , young man ?
Tell me , my good friend , what is that light over there ?
Me too .
Hopefully when I get married , I'll give my husband half my love and half my sense of duty .
I'll drink to her as long as there's a hole in my throat and booze in Illyria .
The thane of Fife had a wife .
I sense you're treating me like a child .
Why do you look so upset ?
I'll knock your teeth out , sir .
This is my treasurer .
The sweet fool in a fool's costume , that's me .
Come here , Sir Andrew .
Watch Cassius .
Not until we part as friends .
What do you mean by "furniture" ?
This terrible storm has smashed the Turks so badly that their plans are ruined .
I'm very uncomfortable , and that won't help my case .
Swords don't frighten me .
She speaks my language !
Oh , beautiful and accomplished lady , may the heavens rain odors upon you !
Is he in his royal garments ?
How did you sleep , my lord ?
Honestly , you're speaking the truth , ever since the fools were With his mouth full of news .
You are lesser than Macbeth but also greater .
Good grief , do you think that just because I'm dressed like a man , I have a man's patience ?
So you've dared him to single combat .
I swear I'm not lying .
No , I don't , except as a friend .
Oh , my poor brother !
I say my prayers out loud .
He was like that time of year halfway between the extremes of hot and cold : he was neither sad nor happy .
One weakness led to another , to make me hate myself .
Master , if you eat with her , bring really long silverware .
When she cries , all the little flowers cry too .
Brutus will lead , and we'll follow him with the boldest and best hearts of Rome .
Men who risk everything hope to make profits .
I don't believe it .
You're famous for it .
As good a reason as any .
They've turned me into food for worms .
Pretty York , who told you about his teeth ?
Lucius !
I suspect some foul play .
It seems that the guards who were supposed to be protecting his chamber did it .
You and he are both welcome , sir .
I have already condemned and excused myself .
I can't say no .
But he isn't here now .
When you just want to eat , it's better to do that at home .
You're acting like an ass , don't you think ?
Where ?
He accuses me of withholding his share of Sextus Pompeius' possessions , which we seized in Sicily .
If you get nasty with me , Pistol , I'll stab you with my sword , in fair play .
Why are you talking like that ?
I've almost forgotten what fear feels like .
Oh , honey !
Why are they running away ?
I have drawn my sword .
He'll be done in time .
Of course he is , and so are you .
God , that song's even better than the other one .
Do I mistreat even my enemies ?
But when exactly will we see Benedick married ?
But men tend to interpret things however suits them and totally miss the actual meaning of the things themselves .
No , not a bit .
To see an elderly , unlucky merchant from Syracuse publicly beheaded for breaking the law and coming here to Ephesus .
You're a senator !
Are you going to take care of this thing now ?
When only one or two men have all the good manners , and even they are dirty , things are bad .
It's a very pleasing night to honest men .
Just as if they were perfectly loyal and faithful .
Now let me see if I can translate it .
The death of my father , my physical weakness , the loss of all my friends , the threats of this man who's taken me prisoner , all that would be easy for me to take , if only I could look through my prison windows once a day and see this girl .
Excuse me , sir ?
Yes , noble lord .
My hands are tainted if they hit an inferior , especially since I myself am the cause of my own distress .
No I don't , believe me .
I wish night would come , like a widow dressed in black , so I can learn how to submit to my husband and lose my virginity .
But as far as I can tell , people with too much suffer as much as people with nothing .
I remember this fellow , he once played the eldest son of a farmer .
I put my trust in you .
You can heat your iron up in here .
If it's really you , tell me what happened to our son , who floated away with you on that deadly raft .
My life has run its circle .
Ha !
Pray well , father .
What hope is that , may I ask ?
I do indeed , my lord .
Please , let me review the contract .
The king performs more wonders than seem humanly possible , challenging every enemy he sees .
You bring your cauldrons , your spells , your charms , and everything else .
My falcon is now hungry and unfed and must not be given enough to eat until she comes to me , for if her hunger is satisfied , she'll pay no attention to the bait .
We'll get married at some point , Audrey .
He's recruited Bocchus , the King of Libya ; Archelaus of Cappadocia ; Philadelphos , King of Paphlagonia ; the Thracian king , Adallas ; King Manchus of Arabia ; the King of Pont ; Herod , of Judea ; Mithridates , King of Comagen ; Polemon and Amyntas , the kings of Mede and Lycaonia , and many more .
When it's paid , bring your friend back .
Take out your sword .
What marvelous music !
Hello , good sir .
I was sure that you hadn't given it to me .
Then I could stop wondering , and find some other career .
Oh , good old man , you're a great example of that old work ethic , where people worked because it was their duty , not just for the money .
Perform the speech just as I taught you , musically and smoothly .
I don't want to dance .
Lay her in the ground , and let violets bloom from her lovely and pure flesh !
For the sake of your father's memory , make peace .
How else is he the "man in the moon" ?
Good morning to both of you .
Oh , dear gods !
The pig or the mighty or the huge or the magnanimous , they all mean the same thing , with some variation .
So , by heaven's decree , Rosalind Was composed Of different faces , eyes , and hearts , so that she might have the most prized touches of all .
Well , I'm nearly finished .
Oh , it breaks my heart to think how painful it must be for you to recall all this , things that I can't remember .
But you're not going to deliver it , are you ?
Yes , I found him when he was asleep , so that's taken care of too , and the Athenian woman was sleeping near him .
It's gone .
I'm sure I can guess .
She's talking , but she's not saying anything .
How do you do , sir .
There's something downright unnatural about it , if a philosopher stopped to think about it .
What do you mean , get rid of him ?
Oh wicked wall , through which I don't see any happiness !
She has the stones on her , and the ducats." I know , all the boys in Venice are following him , yelling , "His stones , his daughter , and his ducats ! "
Prince Dauphin , you'll stay with me in Rouen .
Play the music. , Take my hands , my queen , and we'll lull these people to sleep with our soft dancing .
I was talking to some Venetians down by the shore , and the fool showed up .
Monster sweetie , be a good monster and just speak once .
Join your witchcraft with your beauty , and let Antony's lust combine with both .
I can do anything !
I rescued that ungrateful boy next to you from drowning .
Read it .
At this very minute an old black ram is having sex with your little white lamb .
It's Orlando , who triumphed over both the wrestler and you in the same instant .
Thisbe is the lady Pyramus is in love with .
I did , Malvolio ?
Then patiently listen to my impatience .
What "passion" ?
Right this instant , I'm going to Caesar's funeral .
If his cause is wrong , our obedience to the king clears us of responsibility for it .
Yes , my good lord .
We just want you to answer to your real name .
I thought the king preferred the Duke of Albany to the Duke of Cornwall .
All the rest of you can leave too .
But still , my uncle-father and aunt-mother have got the wrong idea .
What's up , Grumio ?
If she'd been faithful to me , I never would have given her up , not even if God himself offered me a jewel as big as a planet in exchange for her .
You have more wild goose in one of your jokes than I have in five of mine .
What , I have to hold a candle up so people can see what I'm doing ?
What , in my presence ?
Tie him up , I tell you .
They see , smell , and taste sweet and sour just like their husbands .
Oh , how awful that a lady who's been rejected by one man should therefore be treated horribly by another one !
The things she has shamelessly hurled on me are beyond imagination .
Noble Antony , even illness couldn't keep me away .
I think the marriage was made more for political reasons than for love .
No , don't be ashamed , Cleopatra .
I'm in a mood to beat you up pretty good .
Who takes care of them ?
Have you ever cured anyone this way before ?
I think he's nervous , he's about to become the savage bull who got domesticated .
Stand further away .
Yes , but they don't see anything .
Othello isn't any of those things .
Goodbye , Helena .
Well there , now you've said it .
But wait a minute .
Tell me , do I have your consent to kill them ?
The same thing .
My noble kinsman , welcome .
In this day and age , if a man doesn't erect his own monument before he dies , he won't be remembered past the funeral bell's ringing and his widow's crying .
Lucentio's son is older than that , sir .
I wouldn't marry her , even if she were as blessed as paradise .
What does that have to do with my Lysander ?
Are you done yet ?
We are responsible for this .
Please don't tell me any more .
He was in a good mood , and then suddenly he started thinking of Rome .
First , he sends his regards .
Will you come with me ?
I wish I had not lived long enough to see him die .
I'm speechless .
Ran off with a Christian !
Then why be jealous of a person like that ?
Where's Peaseblossom ?
You might have a great opportunity to give it to him right now .
Oh love !
I'm not well .
Poor Tom's chilly .
I'd rather be anything besides a fool .
If he fears God , he must necessarily keep the peace .
Venice has made Cassio governor here on Cyprus .
So then why should I offer this womanish defense that I'm innocent ?
Wrong , evil traitor .
I think I see a friend who will pay my bail and save my life .
Is it really possible that you could like her right after meeting her ?
Good morning , General .
No , madam .
Young though I am , I've been observing these three blowhards closely .
Come , uncle Exeter , enter Harfleur .
There's no masquerade tonight .
It'd be impossible for you to watch them , even if they were as horny as animals in heat and as stupid as drunks .
No , it's permanent .
He smiles so much his face has more lines in it than a map of the East Indies .
Caesar , I will .
Be bold , and get ready .
Your magic spell has such an effect on them that if you saw them now , you'd feel sorry for them .
If we're Hello , Monsieur Le Beau .
It's not friendly , and it's not ladylike .
It's a wild night .
If I'd been a god I would've let the sea sink inside the earth before it had a chance to swallow up that ship and all the people it was carrying .
If not , what can you do about it ?
There is a crab-apple here .
Guys who'd take her with all her faults , provided there were enough money involved .
You know that I used to believe in Epicurus and his disregard for omens .
Caesar , I never believed in omens , but now they frighten me .
But he would feel even better if I could tell him that you had left Antony and put yourself under his protection .
Come on , what would you say about me ?
I know I may be old , but I'm strong and healthy , because in my youth I never drank nor lived recklessly .
I'd rather be a heretic than a schemer with fancy plots .
It's true .
I'd rather bear with you than Well , this is the Forest of Arden .
The hell with order !
I'll fight brutally .
Many men have sold their souls Just to view my shiny surface .
Why , the man who shortens his life by twenty years cuts off twenty years of worrying about death .
Oh , come on now , Kate .
will damage your reputation with them , and under ordinary circumstances it would be unfortunate to have them see you as an ogre .
Thank you very much .
You're both wrong .
We have And one of them is the criminal Deformed .
It's obvious : Here comes Biondello .
Can you tell me whether Rosalind , Duke Senior's daughter , has also been banished ?
I know a terrific wench .
Now I'll get Cassio to do something in front of all these drunkards that will offend everyone on the island .
Then there's still a chance .
And what is this useless ceremony of kings ?
Don't stick your head out into the public street to stare at the Christian fools with painted faces .
Give me access to them , and soon you won't have to worry about them anymore .
But oh , what a deceiver he turned out to be !
Tell your wife to watch her .
Such exercise !
None of us .
He thanks you on his knees many times and considers himself fortunate to have fallen into the hands of one , as he thinks , who is the bravest , most valorous , and thrice-worthy gentleman of England .
Don't be cruel , Demetrius .
I found them on a tree .
The wooing is like a Scottish jig : hot and fast and full of whimsy and illusion .
And here I am , going crazy in the middle of the woods because I can't find my Hermia .
You're a villain to say this about me .
Come here .
Renowned duke , please join us in the abbey , where we will discuss at length all that has happened to us .
Thursday it is , then .
Look who's coming .
Take care of the queen !
Hey !
He is made of treachery , and has run away to avoid his crimes .
Is that possible ?
I am one , my lord .
If he's so sad and solemn when he's young , I can only imagine how much he'll cry as an old man .
I spoke with some of the sailors who survived the wreck .
Yes , my lord .
While the moon was shining we didn't even notice the candle .
It's too bad I'm so hard-hearted , because I really don't love anyone .
But mortals like you aren't allowed to hear this description of the afterlife .
There must be some resolution .
Hello , do you have any news ?
Calm down , sir , please .
Gentle gods in heaven , please let me die .
I will .
Then I have to assume you don't want him to be king .
Come , death , and welcome !
I hope things go well there .
I'll tell him all of this , dear lady .
I loved Ophelia .
But there are many herbs that will help him rest and take his mind off his anguish for a while .
Did Cicero say anything ?
Do you love me ?
No more about that , please .
He answered , "You penniless bastard !
And last night at dinner , you got up abruptly and paced back and forth with your arms crossed , brooding and sighing , and when I asked you what was the matter , you gave me a dirty look .
He laughed at that and let me go .
It's mine and I'm going to get it .
Musicians , come in !
You will be whipped .
Oh , a plague has been prevented , thank God !
Oh , you should have done it without telling me !
My God , they've given me a lot to drink .
Do you want me to lie , madam ?
Here's a sick man who wants to speak with you .
What kind of fighting cock is this ?
Look , here comes the woman you love .
Yes , and it seemed twice as long to me , having been kept from your bed that whole time .
What do you have to say , noble friend ?
Good news , friends .
You're an insolent little boy .
Do something about it , then .
As soon as the deed is done , you will be in my favor and I will promote you .
Still , did you notice how ready he was to hire good tutors for her ?
He should imprison the person who named you , instead .
Listen to the noble Antony .
I think that's strange .
I could marry that Maria for thinking this up .
In the end I grudgingly consented .
The things that threaten me have only seen my back .
When grown-ups teach little children , they do it gently and easily .
What do you say ?
I don't want to have anything to do with you anymore .
How about the mustard without the beef .
Yes .
No , it hasn't , my lord .
Yes , let the count take you in your bed .
I pay you because you're poor , not because you want me to buy this .
You've killed an innocent woman , and you're going to pay dearly for her death .
Please be quiet .
I've said what I have to say .
To be good-looking is a matter of luck , but to read and write is a natural gift .
You know that he does .
Silly babbler , how you talk !
His messengers are waiting here to take me to him immediately , on pressing state business .
If I saw twenty of the greatest powers that pay tribute to Caesar taking such liberties with her hand , what's her name now ?
His eyes started glazing over around eight in the morning .
Don't worry about that .
I must join the duke for lunch .
Hermia is lucky , wherever she is , because she has beautiful eyes .
Are you planning on showing me all your wit at once ?
I've heard about this indirectly , but I will send for him .
Neither can my accomplishments at sea .
And who are you , good sir ?
We'll revenge his death .
And so will I .
Then see a good one for me .
Hang our flags on the outer walls .
I'll break my spells and bring them back to their senses , and they'll feel like themselves again .
He doesn't have any daughters , sir .
No , my lord .
Honestly , it's not as good as the other one , and I'm sure your cousin will agree with me .
Good and noble young man , don't mess with someone who's desperate .
Norfolk , we're going to have a few blows , right ?
Oh my , Oh my !
If you aren't weeping , it's a good sign that I'll soon have a new father .
Speak .
Be kind to her .
Whatever pertains to myself I will deal with last .
You should always be honest .
I'll give him my gray horse Capilet if he forgets the whole thing .
He has called for his horse , but I don't know where he's headed .
I humbly say goodbye .
You sent for me , sir ?
Come here , ma'am .
Well , by this I can see that you don't love me as much as I love you .
Please , leave me alone .
We'll bury him , and then we'll commit acts as brave and fine as any Romans , and make death proud to take us .
Which one will start yammering first , Gonzalo or Adrian ?
How are you , my friend ?
Daughters who can make you obey them .
But don't take all that pain on yourself .
Well then , your uncle and the Prince and Claudio have been deceived .
Then , in my tent , you can elaborate on your complaints , and I'll listen .
My wife and I ordered him to hang Cordelia in prison and then to make it look as if she committed suicide in despair .
Maybe it'll come again .
Orlando , do you really believe that this boy can do everything he's promised ?
What ?
The fool will stay .
Because , you know , Pyramus and Thisbe meet by moonlight .
Stand away from the hearse .
Menas , I don't understand how minor quarrels can be superseded by greater ones .
He asks her to do what God Say she will be a high and mighty queen .
Come at me in the form of a rugged Russian bear , an armor-plated rhinoceros , or a tiger from Iran .
There's no ambiguity here .
I can tell that something wicked is coming by the tingling in my thumbs .
You're a lying , cowardly wretch .
Please leave it to me to take care of the burial , as I have more reason to mourn than you do .
And when I've sneaked up on my sons-in-law , then I'll kill , kill , kill , kill , kill , kill !
But I spoke with someone who saw Cawdor die , and he said that Cawdor openly confessed his treasons , begged your highness's forgiveness , and repented deeply .
Say I will love her everlastingly .
Unless your taunts can undo the signature on my contract , you're just wearing out your lungs by speaking so loud .
Tell her that the king , who has the power to command people , asks her .
When did you become so fond of singing , boy ?
Prison , my lord ?
This is the place .
Are you always going to be like this ?
Tomorrow , and then every day after that .
I'd like to sing my song solo .
What ?
And isn't a sheep's grease as wholesome as a man's sweat ?
I must leave them and seek some better employment .
I'll give it to him .
The humiliation is all mine .
Thank you for saying that .
I want to hear more about this .
And now you're asking for money .
I beg your
Would you walk out with me , sir ? , Oh , Desdemona , Yes , my lord ?
You are not , Cassius .
If we look like musicians to you , you can expect to hear nothing but noise .
Don't think I blame you .
May the gods be with you .
Well , it doesn't matter anymore .
Well , get out of here then !
The ambassadors are back from Norway , sir .
Take him safely through the lines .
What was it that you told me today , that your niece Beatrice was in love with Signior Benedick ?
True .
Pompey , you can not frighten us with your navy .
Listen !
Why do you come here ?
Deal ?
I'll change that name for you .
Tear him apart , tear him up !
Oh no !
Take a good look , and you'll see that one of the three men who rule the world has turned into a whore's jester .
This is the end of my journey , the end of my life .
With that , I'll be off .
They say he used to fence for the shah of Persia .
Her bridegroom is here .
I'm tired of you .
He still hasn't told us about the captain .
We say the king is wise and good , and his noble queen is getting old , pretty , and not jealous .
Because it's dark out , I'm afraid all this is just a dream , too sweet to be real .
I'm going to get my Please , listen to me .
God knows why , but your mother and your brother have taken sanctuary in Westminster Abbey .
No , I'm begging you now , tell me who it is .
You have a fat friend at your master's house : she took care of me in the kitchen today , thinking I was you .
Around three or four o'clock , look for news from the meeting hall .
Lurk out of sight .
And you can't put your heads together and figure out why he's acting so dazed and confused , ruining his peace and quiet with such dangerous displays of lunacy ?
Greet the king with a welcoming expression in your eyes , your hands , and your words .
What kind of game is this ?
We might as well call him a man , since God created him .
Absolutely .
I do suffer love , because I love you against my will .
Admit you were wrong .
He gave Syria , Cilicia , and Phoenicia to Ptolemy .
Your words and actions don't match up .
Isn't it past two o'clock ?
What is the name of the castle that stands over there ?
Which he'll shove down our throats the way pigeons feed their young .
That's him , that villain Romeo .
I'll wait on them with all respect and duty .
Don't forget the vows we made to each other .
Ask for me tomorrow , and you'll find me in a grave .
Don't you have any respect for anything ?
Meet me at the palace as soon as possible .
What could I hope to get from you , who've got nothing but your charm to support you in life ?
Madam ?
Who's there ?
True .
When was the last time you saw my father ?
Shut up , you doddering old wizard !
I don't think there's a man under the sun who's worse at hiding his love or hate than Richard .
My lord acts just as crazy with love as you do .
He's great-looking , but how can you talk to someone who doesn't speak your language ?
Come on , sir , let's go .
Go where , my lord ? , Cesario , my husband , stay here .
The wide ocean doesn't prevent them from coming to see her , they travel across it as if it were a little stream .
But you've seen her and Cassio together .
Well , anyway , goodbye .
Hello .
And whatever we do , we can lay all the blame on the drunken servants .
I wish you could !
Look , the precious Desdemona has arrived on shore .
O Harry's wife , do not triumph in my sorrow !
We did a lot of drinking in Egypt .
What's that noise ?
And will you have me ?
But let's stop this drinking and get down to business. , God forgive our sins ! , Gentlemen , let's get down to business .
Where have you been , my bravery ?
I'd rather be a squawking bird than an animal like you .
Dear Sir Toby , don't do anything rash tonight .
I will .
and affection , even if it's just an act .
The day is well on its way .
For my part , I really don't care .
And don't be suspicious of me , noble Brutus .
If your Majesty would like , I'll muster up my friends and meet you wherever and whenever you like .
Sextus Pompeius is sailing toward the port of Rome .
He sent a messenger ahead of him who arrived here so out of breath that he could barely speak his message .
If anyone here knows a better way to tame a shrew , speak up , please .
I think it's better to call it off .
What is this ?
Look what I have here .
Even if marrying her meant I died .
That's why your daughter and son-in-law are punishing me shamefully .
I'm yours forever .
This is the brave sergeant who fought to keep me from being captured .
Groan ?
Even if I had a whole bunch of mouths , I wouldn't be able to answer that .
There's a similar mark on her arm .
But listen to me , Gratiano .
But it wasn't until this afternoon that he broke out into violence .
But gods , you give us faults so we'll be human .
Yes , he has .
I hope some will fall off tomorrow .
A good plan , warrior king .
I would gladly do without that if he would only stay faithful to me .
I've never been more useful to you than I will be now .
In that case , I think Cassio's an honest man .
I am an ass , indeed : you can tell by my long ears .
That makes you an even bigger villain. , Well , throw him out , and have my officers seize his house and lands .
You're right .
I haven't done anything to you .
The Earth is nature's mother and also nature's tomb .
Now go , and hurry back .
Antony would easily outshine all imaginary beings .
Kent , if you want to stay alive , stop talking .
Actually , it's my arm .
I became his guide , I led him and begged for him , and kept him from suicide .
Are you a god ?
Yes , right now .
It's a green-eyed monster that makes fun of the victims it devours .
Now you say it was "Knock at the gate" ?
Dighton and Forrest , whom I hired to perform the butchery , are used to killing people , the bloody dogs .
It's time we hit the road .
Be at ease .
Here , stand behind this wall ; he'll come right away .
Are you with a Cornish company ?
Meanwhile , thank you for your efforts .
What is making our eyes and ears act so strangely ?
No .
Self-love , my liege , is not so great a sin as self-neglect .
Murder , murder !
I don't have it with me .
I won't have anything to do with it .
Do you think I would live a life of jealousy , tormented by new suspicions every hour ?
Gone ?
Get over it .
I could marry you there , gentle Hermia , where the strict laws of Athens can't touch us .
You feel love because you feel lust and you have no willpower .
I'll leave now , to set all these things right .
What can you do but be happy ?
Be loud and obnoxious .
Oh , go away , you're a boring fool .
If you care about your health , you won't push me any further .
Yes , absolutely , no question or ambiguity about it .
That's burglary , that is .
I don't care .
Go to my room and put on something of mine .
I won't follow him around with useless pleas anymore .
What was it ?
I'm sure he's somewhere on the island .
They can sit out there until they die of hunger and disease .
Yes , his chest !
Call my guard , please .
They won't pinch me , frighten me , push me in the mud , or mislead me unless he tells them to .
She had a premonition of what has actually happened .
Nothing .
Look , sir .
Jacob didn't have any control over what happened .
Oh , if you only knew how close to success you are , even while you make fun of what I'm telling you !
Okay , I'm ready .
Poor man !
What have I ever done that he has anything to complain about ?
him terribly .
The flags have fallen .
Your husband .
You'll just have to be patient for a little while .
The only thing you can sense are punches , just like an ass .
I would be glad to forget about it , but it weighs on my memory like sins linger in guilty minds .
I'm sure he will stay under control .
Bad luck , bad luck ?
God bless you !
Sir , that would be me and my partner .
Good .
I'll make him tell me the whole story again , where , how often , how long ago , and when he plans to sleep with your wife in the future .
My noble uncle , do you know why he acts this way ?
How dare What , is the man crazy ?
Here , you goddamn incest-breeding Danish murderer , drink this .
Can't you see for yourself ?
She's been drowned in salty sea water , and now my salty tears are about to drown her memory all over again .
If you and I don't value her equally , it would be better for us to work out our differences without her .
I think I can guess what you're about to say .
Good night , ladies , good night , sweet ladies , good night , good night .
Why should that name be proclaimed more than yours ?
All right , we'll see you at dinnertime .
I'm going to make sure I stay on your good side , lady .
You do the same , wherever the crowds are thick .
Killing pigs .
I'm afraid something dangerous is coming toward you .
I heard myself declared an outlaw and escaped capture by hiding in the trunk of a hollow tree .
Will you listen to me , Roderigo ?
Goodbye , Launcelot .
I'm still a virgin .
My master is being difficult .
I wish you could just stammer this hidden man out of your mouth like wine out of a narrow-necked bottle : either too much at once or none at all .
If you would have such a man , take me .
No , just listen to me .
We thought he was a coward , but he fights like a devil .
Now sit down , everybody , and rehearse your parts , Pyramus , you start .
How What , are you jealous , Oberon ? , Fairies , let's get out of here .
That's really the best way to win the Moor back again .
I'd trust him with everything I own .
I'm arresting you as a criminal .
What did my man say ?
Your answers are too shallow and too hasty .
He's very handsome and speaks well , but he's very young .
Stars , my lord .
But what danger we'll put ourselves in , two young , innocent women traveling so far !
Well , praise the Lord you're ugly .
How low we can fall , Horatio .
I'm starting to lose my mind .
Good night , good brother .
No , I'll recite it for you right now : "de hand , de fangres , de nails , " "De nails , " madame .
Watch out , boy , remember I can whip you .
Yes , my good lord .
Men tend to be at their most irresponsible when they're away from home .
Isn't their ingratitude like the mouth biting the hand that feeds it ?
Only too well .
I will never be exhibited as lucky Caesar's prize .
I'll be gentle and mild .
Those who have done this deed are honorable .
Therefore , all lovers should speak for themselves .
Well , okay. , I swear to God , both their stories match .
Well , I wish you liked me .
Why , what is there to do before I get there ?
Good father , I'm begging you on my knees , be patient and listen to me say just one thing .
What do you want with me ?
No more than a minute ?
Goodbye .
You know I gave it to you just now .
She'll find out soon enough by one of our messengers how respectfully and kindly we plan to treat her .
Some should go to the public platforms and cry out , "Liberty , freedom , and democracy ! " People and senators , don't be afraid .
My lord is so heavy !
Oh , how strange !
You know , uncle , A sparrow once raised a cuckoo in its nest Until the cuckoo grew up and bit the sparrow's head off .
You bastard !
It's true , this so-called "god" , he shook .
You're most welcome .
First kiss me , Kate , and then we will .
The devil himself couldn't say a name I hate more .
And what will you do if it returns to you ?
My master's calling me .
Well , no , not literally .
Pick up her bed and carry her ladies out of the tomb .
By that kind of logic , I should hate Orlando , since my father hates his father .
Heaven knows you're as unfaithful as hell .
But his investments are uncertain right now .
This one talks about how Roderigo should kill Cassio .
Do you have anything else to say ?
You agree now that we're not imagining this , don't you ?
So goodbye until we meet again .
We have to go out and talk to them .
Please , give it to me .
What did he tell you , Ophelia ?
This is the door .
Let's do that , Lysander .
Otherwise , I'll die a virgin , devoted to you .
May God reward you for your kindness !
Is this the Prince's brother ?
You will love more than you are loved .
You can argue as much as you like when there's nothing else to do .
Oh Friar , damned souls use the word banishment to describe hell .
Really , cousin , it's him .
Then I'll know exactly what she is , just as I know what I am .
Wait a minute .
You seasoned his food with screams .
I'm your master , Dromio .
Would you tie me to a whole world of worries ?
Stay here .
I'd never do such a bad thing , not for the whole world !
I will , my lady , but a sane person reading this would make it sound crazy .
We can be happy that things have been resolved so agreeably .
I'm never in the mood to laugh when I hear sweet music .
May the good Lord keep me safe from all women like her !
Is that the man you want ?
It's partly my own fault , since I followed you here .
These things are beyond anything we've seen before , and I'm afraid .
May a plague curse both your families .
If I don't do all this , never trust me again .
That braggart , punk villain who fights like he learned swordsmanship from a manual !
Lady Beatrice , have you been crying this entire time ?
Come on , noble captain .
It's someone with a torch !
I hope you get what you desire !
My honorable , reverend master ?
Go , get out !
Sister , calm down .
I don't expect him to answer for me , and yet I'm determined to fight vigorously for him .
He can't speak , my lord .
I would have sworn that , too , my lord , especially against Benedick .
Don't stay to answer me , get going .
And when I'm king , remember to ask me for the earldom of Hereford and all the possessions that go with it , which my brother the king used to own .
Their villainy nauseates me , and I must therefore vomit it up .
Yes , and the best looking too .
You did , not just once or twice , but twenty times .
I heard him swear he did .
But tell me , which of my good qualities first made you suffer love for me ?
The police are here .
You've done well at sea .
Come on .
Come on , I'll fight you .
And he's rubbed himself with perfume .
Bloody , inhuman villain !
Not now .
Wait for mine , sweet soul .
Or stole it , rather .
And he deserves it , having been excellent before he had a reputation for it .
I'm telling you this story for a reason .
I pray that God ends his life before I die , so I can say , "The dog is dead ! "
Signor Bassanio !
Because of me ?
Listen , listen to what I say : whoever strikes first , I'll run him through with my sword , as sure as I'm a soldier .
Kneel , Romans , kneel , and let's wash our hands , up to the elbows , in Caesar's blood and smear it on our swords .
I honor him for being brave .
How many noblemen were killed in the battle you just fought ?
I'm not myself .
Wherever he goes , he inspires compassion and people turn against us .
Here comes my wife now .
What evil and deceitful mirror made me think I could rival Hermia's starry eyes ?
Don't cry , don't cry .
Have him come to me here , soldier .
Be careful not to fall in .
That means it's high time for me to go .
Look how the judge yells at a simple thief .
Give me your hand , Messala .
A sleeve ?
Good gentlemen , give me permission to speak .
I won't tolerate him .
Keep up your courage , man !
I've been crazed with so many miseries that my tongue has tired of lamenting and gone mute .
He's gone , and his wife's dead .
Give me your arm .
You men are rank beginners !
I'm only trying to keep the peace .
You are what's left of the noblest man that ever lived .
But I will tell you that lately the duke has been displeased with his niece , and for no other reason than that people praise her virtues and pity her for her father's sake .
Now they work for me .
This is how God forces wicked men to turn their swords against themselves .
Tell me what it's about .
If you weren't a man , then what kind of animal were you when you first told me you wanted to do this ?
Decius Brutus doesn't love you .
I saw Othello's true face when I saw his mind .
Heaven commanded Nature To fill her one body With all the graces that women contain .
I'm ordering you , go home .
I want very much to find out .
I will , my Hermia .
One of you go find the forest ranger .
Are you sick ?
They'll be married tomorrow , and I'll invite the duke to the ceremony .
But if you steal my reputation , you're robbing me of something that doesn't make you richer , but makes me much poorer .
Follow" ?
I dreamed about an emperor called Antony .
I told him we'll stay for at least a month , and he says that he hopes we'll stay longer .
No , no .
Beat the drum .
In heaven .
Swear by my sword .
What do you say ?
Stay and tell me more .
Then heaven have mercy on me .
It was windy on shore too .
I'll go get my sister and see what she thinks .
I saved his life and gave him my love , without reservation .
I can't , my lord .
We used to sit together and sew one flower with our two needles , sewing it on one piece of cloth , sitting on the same cushion , singing one song in the same key , as if our hands , our sides , our voices and our minds were stuck together .
Good-bye .
It's true , I confess .
You're thinking something .
Not me .
And her sister's dead too , poisoned by your wife .
is yours." And , though I say so in his presence , if he's not a friend of the best kings , you'll find him king of the best friends .
Let heaven and men and devils tell me to shut me up .
If you won't leave , then
Go find those herbs for him , before his madness puts his life in danger .
Do tell .
Yes , sir , I have .
I was .
You look pale and wild as if you're going to hurt yourself .
And so , good morning to all of you .
Then I will swear to Kate and you to me , and may our oaths be faithfully kept and prove fortunate .
These are unnatural events .
Good fool , good jester , I'll make it worth your while if you get me a candle , and a pen , ink and paper .
What's the matter here , gentlemen ? , Honest Iago , you look upset .
Your love says , like an honorable gentleman , 'Where is your mother ?
Yes , and I'll do everything I just said .
You stole it from her ?
Antony's eyes are fiery red from crying .
I know he's noble , rich , young , and with a fine reputation .
It's true that your son Lucentio here loves my daughter , and she loves him , or else they're putting on quite an act .
My lord , he asks that you please visit him tomorrow or the next day .
What's happening to me , that I'm frightened of every noise ?
Let us in so we can tie him up tight and bring him home to recover .
I want more uncles here to welcome me .
What disease is he talking about ?
Goodbye .
Alas , grim death , how vile and ugly your near-twin , sleep , is !
How are you , Hamlet ?
Good morning , sweet Hero .
He'd better not speak badly of Brutus here .
If that's true , he won't get it back by crying .
I admit that in front of you , my lady , she keeps a bit quiet .
You won't see anything like that , sweetheart .
But , oh , heavenly Rosalind !
The young generation rises while the old one falls .
But I'll stop rebuking you .
Did you just call me "beautiful" ?
Portia !
She will not .
I'd say the same thing , but I'm afraid I'd be faced out of my way .
Here's my servant .
And pay attention to what Caesar does and which men are close to him .
Here's to you , Menas .
Whatever I think , I have to say .
Be quiet .
Do you know any , Hero ?
We're lucky that Rome is rid of him .
His kiss is as holy as bread blessed by a priest .
Oh , noble Caesar !
Jesus , let's kill him !
But I'll go out of spite , to feed off the wasteful Christian. , Jessica , my girl , watch the house .
Yes , my lord .
Please do .
No , it is not possible you should love the enemy of France , Kate .
Everything I am and everything I have now belongs to you .
Great Queen Juno is coming .
The bearer of bad news is often blamed for it .
All right , my lord. , How's the king doing ?
Ha !
Drowning is for cats or blind puppies , don't drown yourself !
Here's the hut , my lord .
Go ahead , do your worst .
Oh , good Demetrius , will you find him for me ?
My liege , this was my glove .
I will , my lord .
You'd break a date with your beloved by a whole hour ?
Which one of them should I pick ?
Heaven help me , I don't know you , sir .
Then there must be no lovers in the forest , either , because they're as good as a clock , marking the lazy foot of time with a sigh every minute and a groan every hour .
So is Lysander .
To get what you want , you need to get Cassio out of the way .
Can God be so jealous and hateful ?
You're hitting close to home there .
Fair princess , you've missed some good sport .
Everyone prepare to take this beautiful corpse to her grave .
It's not daylight .
We must remember the gravity of this sad day .
I will not rise until your Highness hears me .
Show us the way , sir .
Brutus speaks .
What a lying , drunken monster .
What's your profession ?
I'll catch it before it falls to the ground .
Oh , she tears that letter into a thousand small pieces and berates herself for being so forward as to write a letter to a man she knows would mock her .
How beautiful the moonlight's shining on this bank !
No , sir .
Oh , that's ominous !
Send the necklace to her , or send me with a token that will authorize her to pay me .
I want you to see the difference between us , so I pardon you even before you ask for a pardon .
Who's shouting ?
I'll have you two hide , and the fool too , right where he'll find the letter .
I'll go to lunch .
You will be an accessory to both crimes .
Who was with them last ?
I've got something for you .
I confess my crime and throw myself on your Highness's mercy .
You don't know that ?
No , let's not swear an oath .
Sweetheart !
Exactly right .
Did you say Caesar fainted ?
Heaven knows what he's going to do with it .
I'm here , I've been destroyed by villains !
It's two o'clock now .
A servant told me the night-watchmen saw horrid sights too , but different ones from what we heard and saw .
I wish we were safely on board our ship already .
In the meantime I wrote to Romeo and told him to come here on this awful night to help remove her from her temporary grave when the sleeping potion wore off .
Does he reward my dedicated service with such deep contempt ?
If you had , the kings that have revolted and the soldier that deserted this morning would still be behind you .
The hand of death has taken him .
My stomach's a little upset .
My uncle the king is to blame for this .
Someone deliver the order that Buckingham be brought to Salisbury .
What's her name ?
Yes , Captain , but with this acknowledgement , that God fought for us .
I swear to God you're accusing me wrongly !
If she punishes you , master , she's sure to punish me .
Only to watch that title become worthless , as her mother has .
A devil like you could lead me to hell .
I'll write him a taunting letter , and you can deliver it .
The French have reinforced their scattered men .
You must be crazy to say that !
But you heard him swear up and down that he was .
The sky's so dark it looks like it would rain down boiling hot tar if the sea weren't swelling up to the sky to put its fire out .
Show it !
Did you notice ?
So be calm .
Let go of me !
He's lost his comrades and is wandering around looking for them .
So young and so cruel ?
Oh , ho !
Just the weathervane moving .
Where's my cousin Toby ?
And you deadly cannons that roar like thunderbolts thrown by the gods , goodbye !
The duke will agree with me on that .
We've got it now. , Do you see this , my good fellow ?
Some people in the street are crying "Romeo." Some are crying "Juliet , " and some are crying "Paris." They're all running in an open riot toward our tomb .
I'll talk to you more about this some other time .
Tell me which part I'm going to play , then go on .
The only glory princes have are their titles .
But I have a legitimate son a few years older than this one , and I don't love him any more than I love my bastard .
Tonight I'm having a feast that we've celebrated for many years .
Is it possible ?
Neighbors and friends , though we don't have anyone for the bride and bridegroom's places at the table , you know there's nothing missing in the feast itself .
What was I saying ?
Why don't you go away for a bit ?
And I swear by my wickedness ( if I had any ) that I am a knave .
Time's not the one in debt .
Do you have the flower ?
Let's hear what he has to say .
Your Highness told me to ask for my commission today .
Wait , and listen to me , countrymen .
Pretending ?
I would rather be a country serving maid than a great queen if it meant I could escape your scorn and constant harassment .
Hello , Iago .
If that man , who's made up of conflicts , becomes musical , then there must be something wrong with the universe .
Or any of you ?
Reborn .
I'll go with you .
Tell him that the mayor , some citizens , and I have come to confer with his grace in matters of great importance concerning the general good .
No , my good knight .
But here she comes .
Oh , a thousand of them , all of which I've forgotten .
What a spoiled little brat .
The servants , the duke , and your daughter all seem to be treating you less kindly .
The law has another hold on you .
When he woke , he wouldn't know where he was .
And me too .
Drunk ?
Please give me that .
Listen to my excuse .
The Count sent me an excellent pair of perfumed gloves .
Yes , let her die and rot and go to hell tonight .
With him out of Venice , I can make whatever bargains I want when I lend money. , Go , Tubal .
It will be to your advantage , because I'll leave our father's house and all his property to you , while I live and die a shepherd here in the forest .
My ships will come home a month before the money is due .
Stay inside .
Yes , my lord .
His virtue is not hidden .
Where are Lysander and beautiful Hermia ?
shifts , friends , to Southampton .
There are parents living whose children you have butchered ; they are now old withered plants who will moan over their losses as they grow old .
Leave me , my friend .
Stay here .
You can't go back into the house unless you want to fight with me , and if you're willing to do that , you might as well just go and fight with him .
Wholeheartedly , good young man .
Why , this was modeled on a porridge bowl !
And you , go call my fool .
That's her father and his friends , who've been roused out of bed .
That's enough .
I had a dream last night about the three witches .
Well , onward , then .
Dear Macduff , I beg you , tell us you were lying and say it isn't so .
We both have eaten as well , and we can both endure the cold winter as well as he .
Is that chain you're wearing the one you promised to give to me ?
Oh , I'd never be that cruel .
My library was a large enough dukedom for me .
Until now , no one could say that only one man mattered in all of vast Rome .
I swear , I could do so much , Please , no more .
Here , sir !
For God's sake , let me hear it .
The man who tells a lie and swears by it is now considered as brave as Hercules .
Good madam , be patient .
His letter's going to be hilarious .
I thank you for that quip , good Tranio .
Rest assured that we're going there to use our hands , not our tongues .
Leave me alone .
It would be better for Macbeth to rule than someone like me .
He has to pay the price for his foolish actions .
Who's blocking the way ?
Has your lord given you any orders to negotiate with my face ?
I'll call you a minstrel .
That's what I'm doing .
Come on , Desdemona , I've only got an hour of love to spend with you , to tell you what you need to do .
Let me see what he looks like , so when I see another man who resembles him , I'll know to avoid him .
Stay !
But you have all the advantages from the harm done .
Doesn't a Jew have eyes ?
Tybalt , that murderer , which way did he run ?
You won't regret this .
I'm torn .
Why , what's the matter with him ?
Didn't he come home last night ?
Help , help , oh , help !
Do you doubt I'll write ?
Let your thoughts make up for our imperfections .
I'll meet you at the ferry .
There's still a bit of daylight in the sky .
I think the best sign of intelligence will soon be silence , and talking will only be a good thing for parrots to do .
The Duke's in a meeting right now , and he's sent for you too .
Keep your promise , my love .
Pour in the blood of a sow who has eaten her nine offspring .
Please , sir , hurry up .
Yes , that's true .
I wonder if you'd be so good , you lousy , rotten villain , to grant my wish and my request and gratify me , see , by eating this leek .
Not a bit , madam .
I have thousands of logs to take away and pile up , on strict orders from him .
I've had news that my Nell died of the pox in a hospice .
Have you heard something of her in your letters ?
No , not at all , All right , all right .
I wish the fool were dead and married to her grave !
Don't take my love for granted .
But is he often like this ?
Lucius , who's that knocking ?
He loves Caesar best , but he also loves Antony .
A man named Iago , the general's ensign .
Then one of you will warp and pull away , and there goes your marriage .
Who ?
Let me be your servant .
When they choose , they only know how to lose .
Write all this
Mr. Fabian , stay with this gentleman until I come back .
I'll disguise myself as you and pour out "my" feelings to Hero , taking her prisoner with the force of my love story .
It really is good to see you .
No .
We all must die , Messala .
An evil soul using a holy story is like a criminal who smiles at you .
Were you dreaming , Lucius ?
Have patience and endure .
Where are these murderers ?
Oh God , do I have to remember that ?
When Duke Frederick heard that great , worthy men were coming to this forest every day , he raised a large army to invade this land and fight his brother .
Tell me one .
Master Fer !
And when you do , Cassius , calm down .
You are Antonio , you are he .
What a stupid man he's become !
I'll drink it if I like .
I've seen you fight and envied your skill .
But I , who have never known how to beg and never had to beg , am starved for food , dizzy with lack of sleep , kept awake with curses and fed with brawling .
That's not a job for a friend , my lord .
You gave that handkerchief , the one I loved and gave to you , to Cassio .
Don't you , Dromio ?
Will you go hide ?
He thinks he's still playing his instrument .
I have no desire to go outside , yet something leads me there .
I've spent most of my money , and tonight I got beaten up .
We'll both be safer if we go separate ways .
Whoosh !
Wonderful !
Damn her !
More of us are here .
Sorrow interrupts all hours and seasons .
Murder's always horrible , but this one was especially horrible , weird , and unnatural .
Go and tell them this .
Farewell till then .
Pay a surgeon to stand by and bind his wounds , Shylock , so he doesn't bleed to death .
You're getting in the way of our work .
Oh , who did this thing ?
Thank you .
The jewels you took from me to deliver to Desdemona would've made even a nun want to sleep with me .
I wish it were day !
Good night .
Hate it , fear it , do not come inside .
Exactly .
What do you mean , the seventh cause ?
Whenever you want , since you're the one who wants it .
Sir , he left his belongings and treasure .
Damn you !
No , the man who can not extol the virtues of my horse from dawn to dusk is not particularly clever .
As far as I know , he's not even dead .
Your son will have my consent to marry my daughter .
Let it be .
I recognize his trumpet .
A man , like you .
Good point , and well said .
It's too hot .
What are you going to do now ?
Banquo !
What ?
Who has wronged him ?
Lucius , wake up !
It would be wrong for me to think poorly of my grandmother .
From then on we'll turn our backs on Athens .
He goes forth to war bravely .
That was good planning , and you'll sleep some more .
What could you possibly ask for ?
You're a lover .
I'd rather be a dog and howl at the moon than be that kind of Roman .
No .
Now I see it's true .
Oliver , your brother , no , not your brother ; and yet he's the son , but no , I won't call him the son , of that great man I was about to call his father , has heard about how well you did in the wrestling match , and tonight he's planning on burning your house down , with you in it .
I don't know what to believe , father .
But for one reason they refused to execute her .
So good night to everyone .
But you're not down and out , either , are you ?
Look , sir , this is a portrait of me as I am at this particular moment .
Let him go , Gertrude .
My heart is ten times lighter than my looks .
Why should you fall into so deep a moan ?
Why are you talking to me like this ?
Man , they were asking for it .
I will do more , though nothing I can do is any good since this remorse comes after the crime , asking for pardon .
Stinking like a swamp .
Sweet Hero ; when I imagine you now , you seem as beautiful as you did when I first loved you .
What's Pyramus ?
Pray you sit still .
That dirty rat !
One creditor showed me a ring he got from your daughter in exchange for a monkey .
How nice of you !
Good madam , restrain yourself .
Tell me that you'll accept my love .
It makes me mad .
If I find an opportunity , I will give him a piece of my mind .
May God in His mercy forgive you .
I'm telling you , you jerk priest , my sister will be an angel in heaven while you're howling in hell .
Eros , would you like to look through a window in Rome and watch your master marching in Caesar's victory parade , his arms crossed and tied , his head bowed in submission , his face red from shame , while the chariot of triumphant Caesar precedes him , putting the final stamp to his humiliation ?
But Audrey , there's a boy in the forest who claims you're his girl .
This is it , for now .
If she's cheated on me , then heaven itself is a fake .
If what you say is true , you can do the same to me .
Who I am and what I want are a secret .
I am the son of Marcus Cato !
Obey your parents , keep your word , don't swear , don't sleep with another man's wife , and don't covet flashy clothes .
Then let's go in and hear what he has to say , though I think I can guess before the Frenchman has uttered a word .
I can't believe it .
No Duke of spineless Burgundy can take this treasure of a girl from me now. , Say goodbye to them , Cordelia , even though they've been unkind to you .
My dear master , my captain , my sovereign , let me say before I strike this fatal blow : farewell .
I'll run away from you and hide in the bushes , and leave you to the mercy of wild animals .
Don't be disturbed by my illness .
Here lies Hero , The heroic maiden killed by slanderous words .
Gave me , sir ?
I'm even happier that I'm not stupid , and I can learn .
They said they were acting for you .
I wish the lightning had burned up all those logs that you've been ordered to stack !
Tell him to bring his pen and his inkwell to the jail .
Jesus , he's an ass if there ever was one !
A basting .
Eighty ducats !
I won't sleep until I see her , Hortensio .
I'll never see my gold again .
Oh , they continually urged the king to do it .
What did he say ?
giving it back to him .
Good luck .
For , as I am a soldier , the name I think suits me best , once I begin my attack on Harfleur again , I will not leave the half-conquered town until she lies buried in her own ashes .
Who is this ?
Just let me say one prayer !
But people often screw things up trying to make them better .
Noble Buckingham , your promise is like medicine to my ailing heart .
If I can tame him , I'll charge as much as I can get for him .
Now let my courage prove my title as wife .
Have some others search .
He was so sharp when he was in school .
This is a small house .
He has epilepsy , a disease where you fall down .
I have more news too .
I won't .
My generosity to you is as limitless as the sea , and my love is as deep .
Please be quiet .
I'll be more jealous of you than a wild rooster over his hen ; more noisy than a parrot chattering about the rain ; more fond of new things than an ape ; more giddy about getting what I want than a monkey .
I swear I will , Come on , let's go see what happens .
You lie .
That's him .
A gullible father and a brother who's so innocent that he can't suspect anyone else of wanting to hurt him , these are the two fools I need for my plan to work .
I don't think a team of oxen could get them close enough to fight .
Since nobody knows anything about what he leaves behind , then what does it mean to leave early ?
Was a man ever so tired ?
Set the honorable old man down and let him eat .
Oh !
Madam !
I'm a foolish , senile old man , eighty-something years old , not an hour more or less .
He has his moods and his ways .
Where are you running so fast ?
We can't think that way about what we did .
How are you , Lorenzo ?
I'm not a traitor .
Yes , yes , this is the rope ladder .
He has killed me , Mother .
Now that you are down there , you look like someone dead in the bottom of a tomb .
Go to the church : take the priest , the clerk , and some reasonably honest witnesses .
With his natural luck , he will beat you even against the odds .
A second Daniel ! , A Daniel , Jew !
Dromio , tell the servants to prepare for lunch .
I have done your bidding and fulfilled my promise .
As far as I know , sir .
Right .
Is Would your Mightiness care to wash his hands ?
If you don't want to , then good riddance .
You sound out of tune .
Won't the ladies be scared of the lion ?
I should really leave right away .
But now it's stopped .
And I for no woman .
He will have only justice and his penalty .
No , my lord , not me .
What are you talking about ?
You should have a guard nearby if he comes in here , because he's clearly disturbed .
Your sister's sister .
Enough , enough .
We'll go forward with you and meet them at Philippi .
I can't speak anymore .
Take up my mistress ' gown for his master's use !
God knows I have done my best to argue for you , and made him angry at me for being so aggressive .
Lecherous Cleopatra , may all the charms of love soften those withered lips !
I'm very sensitive , and even the smallest bit of rudeness hurts my feelings .
In a king , the sight is unbearable .
Swearing is for priests , cowards , overly cautious men , feeble old people , and those long-suffering weaklings who welcome abuse .
Oh , damn three times , damn ten times the evil man whose wicked deed deprived you of your ingenious mind .
The one the Moor gave to Desdemona , which you asked me to steal so many times .
Who's there ?
A fine ship , with some good people in it , I'm sure , smashed to pieces .
My mistress showed me you in the moon and your dog and your bush .
Is that possible ?
Mark Antony heard that you were preparing to wage war on him .
A kind good night to all !
And the doctors say it's healthy to get up early , I don't know what the doctors say .
It would make any man as mad as a bull to be betrayed like this .
When should the royal day be ?
Is that how the law sees it ?
You're kidding !
Your wild actions resemble the irrational fury of a beast .
What ?
Like that .
Go away and let me die .
I don't even have one to throw at a dog .
If her breath steams up the glass , then she's alive .
He pretended to be some kind of sorcerer , and he gazed in my eyes and took my pulse .
Your old age and the prospect of death are making you imagine things .
I know that she is worthy of that love .
To save her life , I'll say she doesn't .
Bring in more wine !
I do too , my lord .
A cat in heat will look for a mate , And Rosalind certainly will too .
Well , he keeps the devil away as well as a man can in his situation .
This is the roof under which Lorenzo said to meet him .
I wish I'd been there .
Do you want to know what I wrote ?
Keep an eye on her , Moor .
I know you'll say "yes , " and I'll believe you .
To our horses , you gallant princes .
Look , here I have Macbeth's cursed head .
No lie , she screamed at you .
How long has he been possessed like this ?
Come , gentlemen , let's go in .
No , that's not it , trust me .
Come , ask me to do anything for you .
Oh , I wish you'd never been born !
How tragic !
Is Horatio here too ?
What are you going to do for a father ?
Well , that's really my job .
I can't wait to hear him call the drunkard "husband , " and to watch my men smother their laughter as they pay their respects to this simple peasant .
I will catch up with you , Cleopatra , and weep for your forgiveness .
Can you imagine being hitched to a lump of clay ?
But please tell me , sir , is your marriage Let him do his worst .
I smile and think , "Thank goodness the wind doesn't flatter me : it's like a councilor who makes me feel what I'm really made of." Adversity can have its benefits , like the ugly , poisonous I wouldn't change my situation for anything .
Will I hear from you soon ?
Your mother .
Will you have dinner with me tonight , Casca ?
You're on very good terms with the duke of Exeter .
Tell the constable that .
Just go after him and watch what he does next .
Are you still set on marrying my brother's daughter ?
They ought to be whipped for being so stupid .
They're forgiven , then , if they don't see what they're doing .
She's cold .
He's not wise enough to be brave .
The wound can't be that bad .
In the high and mighty Roman Empire , just before the emperor Julius Caesar was assassinated , corpses rose out of their graves and ran through the streets of Rome speaking gibberish .
So be it .
Hang him immediately .
I was too young at the time to appreciate her value , but now I know her .
You imply that married men are fools .
I've looked at many ladies with pleasure , and been
Hear the shrill whistle that brings order to the hubbub .
This is rebellion .
Have I accomplished so much in battle , but now I'm afraid to tell some old men the truth ?
I must and will have Katherine for my wife .
You've made him so delusional he'll go crazy when he learns the truth .
I'll reward treason with blows , I promise you .
It looks to me like it's burning in the Capulet tomb .
But so what ?
Quiet !
I appreciate your frankness and your brevity .
He almost begs for the opportunity to help you .
Signior Leonato , listen to the friar's plan .
Hurry , Messala , and I'll look for Pindarus in the meantime .
What's this ?
A duke who is noble in name and character .
Give me my robe , because I'm going .
Is it daytime ?
Please , write down "Borachio." , And yours ?
Carriage" makes it sound like it's pulling around a cannon .
Travelers have never told lies , no matter what the fools at home accuse them of .
Goodbye !
The fire is ready .
I'll get her , but I won't keep her long .
You're rubbing salt in his wounds when you should be applying bandages .
I beg your pardon , I thought it was me whom you were calling all those terrible names .
Please spare my innocent wife and children ! , Kind warden , please stay with me for a while .
What's important is the urgency of this mission .
You may be exaggerating the risks .
Give him this deed and have him sign it .
To kill the boys with the luggage !
We're friends !
I'd rather overload my liver with wine than starve my heart by denying myself fun .
Oh , Caesar !
Come in out of the storm .
I'm backed into a corner with nowhere to run .
But here comes Antony. , Welcome , Mark Antony .
Absolutely everything .
Then sure ones .
Is it really true ?
I'd give up my life and take my son's place in the mud on the ocean floor if I could see them alive in Naples. , When did you lose your daughter ?
You're like one of those guys who walks into a bar , slams his sword on the table , and then says , "I pray I never have to use you." By the time he orders his second drink , he pulls his sword on the bartender for no reason at all .
That's true .
Now tell me how long you intend to keep her .
I want the law , the penalty , and the fulfillment of my contract .
Right , and they wore proclamations around their necks , saying , "Be it known to all men by these The eldest of the three brothers wrestled with Charles , the duke's wrestler .
What can I do for you ?
We three couples will celebrate with a sumptuous feast .
Tell them to slick down their hair , brush their blue coats , and make sure their socks match .
I don't think he wants to be anywhere but where he is .
Tom will chase them off. , Go away , you mongrels !
Run as if your life depended on it .
If I can just get him to drink one more glass after what he's drunk already , he'll be as argumentative and eager to fight as a little dog .
That's very soon .
The gods know , Oh , never has a queen been so betrayed as I have been .
If I can bear that pain , then I can bear my husband's secrets .
What do you think that means ?
You said those exact things to me back in the marketplace .
But when we have an hour to spare we can talk more about it , if you're willing .
Or it's bottomless , at least : pour affection in one end , and it runs out the other .
But what's the upshot of her admiration ?
That's right , you stupid thing .
She's weak and will die unless you comfort her .
Why ?
Hey , look over there !
Are you a suitor to the girl we speak of , yes or no ?
Good night , madam .
He's a raven with the feathers of the dove .
Farewell , brother .
If its juice is put on someone's eyelids while they're asleep , that person will fall in love with the next living creature he or she sees .
I'll be crippled forever !
There's two , a man and a woman .
Who's she ?
That her father's brother wants to be her husband ?
Ah , here comes my messenger. , What's going on , you crazy spirit ?
She is welcome to stay .
Good thinking .
Such a kind father ! , Are my horses ready ?
How are you feeling , Malvolio ?
Every person I meet greets me like an old friend , and every one of them knows my name .
Oh , shut up .
And after this I'll be good and hope you forgive me .
Hello , Roderigo !
Boys , how are you both doing ?
Every glass of liquor is damned , and the devil's the main ingredient !
You won't be striking me down , but defeating Caesar .
I led them on in this frightened , distracted state , and left sweet
Now summon up the image of stealthy murmurs and engulfing darkness filling the wide vessel of the universe .
I'll read it to you .
If that's true , it makes up for all the sorrows I've ever known .
Tell us your name , sir , truthfully .
No we're not , it's night .
Don't you know he has ?
You expect me to cry ?
She mocks all her suitors so severely that they drop the suit .
Please come with me .
I can't go any further .
Hey , naked guy , Poor Tom's chilly .
I pray that the mighty gods defend you !
Here's money for you .
Oh-ho-ho , sir !
I knew Temperance , she was a fine girl .
I will either get you out , lying if I have to , or stay in prison in your place .
That's not what I wish .
They are his dung , and he their beetle .
And I will give you some more .
May I kiss your feet ?
But don't go .
Make room for Antony , most noble Antony !
You told me you hated him .
Isn't he the one who's always , " and so on .
Educated men are so impressive !
Look out , I'm on my way up .
The lack of time and the risk I'm under will have to keep us from bonding and catching up on each other's news the way we usually would after not seeing each other for so long .
Don't joke about his predictions .
And I've been avoiding him all day .
Your ear is good .
They still haven't joined the battle .
The gods know how dearly Caesar loved him !
Are you riding far ?
Time to buy myself a mirror and employ a few dozen tailors to dress me up in the current fashions .
But I paid attention to where Cupid's arrow fell .
Gertrude , don't drink that .
Get up from your beds as if you were rising out of your own graves , and walk like ghosts to come witness this horror .
I hope Antonio repays his loan on time , or he'll suffer for this .
I'm telling you , this house is dark .
One smile from him would repair my decayed beauty .
I can't blame her .
Don't sleep so close to me .
I see Regan and Goneril in hell , A thousand hissing devils with sizzling red pitchforks come up to them !
Should we all give up and drown ?
Are they getting rusty ?
You must understand , Silius , that it's better to leave something undone than achieve too much fame in your superior's absence .
There's a ransom .
And if I were king of it , you know what I'd do ?
You are welcome for his sake .
I have it on me here .
Why did you leave your wife and child vulnerable , the most precious things in your life , those strong bonds of love ?
Give me a goblet. , Hamlet , this pearl's yours .
Mistress , I swear on my life that it's true .
Go on .
Help us carry these clothes to where my barrel of wine is hidden , or I'll kick you out of my kingdom .
I doubt it's anything but the obvious reason : his father's dying and our quick marriage .
How dangerous to have this madman on the loose !
And then return to you and nothing else ?
Sheep pens are empty in the middle of the flooded fields , and the crows get fat from eating the dead bodies of infected sheep .
She shall , Lucentio .
What's that supposed to mean ?
Give him this letter .
No , good Sir Toby .
Her body sleeps in the Capulet tomb , and her immortal soul lives with the angels in heaven .
As I was standing watch on the hill , I looked toward Birnam , and I thought I saw the forest begin to move .
Would I dare do something like that ?
It's driven me crazy .
What do you believe ?
Oh , please , Prince Dauphin !
What are these warlike noises ?
Their hounds are unequaled in courage .
We're strangers here .
Wake up the moon goddess with a hymn !
No , he refused it publicly , in open court .
Do you want to go hunting , my lord ?
Is that so ?
When I fell in love with Othello I made up my mind that I wanted to live with him .
I make the laws , not you .
I was conceived by a woman , and I thank her very much for all her effort .
But this storm in my mind keeps me from feeling anything except what's tormenting me , how ungrateful my children are !
What do you think about Thursday ?
No , you monstrous hags , I'll get revenge on you both that will make the whole world, I will do such things , I don't know what I'll do exactly , but it'll be devastating .
I hope you're right .
So I'll stay here for a while .
Look , Lucius , here's the book I was searching for .
Sit down , worthy friends .
His body will lie in my tent tonight , with the honorable observance that suits a soldier .
But gentle heavens , don't keep me waiting .
Take him to my sleeping area .
Blab my nonsense ?
I hear what they say about him for doing that .
I think I can find him .
I do think Scotland is sinking under Macbeth's oppression .
Which one of them did it ?
It's good for your fresh wound and your bloody noggin .
The name suits your fierceness .
We've been waiting a long time for this day .
Your eldest daughters destroyed themselves and died in despair .
She fainted at the sight of them bleeding .
There he is at the window .
Calphurnia !
Whoa , man , you dare to support someone who's been proclaimed a traitor ?
No , no , I can't , really .
What's with you , my lord ?
This wicked man will be brought face to face with Margaret , who I believe was hired by Don John to take part in this plot .
I like you guys .
Ha , ha !
I don't have a lord .
He's waiting nearby to find out if you'll invite him in .
He's late .
Well , let's hope your good fortune continues !
Here she comes , the brilliant fool-catcher .
Forever and forever , farewell , Brutus !
Then she has no choice but to hate you , as you purchased her love with murder .
Since I was so drawn to studying things like logic , grammar , geometry , and astronomy , I let my control of the government slide a bit , being too wrapped up in my occult books .
I will live in your heart , die in your lap , and be buried in your eyes , and , what's more , I will go with you to your uncle's .
Go ahead , swear to that , so you'll be damned to hell for lying .
No , that I don't remember .
Go ahead , then .
It is well done , and appropriate for a princess who has descended from so many royal kings .
I won't break this promise .
You're a natural-born philosopher !
Look , my little spirit is sitting in a foggy cloud waiting for me .
Yes , sir .
Baby blooms are most susceptible to disease .
On me , though I am limping and deformed ?
Give me your hand .
No , I know that you're Signior Lucentio .
Who are you ?
It's leaping about like a frisky horse .
Leah gave it to me before we were married .
How did you learn about this ?
Call my knights together .
Now , good-bye .
We human beings don't control our own destinies .
Master , should I watch the door ?
Here comes another group looking for you .
I'm going to let him live .
You didn't go to sleep , then ?
Come on , boy .
I know my rights .
Calphurnia !
There's good reason to escape when there's no mercy to be found anymore .
Has Caesar gone to the Capital yet ?
Are you still so cruel ?
They're certainly a peaceful couple !
Take me to the garden .
It is better to be tricked completely than to only suspect a little .
Some tardy cripple must have taken the counter-order , who came after Clarence was already buried .
The law allows it , and the court awards it .
Well , give me the worst news .
You know me too well .
She was tricked , divorced , wronged , spited , killed !
But if she can't love you , sir ?
I must go in .
Richard loves Richard , that is , there's just me and myself here .
He's definitely the most active gentleman of France .
That's the beginning of the day we see , but I don't think we'll see the end of it. , Who goes there ?
Are my master and his wife coming , Grumio ?
Demetrius doesn't think so , and that's all that matters .
Demetrius is an admirable man .
Skip over all the particularities between then and Harry's return to France .
But I need to remember I'm related to him by blood , not behavior .
Your words are idiotic .
I've been dishonored : I arranged for a friend of mine to marry a common whore .
Taurus !
Come to think of it , I thought I felt a scab there .
But as for this ring , please excuse me .
For God knows how many healthy men will shed their blood in support of whatever you persuade me to do .
Good friend , " he said , "say that the faithful Roman sends an oyster's treasure to the great Queen of Egypt , and that he plans to enhance this meager gift by adding new kingdoms to her empire .
That'll be fine .
I don't really understand what you mean .
Stephano !
Here comes my lord .
Don't mess with me .
Goodbye , dear Father .
Go disguise yourself as a sea nymph .
That's well spoken .
I'm completely lost .
And why did you come ?
Go after him and try to calm him down a little .
Here come Brabantio and the brave Moor .
Was someone as beautiful as you meant to be a whore ?
Maybe it's an English tailor who liked to skimp on the fabric for people's clothes .
Oh , now I really need that priest who spoke to me today !
That will tell you a lot .
The Duke's in a meeting ?
If that's true , which it is , she might as well be in love with a dream , the poor lady .
It's only for your willing and receptive ear .
Oh , but these are our friends .
A lovely , cunning shore can distract a man from the perils of a stormy sea , just as a pretty scarf can hide a dangerous dark-skinned beauty .
I swear , , each actor arrived on his ass .
Why aren't the leaves withering now that the sap is all dried up ?
I'll tell you more later about when and where we met , how we fell in love , and how we exchanged promises , but now I'm begging you : please , agree to marry us today .
A friend ?
Did you hit your head ?
The letters he spoke of may help me .
Will you dine with me tomorrow ?
And in return for this gift , he wishes you to drop your claim to the dukedoms .
I know I won't please you .
I'll give the Jew my flesh , blood , bones , and everything before you lose one drop of blood for me .
I don't really want to do this , but he's given me good reasons .
That's right , she did .
If you thought that you'd be thinking too much .
Ratcliffe !
Mighty duke , look here and see a man who's been treated most terribly !
This guy is exactly the kind of person your sister warned us about. , Come on , bring in the stocks , now !
Not of killing him , because I have a warrant for it , but of being damned for killing him , which no warrant can protect me from .
I'm starting to feel murderous urges .
If you're not having sex with Desdemona tomorrow night , then I suggest you find some way to stab me in the back and kill me .
Get out of here !
Doesn't anyone else want to see this , and hear breath wheezing out from broken ribs ?
All this so suddenly ? , Edmund , what's going on ?
I found that handkerchief by accident and gave it to my husband .
A woman who was beautiful but never proud , who could speak well but knew when to be quiet , who dressed well but was never overdressed , who had self-restraint even when she could get what she wanted , a woman who never took revenge , who overlooked it when people hurt her , who was too wise to do anything stupid , who could think without revealing her thoughts , and who could refrain from flirting with men in love with her , that kind of woman , if she ever existed , would , Would do what ?
What are you doing here ?
And you , good farmers , whose limbs were made in England , show us here the vigor of your upbringing .
I beg your pardon .
That's how we'll do it , then .
You see that any morals she has left are preventing her from denying the charges : she doesn't want to add perjury to her list of sins .
She's always talking when I want to sleep .
Oh , say it , and mean it !
So , where's my wife ?
Therefore , depart , and leave him here with me .
These sweet thoughts relieve me and refresh me , especially when I'm slaving away busily .
Iago is gesturing for me to come closer .
Be quiet , you mumbling fool !
It's pretty well done , isn't it ?
They certainly will .
We will wait on you , your majesty .
Why are you doing this ?
He's starving me to death .
Listen to me , madam .
I won't trouble you so much as to wake you .
I won't take it .
You interpret my words in a melancholy sense , my hearty friends .
Let them judge us however they please .
Listen to Antony .
Who will thank us now ?
But you're too good a friend for me to wish her on you .
Against my brother Lucius ?
I hope all reports about me simply tell the truth , no more or less .
I didn't take any more pains bringing this message than you took pains in thanking me." That's like saying , "Any thing I do for you is as easy as saying 'thank you.'" If this doesn't move me to take pity on her , I'm a horrible person .
If we don't obey them , they'll suck the life out of us or pinch us black and blue .
Remember that Hamlet is young and has a lot more freedom to fool around than you do .
They'll set their watches to whatever time we say .
I know a lady in Venice who'd walk all the way to Palestine for a kiss from him .
Go into the bedroom and see for yourself .
I don't like the way he's acting , and it's not safe for me to let his insanity get out of control .
Do you really think there's a man fool enough to marry into hell , however rich the father is ?
Pompey is making the most of our absence .
You don't know why we came to visit you , Yes , and so unexpectedly , at night .
He has a very gloomy attitude .
When will there be another like him ?
If you choose the one that contains my picture , we'll be married right away .
If I were Brutus now and Brutus were me , I wouldn't have let him influence me .
Oh , do you think we'll ever meet again ?
Here's my key .
He will , sir , if He wants to .
Now go , leave me .
He will be given safe conduct and money for his passage home .
The whole world wants her .
Since you left , I've been enjoying the sweetest sleep and most promising dreams I've ever had , my lords .
It has been done already , and the messenger is on his way .
And when the mind is engaged , the rest of the body , dead and dull before , wakes up and comes to life with a new nimbleness and sensitivity , like a snake shedding its dead skin .
Now he'll sit under a Let's go .
But how is it possible that Prospero's alive and well and living on this island ?
That really is an illegitimate hope .
Oh , what an excellent young man !
The question is , how would being king change him ?
Whatever you are , thanks for your advice .
No , villain , but you didn't work alone .
Did God make him ?
Oh , what a relief !
The French ambassador arrived at that moment and asked to see the king .
My lord , he's afraid you mean him harm .
Oh , my , it's my husband .
I've only given the articles a cursory glance .
Otherwise , forgive me , but if you should die before him , what becomes of her dowry ?
This song's about my dead father .
them brothers , friends , and countrymen .
Isn't my fortune just a little better than hers ?
But why am I telling you this ?
Who , him ?
I thank your Highness .
As long as you move gracefully , look handsome , and say nothing , I'm yours for the dance .
Tell her we mean her no disrespect .
Get yourself to a convent , fast .
She has a body , not a life .
What's the matter ?
Your joke is a very bitter apple .
I'll do everything a younger man could do for you .
But Caesar ignores offers that don't give him an advantage , and so should you .
He is worth more mourning than that , and I will mourn for him .
Therefore the dukes of Berri , Bretagne , Brabant , and Orleans shall advance , and you , Prince Dauphin , will swiftly entrench and fortify our fortress towns with men of courage and the means to defend themselves .
Oh God , I have a soul that predicts evil things !
If there are any , speak , for it is he whom I've offended .
Then I rebel against you , stars !
He thinks that since his fortune is twenty times better than yours , it would be like pitting twenty men against one .
Please !
I did too , and he also swore he would marry her tonight .
And so , ?
Amen to that , from the bottom of my heart .
Her eyes are saying something .
I'm not .
What ?
The earth sings when he touches it .
Wasn't Charles , the duke's wrestler , here to speak with me ?
I needn't be ashamed of your Majesty , God be praised , so long as your Majesty is an honest man .
No , my cousin , don't wish that even one man who is now in England were here instead .
I don't think so , my lord .
I hope we've corrected that fault pretty well in our company , sir .
And I'll neigh like a horse and bark like a hound and grunt like a pig and roar like a bear and burn like a fire at every turn .
Now , what kind of entertainment do we have to fill up the long three hours between dinner and bedtime ?
What have I said in my grief ?
No , I've had my say .
Sometimes snakes wrap around me , hissing at me with their forked tongues till I go crazy .
Consider how young you are , and question your feelings .
You've described a warm friend who's cooling off .
Did a dragon ever hide in such a beautiful cave ?
What heir of the York family is there alive other than myself ?
But you don't look as if you bring good news .
My lord , His Majesty wanted me to tell you that he's placed a large bet on you .
I don't know , sir .
You couldn't find out anything about them ?
That's the truth .
Cheer up !
With the help of the grim The first to greet me there was my great
Oh painful , painful , painful day !
You , sir ?
Quiet !
Aren't you dead yet ?
Officers , what crime have these men committed ?
He only married out of political necessity .
What a shameless jerk you are to pretend you don't know me !
I don't want her .
No , to the Whitefriars monastery .
Oh , if you are the same Egeon , speak now , and speak to that same Emilia !
Well then , don't bother .
Go get my best clothes .
He can't like her very long .
Well , my friends , you've got to admit that if you scare the living daylights out of the ladies , they'd have no choice but to execute us .
Should I believe that death is in love with you , and that the awful monster keeps you here to be his mistress ?
She can't hurt you , Helena .
It is not nighttime now .
Therefore , my old age is like a blustery winter : cold , but kindly .
Again !
I'm saying it to the girl who isn't here and doesn't hear me .
They pulled out the guts of the sacrificed animal and couldn't find its heart .
He's only known you for three days , but he's already treating you like a close friend .
Were you talking about Juliet ?
Challenge the count's young servant to a fight .
Oh , please do .
Oh Portia , these are some of the worst words that ever stained a piece of paper .
Oh , holy Friar , Oh , tell me , holy Friar , where is my lady's husband ?
Here come two of Duke Senior's pages .
I'll vouch for Grumio .
I have to admit that when I saw his suicide during rehearsal , I had tears in my eyes , but they were tears of laughter .
No , you don't need to worry about us , Lorenzo .
We'll let you .
He would never have spoken to me like this .
And you , sir , had me arrested over that necklace .
I wouldn't allow any commerce .
I mistook you for that sly Venetian woman who married Othello. , You whorehouse-keeper .
Tell me .
Call up your courage .
I'm going to Count Orsino's court .
Any man who knows how to write can answer a letter .
Then go gather your men , but leave behind your son , George Stanley .
Princes travel across deserts and the vast wilderness of Arabia to come see the beautiful Portia .
Where ?
Lucentio !
Oh wife , look at how our daughter bleeds !
Really , I'll help .
Get up , I tell you !
Ever since I've been a free agent in my choice of friends , I've chosen you because you take everything life hands you with calm acceptance , grateful for both good and bad .
A friend .
Then a third of the world is drunk .
Take her to my tent .
But to say that Tybalt's dead and then say , "Romeo has been banished." To say that is like saying that my father , my mother , Tybalt , Romeo , and Juliet have all been killed , they're all dead .
With anger , with fever , or with hunger , sure , my friend , but never sick with love .
Then why am I worried ?
When he loses that , he'll be drinking salt water , since I'll never tell him where the freshwater springs are .
Nurse ?
Yes , he said something in Greek .
Why , sweet Othello , I haven't done anything to deserve this !
Killed ?
Will you come immediately ?
I ask you , if you've kept this a secret , keep doing so .
Dat it not be de custom pour les ladies of France , I can not tell vat is To kiss .
Let him think about his own debt .
Look for yourself , see the top of the cliff way up there ?
He's definitely drunk now .
I have only come in , like the others have , to try to fight him with the strength of my youth .
Well , there you go .
It was Kent , sir , the exiled Kent , who , after the king treated him like an enemy of the state , put on a disguise and followed his king , carrying out tasks unworthy of even a slave .
By my faith in love , I will , then .
I could drown the world .
It'd be better to be delirious and unaware of anything .
What's this , you dog ?
I don't think so .
Stop right there !
You take my house away when you take the money I need for upkeep .
You admit it , then ?
But what do you say to my request ?
Meanwhile , I'd be gratified if you'd live and eat your food .
Take it to heart , Dorset .
Where , sir ?
Oh , what misery !
Don't insult my master's generosity by killing yourself .
I'll pay you .
That's like hot ice and strange snow .
You must be ready for revenge , too , when you hear me out .
Please , your Grace , tell me what crime I have committed .
Our knocking woke him up .
Listen to this , King : as soon as we sent those Irish soldiers running for cover , the Norwegian king saw his chance to attack us with fresh troops and shiny weapons .
You were the prettiest baby I ever nursed .
Get out of my sight , or I'll give you what you deserve and spoil Caesar's victory .
still fight you and embed your lies back in your hellish heart. , Trumpets , blow !
But I won't shed any of her blood or scar that beautiful skin , whiter than snow and smooth as the finest marble .
Morning's here .
Where is my Romeo ?
There's a farmer here who won't leave without seeing your Highness .
My girlfriend has beautiful white hands , and great warriors aren't Ha , ha !
You saw my master wink and laugh at you ?
I've relinquished my authority , so please , I'll see you all before long .
But will I wear these honors for only a day or will I enjoy them for a long time ?
I met this man with my glove in his cap , and I have been as good as my word .
No , if you struggle with me , Just half an hour !
Tybalt , I have a reason to love you that lets me put aside the rage I should feel and excuse that insult .
By risking the second arrow , I'd often get both of them back .
He's standing ready outside the door .
Oh , is that so ?
If she was young and passionate , she'd move as fast as a ball .
Tonight I'll throw through his window a few letters in different handwriting , as if they came from several citizens , all testifying to the great respect Romans have for Brutus , and all alluding to Caesar's unseemly ambition .
And why's that ?
Let's stay and watch a while .
I'll bury you in a magnificent grave .
We're being haunted .
It won't matter .
I won't live long enough , and all my efforts will fail me .
If it pleases you , your highness , why don't you sit with us and grace us with your royal company ?
I have no idea what you're talking about , Hamlet .
What's going on ?
I'm no villain .
I'll stand , and so will Trinculo .
What if I went no further and chose this one ?
In his ignorant jealousy , he'll totally misunderstand Cassio's smiles , gestures , and jokes. , How are you , lieutenant ?
We'll be ready when the time comes .
Tomorrow is the happy day , Audrey .
I'll tell her .
Don't delay .
Yes , I've been responsible for his upbringing .
Is it young Romeo ?
There'll be hell to pay for this .
No , not until we see a hot January .
But are they all safe , Ariel ?
Oh , are you really !
What do you want ?
Come , this way to the rowboat .
Tell them this , Publius .
I have responsibilities in this war , and as the absolute ruler of my kingdom I will carry out my duties as if I were a man .
You won't lose any respect .
Are your men searching for him ?
I want you there and back again before I can even tell you what you should do there .
Shut up , you troublemaker , no more of that .
Farewell , then , Signior Lucentio .
Oh , he's a gallant king !
No , don't press up against me .
I'd deny whatever evidence you had against me , even if it were in my own handwriting , and turn it all into evidence against you and your plans for treachery .
Don't keep anything back , I insist .
Easily , madam .
What's the matter ?
What , would you have me beg for my food ?
I didn't kill Lysander .
Okay , so that's when he'll say we stabbed him in his sleep .
But I can't be too obvious about being on your side without risking the life of your stepbrother , young George .
There's something else .
I willingly accept your offer and put my future in your hands .
Call that servant back .
Tell the actors to hurry .
And now you claim you gave it to a judge's clerk !
No lady could be more miserable than I if you two disagree .
You won't leave this grove until I've paid you back for this insult .
Coward !
He is , because he told Antonius to tell you he'd be there tomorrow .
I swear to God I'll get revenge .
And what are you going to do with it ?
Indeed , it's a strange time .
Since Macbeth went to war , I have seen her rise from her bed , put on her nightgown , unlock her closet , take out some paper , fold it , write on it , read it , seal it up , and then return to bed , remaining asleep the entire time .
It is the best horse in Europe .
Heaven keep you safe !
Good morning , my friends .
Where are your leather apron and your ruler ?
He was also shocked to learn that on the same day you fought the rebels you also fought against the army of Norway , and that you weren't the least bit afraid of death , even as you killed everyone around you .
Holy Franciscan Friar !
Good old knight , gather them all together at my tent .
But in your daughter's womb I will bury them .
What was the second noise for ?
Yes , that's why you have to die .
Good , here's the stretcher .
The sun is up and we're wasting the day !
Then you must take the truth I have to tell like a Roman .
Yes , my lord , if you give us permission .
I'm dying to hear your life story , which must be a strange tale .
Were you born here in the forest ?
I never caused her any harm , as far as I know .
Stop , Demetrius !
For a while , no play was sold to the theaters without a big fight between the children's playwright and the actors playing adult roles .
Let fortune and victory be yours !
In his heart ?
I can't run away .
Then , at my farm I have a hundred milk cows , a hundred and twenty fat oxen in my stables , and all the equipment necessary to maintain them .
There's still the King of France's farewell ceremony .
I will , my lord .
If you were a woman , I'd hug you now and cry , and say "Welcome back , drowned Viola ! " My father had a mole on his forehead .
Take his sword away from him .
Oh , Regan , Goneril , your kind old father whose generous heart gave you everything , Oh , if I think about that I'll go mad .
Well , let's go on .
Say that I hope he never has cause to look for a new master .
I've wanted to see you for a long time now , but I sent for you so hastily because I need your help right away .
Here's some money for you .
Beware of jealousy , my lord !
But then I do you wrong to say as much , since you are the very embodiment of bravery .
But I can't help laughing to think that the baby stopped crying and said , "Yes." I swear , she had a bump on her forehead as big as a rooster's testicle .
Lunatics , lovers , and poets all are ruled by their overactive imaginations .
It's a good shilling , I promise you .
How's it going , Shylock ?
I'm off .
Just imagine some lady might exist who loves you as powerfully and agonizingly as you love Olivia .
Let rivers flood and fiends howl for food !
When we were alone , we agreed that in public she would go on being unpleasant .
St. George loses his holiness once Then , by myself , You've misused yourself .
Ha ha , are you good ?
Just remember that he is Caesar .
Stop crying .
See how he stands between two clergymen !
They'll kill us !
If we are slated to die , the fewer , the better for our country , and if we're slated to live , the fewer men , the greater the share of honor for each of us .
I know you're my oldest brother , and deserve more respect .
If everyone here knows us but we don't know anybody , it's time , I think , for us to pack our bags and take off .
Is he dead ?
They're ready , my lord .
He's a stylish man .
Amen to that !
I am friends with you all and love you all , on one condition , that you prove to me that Caesar was dangerous .
Since you asked , I suppose it's not bragging to say that we are .
Everything's ready .
Sadly , it's the king that's missing .
What are you doing ?
The bitter one is the other one , that's you.LEAR Are you calling me a fool , boy ?
Well , the point is , he's lost a ship .
Let everyone beware : I can shake off the tyranny that now oppresses me whenever I choose .
Your friends are up and buckling on their armor .
Well , that's what you get to do .
What , my lord ?
They howl about banishment .
Well , I'll turn pimp and do some occasional pickpocketing .
You , I think , would best know what he's thinking .
Do it well , and then leave us .
Oh , my son , what issue is that ?
Something's wrong .
Damn it !
Please hear what Goneril is saying .
We killed those men and sent them to rest in peace so that we could gain our own peace .
Do you know Fluellen ?
No , you can't sign a contract like that for me !
Where are you now ?
If someone like me is fit to be king , let me know .
Well , go on your way , then .
Cicero is dead , by their decree .
And I'll tell him about the letter too .
No !
My soul will keep yours company on the way to heaven .
What a painful condition responsibility is .
An illicit kiss !
No , advancement to the dignity and height of honor , to a high , imperial kind of glory .
Come , help me bang on the door , master .
How is that possible ?
Give me another horse !
Because then I'd have to shed an ounce or two of your impudent blood .
What does the lead box say ?
The other day I saw him defeated in a
Please , don't mention her .
On my honor and by my word , if you outstay the ten days , you will die .
You mean this is the whole problem , that she is shy and hasn't said everything she means to say and do ? , My lord of Burgundy , what do you have to say to this lady ?
Neither my husband nor the slave has returned , even though I sent the slave off running .
It's impossible .
The fool's nice enough , but he's such a huge eater , and slow as a snail when he works .
What are you going to do for her ?
