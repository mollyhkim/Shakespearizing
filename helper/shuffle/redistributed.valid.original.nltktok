Death , traitor !
Fury , Fury ! , There , Tyrant , there .
My face I'll grime with filth , Blanket my loins , elf all my hair in knots , And with presented nakedness outface The winds and persecutions of the sky .
What is this ?
So were you .

Go and importune her .
Fortune is an excellent moral .
Heavens make our presence and our practices Pleasant and helpful to him !
Now , sir , what make you here ?
In respect that it is solitary , I like it very well ; but in respect that it is private , it is a very vile life .
And therefore as a stranger give it welcome .
Make your vaunting true , And it shall please me well .
I think our father will hence tonight .
I stretch it out for that word "broad , " which , added to the goose , proves thee far and wide a broad goose .
Go , sirrah , take them to the buttery And give them friendly welcome every one .

Ay , ay , three thousand ducats .
If you dare fight today , come to the field .
Shall they see us ?
But , sirrah , not for my sake , but your master's , I advise You use your manners discreetly in all kind of companies .
That , sir , which I will not report after her .
And so perchance may he be .
Send the deed after me , And I will sign it .
Now I arise .
For me , that I may surely keep mine oath , I will be married to a wealthy widow , Ere three days pass , which hath as long loved me As I have loved this proud disdainful haggard .
Where is Duncan's body ?
A worthy fool !

Get him to bed , and let his hurt be looked to .
My lord , my lord , I will not hear you .
That I love her , I feel .
Now , what news on the Rialto ?
Some five or six and thirty of his knights , Hot questrists after him , met him at gate , Who with some other of the lord's dependants Are gone with him towards Dover , where they boast To have well-armed friends .

Enobarbus , Antony Hath after thee sent all thy treasure , with His bounty overplus .

Petruchio is my name , Antonio's son , A man well known throughout all Italy .
Think , when we talk of horses , that you see them Printing their proud hoofs i ' th ' receiving earth , For 'tis your thoughts that now must deck our kings , Carry them here and there , jumping o'er times ,
I will go call the watch .
What committed ?
News , madam .
Speak to me home .

Think not I love him , though I ask for him .

I'll mend it and then play , Where's the Queen ?
And die in music .
The near in blood , The nearer bloody .

Not this , but troubles of the marriage bed .
O mistress , villainy hath made mocks with love !
Sweet Prince , you learn me noble thankfulness. , There , Leonato , take her back again .
I am no more mad than you are .
And may not young men die as well as old ?

O treachery !
Twas a rough night .
Well , my good fellows , wait on me tonight .
Nay , when I have a suit Wherein I mean to touch your love indeed It shall be full of poise and difficult weight And fearful to be granted .

Say boldly .
For Hamlet and the trifling of his favor , Hold it a fashion and a toy in blood , A violet in the youth of primy nature , Forward , not permanent , sweet , not lasting , The perfume and suppliance of a minute .
I can not be so answer'd .
If thou ask me why , sufficeth my reasons are both good and weighty .
Thou hast obtained thy suit .
But to be frank , and give it thee again .

Let this fellow Be nothing of our strife .
Your mistress bears well .
Saint Valentine is past .
My creditors grow cruel .
Believe me , I had rather have lost my purse Full of crusadoes .
God be wi ' you .
Hold , then .

Thy adversary's wife doth pray for thee .

Warrant thee , my man's as true as steel .
Say , Voltemand , what from our brother Norway ?
Most sure and vulgar .
But yet , alas , stood I within his grace , I would prefer him to a better place .
And I pray God grant them a fair departure .
Tis certain , every man that dies ill , the ill upon his own head .
If you prick us , do we not bleed ?
Thus hath the candle singed the moth .
I do know , When the blood burns , how prodigal the soul Lends the tongue vows .

Haste me to know 't , that I , with wings as swift As meditation or the thoughts of love , May sweep to my revenge .

Sometime she gallops o'er a courtier's nose , And then dreams he of smelling out a suit .

And I .
Haply when I shall wed That lord whose hand must take my plight shall carry Half my love with him , half my care and duty .
I'll drink to her as long as there is a passage in my throat and drink in Illyria .

So he laughed and let me go .
Tis mine and I will have it .
The music , ho !
You will be whipped .

Why , every day , tomorrow .
I would sing my song without a burden .
How now ?
And is not the grease of a mutton as wholesome as the sweat of a man ?
I must leave them and seek some better service .
I'll give 't him .
No shame but mine .
Even for that I thank you .
I will hear further reason for this .
Moneys is your suit .
I do beseech your Grace to pardon me , and withal Forbear your conference with the noble duke .
Will you walk , sir ? , O Desdemona , My lord ?
You are not , Cassius .

Her lord is come .
I am weary of you .
He hath not told us of the captain yet .
We say the king Is wise and virtuous , and his noble queen Well struck in years , fair , and not jealous .
I am afeard , Being in night , all this is but a dream , Too flattering sweet to be substantial .
I pray thee , hear me speak .
On what occasion God He knows , not I , The queen your mother and your brother York Have taken sanctuary .
Nay , I prithee now , with most petitionary vehemence , tell me who it is .

And can you by no drift of conference Get from him why he puts on this confusion , Grating so harshly all his days of quiet With turbulent and dangerous lunacy ?
Bear welcome in your eye , Your hand , your tongue .
how am I beset ! , What kind of catechizing call you this ?
God made him and therefore let him pass for a man .
Most certain .
I do suffer love indeed , for I love thee against my will .
Say you have wronged her , sir .
She In th' habiliments of the goddess Isis That day appeared , and oft before gave audience , As 'tis reported , so .

Is it not past two o'clock ?
What is this castle called that stands hard by ?
Which he will put on us as pigeons feed their young .
Tis he , that villain Romeo .
I attend them with all respect and duty .
Let our reciprocal vows be remembered .
Ask for me tomorrow , and you shall find me a grave man .
Is there no respect of place , persons , nor time in you ?
Meet presently at the palace .
For what advancement may I hope from thee That no revenue hast but thy good spirits , To feed and clothe thee ?
Madam ?
Who's there ?
True .
When saw you my father last ?
Peace , doting wizard , peace .
I think there's never a man in Christendom Can lesser hide his love or hate than he , For by his face straight shall you know his heart .
With the same 'havior that your passion bears Goes on my master's grief .
He is a proper man's picture , but alas , who can converse with a dumb show ?
Come , sir , away .
Whither , my lord ? , Cesario , husband , stay .
The watery kingdom , whose ambitious head Spits in the face of heaven , is no bar To stop the foreign spirits , but they come As o'er a brook to see fair Portia .

Oh , behold , The riches of the ship is come on shore !
O Harry's wife , triumph not in my woes !
We have used our throats in Egypt .
What noise is this ? , Not dead ?
And wilt thou have me ?
Let's have no more of this , let's to our affairs. , Forgive us our sins ! , Gentlemen , let's look to our business .
Where hast thou been , my heart ?
A bird of my tongue is better than a beast of yours .
Sweet Sir Toby , be patient for tonight .
That will I .
Note if your lady strain his entertainment
The day is spent .
For my part , I care not .
And be not jealous on me , gentle Brutus .

He that knows better how to tame a shrew , Now let him speak ; 'tis charity to show .
Tis vile , unless it may be quaintly ordered , And better in my mind not undertook .
How , how , how , how ?
Look what I have .
Though to have her and death were both one thing .
Your son and daughter found this trespass worth The shame which here it suffers .
I am your own for ever .
This is the sergeant Who like a good and hardy soldier fought 'Gainst my captivity .
Groan !
Had I as many mouths as Hydra , such an answer would stop them all .
The like is on her arm .
But hear thee , Gratiano .
But till this afternoon his passion Ne'er brake into extremity of rage .
A rarer spirit never Did steer humanity , but you gods will give us Some faults to make us men .
He hath .
Some of them will fall tomorrow , I hope .
A good direction , warlike sovereign .
Would that alone o ' love he would detain , So he would keep fair quarter with his bed .
I could never better stead thee than now .
Why then I think Cassio's an honest man .
I am an ass , indeed ; you may prove it by my long ears. , I have served him from the hour of my nativity to this instant , and have nothing at his hands for my service but blows .
More villain thou. , Well , push him out of doors And let my officers of such a nature Make an extent upon his house and lands .
It doth not fit me .
I have made no fault .
The earth , that's nature's mother , is her tomb .
Get you gone And hasten your return .
Nature wants stuff To vie strange forms with fancy , yet t' imagine An Antony were nature's piece 'gainst fancy , Condemning shadows quite .
Kent , on thy life , no more .
It is my arm .
And in this habit Met I my father with his bleeding rings , Their precious stones new lost , became his guide , Led him , begged for him , saved him from despair .
Are you a god ?
Presently .
It is the green-eyed monster which doth mock The meat it feeds on .
And come you now with "knocking at the gate" ?
Dighton and Forrest , whom I did suborn To do this piece of ruthless butchery , Albeit they were fleshed villains , bloody dogs , Melted with tenderness and mild compassion , Wept like two children in their deaths ' sad story .
Our time does call upon 's .
You see how easily she may be surprised .
Here , stand behind this bulk , straight will he come .
Art thou of Cornish crew ?
Meantime we thank you for your well-took labor .
What error drives our eyes and ears amiss ?
No .
Self-love , my liege , is not so vile a sin As self-neglecting .
Murder , murder !
I have it not about me .
Come , put mine armor on .
Think'st thou I'd make a life of jealousy , To follow still the changes of the moon With fresh suspicions ?
Gone ?
Set your heart at rest .
There , gentle Hermia , may I marry thee .
It is merely a lust of the blood and a permission of the will .
And from hence I go To make these doubts all even .
What should a man do but be merry ?
Be clamorous , and leap all civil bounds , Rather than make unprofited return .
Go to , you're a dry fool .
Have mind upon your health , tempt me no further .
Yes , certainly , and out of doubt and out of question , too , and ambiguities .
Flat burglary as ever was committed .
I care not if I have .
Go to my chamber , put on clothes of mine .
I'll follow him no more with bootless prayers .
What news ?
For he is , sure , i ' th ' island .
Here let them lie Till famine and the ague eat them up .
Ay , his breast .
Call my guard , I prithee .
But they'll nor pinch , Fright me with urchin-shows , pitch me i ' th ' mire , Nor lead me like a firebrand in the dark Out of my way , unless he bid 'em .
She had a prophesying fear Of what hath come to pass .
Nothing at all .
Behold , sir .
This was a venture , sir , that Jacob served for , A thing not in his power to bring to pass But swayed and fashioned by the hand of heaven .
Oh , If you but knew how you the purpose cherish Whiles thus you mock it !
And so have I addressed me .
Poor soul !
How have I been behaved that he might stick The small'st opinion on my least misuse ?
Did he live now ,
The soldier's pole is fall'n !
Thy husband .
You must awhile be patient .
Thou art sensible in nothing but blows , and so is an ass .
I would forget it fain , But oh , it presses to my memory , Like damned guilty deeds to sinners ' minds .
I doubt not of his temperance .
Ill luck , ill luck ?
Bliss be upon you !
Marry , that am I and my partner .
Very good .
For I will make him tell the tale anew Where , how , how oft , how long ago , and when He hath , and is again to cope your wife .
My noble uncle , do you know the cause ?
What , is the man lunatic ?
Here , thou incestuous , murderous , damned Dane , Drink off this potion .
Why , see you not ?
She is drowned already , sir , with salt water , though I seem to drown her remembrance again with more .
For better might we Have loved without this mean , if on both parts This be not cherished .
I guess at it .
What is a man If his chief good and market of his time Be but to sleep and feed ?
Why should that name be sounded more than yours ?
Well , we will leave you then till dinnertime .
I will hold friends with you , lady .
So do you too , where you perceive them thick .
Killing swine .
I doubt some danger does approach you nearly .
I heard myself proclaimed , And by the happy hollow of a tree Escaped the hunt .
Will you hear me , Roderigo ?
Farewell , good Launcelot .
Fare thee well !
My master is grown quarrelsome .
I would thou couldst stammer , that thou might'st pour this concealed man out of thy mouth as wine comes out of a narrow-mouthed bottle , either too much at once , or none at all .
If thou would have such a one , take me .
Nay , but hear me .
We took him for a coward , but he's the very devil incardinate .

His word might bear my wealth at any time .
I do defy thy commination And apprehend thee for a felon here .
What said my man , when my betossed soul Did not attend him as we rode ?
Your reasons are too shallow and too quick .
He is very well-favored , and he speaks very shrewishly .
Stars , my lord .
Alas , what danger will it be to us , Maids as we are , to travel forth so far ?
Well , praised be the gods for thy foulness ; sluttishness may come hereafter .
To what base uses we may return , Horatio .
My wits begin to turn. , Come on , my boy .
Good night , good brother .
It must be so , for miracles are ceased , And therefore we must needs admit the means How things are perfected .
Take heed , sirrah , the whip .
Ay , my good lord .
We never valued this poor seat of England And therefore , living hence , did give ourself To barbarous license , as 'tis ever common That men are merriest when they are from home .
Is it not as this mouth should tear this hand For lifting food to 't ?
Too well , too well .
Not th' imperious show Of the full-fortuned Caesar ever shall Be brooched with me .
I will be mild and gentle in my words .
They that have done this deed are honorable .
Therefore all hearts in love use their own tongues .
Well , stand aside. , 'Fore God , they are both in a ale .
Well , I would you did like me .
Why , what wouldst thou do there before I go ?
Good Father , I beseech you on my knees , Hear me with patience but to speak a word .
Wouldst thou aught with me ?
Think it no more .
Farewell .
You know I gave it you even now .
She soon shall know of us , by some of ours , How honorable and how kindly we Determine for her , for Caesar can not live To be ungentle .
Some to the common pulpits , and cry out , "Liberty , freedom , and enfranchisement ! " People and senators , be not affrighted .
How heavy weighs my lord !
Oh , strange !
For you know , nuncle , The hedge-sparrow fed the cuckoo so long , That it's had it head bit off by it young .
Horn mad , thou villain !
Tis true , this god did shake !
Your honor is most welcome .
First kiss me , Kate , and we will .
Thou 'lt be afraid to hear it .
What if it come to thee again ?
My master calls me .
Nay , I dare not swear it .
Take up her bed And bear her women from the monument .
By this kind of chase I should hate him , for my father hated his father dearly .
Heaven truly knows that thou art false as hell .
Yet his means are in supposition .
The one of them imports The death of Cassio to be undertook By Roderigo .
Have you no more to say ?
Is not this something more than fantasy ?
So fare you well till we shall meet again .
We must out and talk .
I pray thee , give it me .
What is 't , Ophelia , he hath said to you ?
This is the door .
Be it so , Lysander .
If not , I'll die your maid .
The gods reward your kindness !
Is this the Prince's brother ?
You shall be more beloving than beloved .
You shall have time to wrangle in when you have nothing else to do .
O Friar , the damned use that word in hell .
I ' faith , coz , 'tis he .
No , let me know , And knowing what I am , I know what she shall be .
Soft !
Thou sayst his meat was sauced with thy upbraidings .
He speaks to me. , I am your master , Dromio .
Will you enforce me to a world of cares ?
Stay here .
Beshrew me , if I would do such a wrong For the whole world .
But to read his right wits is to read thus .
We have cause to be glad that matters are so well digested .
I am never merry when I hear sweet music .
From all such devils , good Lord , deliver us !
He that has the two fair daughters , is 't he you mean ?
Tis partly my own fault , Which death or absence soon shall remedy .
These things are beyond all use , And I do fear them .
A plague o ' both your houses !
While grace is saying , hood mine eyes Thus with my hat , and sigh and say , "Amen" , Use all the observance of civility Like one well studied in a sad ostent To please his grandam , never trust me more .
A braggart , a rogue , a villain that fights by the book of arithmetic !
Lady Beatrice , have you wept all this while ?
Noble captain , come .
What with a torch !
Your heart's desires be with you .
What , my old worshipful old master ?
Go , get thee hence .
Sister , have comfort .
I do not desire he should answer for me , and yet I determine to fight lustily for him .
He can not speak , my lord .
I would have sworn it had , my lord , especially against Benedick .
Stay not to answer me , but get thee gone .
And look when I am king , claim thou of me The earldom of Hereford , and all the moveables Whereof the king my brother was possessed .
Their villainy goes against my weak stomach , and therefore I must cast it up .
Yea , and the best person too .
Not once , nor twice , but twenty times you have .
I heard him swear his affection .
But for which of my good parts did you first suffer love for me ?
Here come the officers .
You have done well by water .
Come , come .
Come , sir , I am for you .
Nay , he rubs himself with civet .
Bloody , bawdy villain !
Not now .
Tarry , sweet soul , for mine ; then fly abreast , As in this glorious and well-foughten field We kept together in our chivalry." Upon these words I came and cheered him up .
Or stole it , rather .
His excellence did earn it , ere he had it .
I owe you much , and , like a willful youth , That which I owe is lost .
Cancel his bond of life , dear God I pray , That I may live to say , "The dog is dead."
Signor Bassanio !
Am I the motive of these tears , my lord ?
Hear me , hear me what I say : he that strikes the first stroke , I'll run him up to the hilts , as I am a soldier .
Stoop , Romans , stoop , And let us bathe our hands in Caesar's blood Up to the elbows , and besmear our swords .
As he was valiant , I honor him .
How many gentlemen have you lost in this action ?
Tut , I have lost myself .
Where he arrives he moves All hearts against us .
Here comes the lady .
What wicked and dissembling glass of mine Made me compare with Hermia's sphery eyne ?
Do not weep , do not weep .
Call him hither to me , soldier .
Take heed you fall not .
There's none but witches do inhabit here , And therefore 'tis high time that I were hence .
See how yon justice rails upon yon simple thief .
Give me thy hand , Messala .
A sleeve ?
Good gentlemen , let me have leave to speak .
You'll not endure him !
What , man , courage yet !
So many miseries have crazed my voice That my woe-wearied tongue is still and mute .
He's gone , but his wife's killed .
Give me your arm .
O , you are novices !
I do but keep the peace .
Thou art the ruins of the noblest man That ever lived in the tide of times .
But I can tell you that of late this duke Hath ta'en displeasure 'gainst his gentle niece , Grounded upon no other argument But that the people praise her for her virtues And pity her for her good father's sake ; And , on my life , his malice 'gainst the lady Will suddenly break forth .
Now they are my men .
Thus doth he force the swords of wicked men To turn their own points in their masters ' bosoms .
Speak your office .
What beast was 't , then , That made you break this enterprise to me ?
Decius Brutus loves thee not .
I saw Othello's visage in his mind , And to his honors and his valiant parts Did I my soul and fortunes consecrate .
Therefore heaven nature charged That one body should be filled With all graces wide-enlarged .
I charge you , get you home .
That do I long to hear .
I will , my Hermia .
Go , one of you , find out the forester .
Are you not well ?
They shall be married tomorrow , and I will bid the duke to the nuptial .
But he that filches from me my good name Robs me of that which not enriches him And makes me poor indeed .
Follow" ?
I dreamt there was an emperor Antony .
I tell him we shall stay here at the least a month , and he heartily prays some occasion may detain us longer .
You do not mind the play .
Strike , drum .
Believe what ?
Swear by my sword .
What !
Stay , you imperfect speakers , tell me more .
Then heaven Have mercy on me !
It is a high-wrought flood .
I'll fetch my sister to get her goodwill .
His life I gave him and did thereto add My love , without retention or restraint , All his in dedication .
My lord , I can not .
We , Hermia , like two artificial gods , Have with our needles created both one flower , Both on one sampler , sitting on one cushion , Both warbling of one song , both in one key , As if our hands , our sides , voices , and minds , Had been incorporate .
Farewell .
I do so , I confess it .
Thou dost mean something .
Not I .
And her sister By her is poisoned .
thee aloud "England is thine , Ireland is thine , France is thine , and Harry Plantagenet is thine , " who , though I speak it before his face , if he be not fellow with the best king , thou shalt find the best king of good fellows .
Let heaven and men and devils , let them all , All , all cry shame against me , yet I'll speak .
If it will not be , I'll leave you .
Seek , seek for him , Lest his ungoverned rage dissolve the life That wants the means to lead it .
I prithee let me hear it .
Yes , sir , I have indeed .
I was , but I do find more pain in banishment Than death can yield me here by my abode .
Your looks are pale and wild , and do import Some misadventure .
And so good morrow to you every one .
Then shall I swear to Kate , and you to me , And may our oaths well kept and prosp'rous be .
These are not natural events .
Good fool , as ever thou wilt deserve well at my hand , help me to a candle , and pen , ink , and paper .
What is the matter , masters ? , Honest Iago , that looks dead with grieving , Speak , who began this ?
Your love says , like an honest gentleman , 'Where is your mother ?
Ay , and said nothing but what I protest intendment of doing .
Hast stolen it from her ?
His eyes are red as fire with weeping .
Yet I suppose him virtuous , know him noble , Of great estate , of fresh and stainless youth .
Right true it is your son Lucentio here Doth love my daughter and she loveth him , Or both dissemble deeply their affections .
He doth entreat your Grace , my noble lord , To visit him tomorrow or next day .
How is 't with me when every noise appals me ?
Let us come in , that we may bind him fast And bear him home for his recovery .
I want more uncles here to welcome me .
What's the disease he means ?
Farewell .
Grim death , how foul and loathsome is thine image !
How does my good Lord Hamlet ?
Good morrow , sweet Hero .
Twere best he speak no harm of Brutus here .
If he do , sure he can not weep 't back again .
Marry , before your ladyship , I grant , She puts her tongue a little in her heart And chides with thinking .
Why , gentle sweet , you shall see no such thing .
But heavenly Rosalind !
The younger rises when the old doth fall .
But I'll not chide thee .
Call you me "fair" ?
Ha , Portia ?
She will not .
I will not say so , for fear I should be faced out of my way .
Here comes my man .
And take good note What Caesar doth , what suitors press to him .
Here's to thee , Menas !
When I think , I must speak .
Be silent .
Know you any , Hero ?
We are blest that Rome is rid of him .
And his kissing is as full of sanctity as the touch of holy bread .
O noble Caesar !
Zounds , he dies !
But yet I'll go in hate to feed upon The prodigal Christian. , Jessica , my girl , Look to my house .
Yea , my lord .
Do so .
No , it is not possible you should love the enemy of France , Kate .
Myself and what is mine to you and yours Is now converted .
Highest queen of state , Great Juno , comes .
The nature of bad news infects the teller .
Then be 't so , my good lord. , How does the king ?
Ha !
Drown cats and blind puppies !
Here is the place , my lord .
Do thy worst .
Ah , good Demetrius , wilt thou give him me ?
My liege , this was my glove ; here is the fellow of it .
Well , my good lord , I'll do 't .
Break an hour's promise in love ?
Which of them shall I take ?
Alack the day , I know you not , young gentleman .
Then there is no true lover in the forest , else sighing every minute and groaning every hour would detect the lazy foot of time as well as a clock .
So is Lysander .
For even out of that will I cause these of Cyprus to mutiny , whose qualification shall come into no true taste again but by the displanting of Cassio .
Can heaven be so envious ?
Touch me not so near .
Fair princess , you have lost much good sport .
Every one prepare To follow this fair corse unto her grave .
It is not day .
The weight of this sad time we must obey .
I will not rise unless your Highness hear me .
Show 's the way , sir .
Brutus speaks .
By this light , a most perfidious and drunken monster .
What dost thou profess ?
I'll catch it ere it come to ground .
O , she tore the letter into a thousand halfpence , railed at herself that she should be so immodest to write to one that she knew would flout her .
How sweet the moonlight sleeps upon this bank !
No , sir .
Oh , ominous !
Either send the chain , or send me by some token .
That thou shalt see the difference of our spirit , I pardon thee thy life before thou ask it .
Who is 't that cried ?
I will plant you two , and let the fool make a third , where he shall find the letter .
I'll to dinner .
To both their deaths shalt thou be accessory .
Who was last with them ?
I have a thing for you .
I do confess my fault , And do submit me to Your Highness ' mercy .
You lie out on 't , sir , and therefore it is not yours .
No , not an oath .
Sweet-heart !
Nothing certainer .
What , did Caesar swoon ?
What he will do with it Heaven knows , not I. I nothing but to please his fantasy .
Oh , I am spoiled , undone by villains !
It is now two o'clock .
There is one within , Besides the things that we have heard and seen , Recounts most horrid sights seen by the watch .
I long that we were safe and sound aboard .
Meantime I writ to Romeo , That he should hither come as this dire night , To help to take her from her borrowed grave , Being the time the potion's force should cease .
Repays he my deep service With such deep contempt ?
Hadst thou done so , The kings that have revolted , and the soldier That has this morning left thee , would have still Followed thy heels .
The hand of death hath raught him .
My stomach is not constant .
The king mine uncle is to blame for it .
Someone take order Buckingham be brought To Salisbury .
What's her name ?
Yes , Captain , but with this acknowledgement : That God fought for us .
By heaven , you do me wrong !
If you went in pain , master , this knave would go sore .
To vail the title , as her mother doth .
A fiend like thee might bear my soul to hell .
I'll write to him a very taunting letter , And thou shalt bear it .
The French have reinforced their scattered men .
Thou 'rt mad to say it .
You have heard him swear downright he was .
The sky , it seems , would pour down stinking pitch , But that the sea , mounting to th ' welkin's cheek , Dashes the fire out .
Let it appear so .
Didst perceive ?
Therefore be patient .
Hence !
He hath lost his fellows And strays about to find 'em .
So young and so untender ?
Ay , madam , it is common .
No , 'twas the vane on the house .
Where's my cousin Toby ?
And O you mortal engines , whose rude throats The immortal Jove's dead clamors counterfeit , Farewell !
The duke must grant me that .
Well , well , We shall thrive now. , Seest thou , my good fellow ?
Oh , the people in the street cry "Romeo , " Some "Juliet , " and some "Paris , " and all run With open outcry toward our monument .
I'll tell thee more of this another time .
Name what part I am for and proceed .
Princes have but their titles for their glories , An outward honor for an inward toil ,
But I have , sir , a son by order of law , some year older than this , who yet is no dearer in my account .
This night I hold an old accustomed feast , Whereto I have invited many a guest Such as I love .
Is 't possible ?
Neighbors and friends , though bride and bridegroom wants For to supply the places at the table , You know there wants no junkets at the feast .
Where did I leave ?
Do you withdraw yourself a little while ,
By my knavery ( if I had it ) , then I were .
As if time were in debt .
Hast thou the flower there ?
We'll hear him what he says .
Your Highness bade me ask for it today .
Yet hear me , countrymen .
Counterfeit ?
I had rather be a country servant-maid Than a great queen with this condition , To be so baited , scorned , and stormed at .
Welcome , Iago .
If he , compact of jars , grow musical , We shall have shortly discord in the spheres .
Or any of your faction ?
Thou art translated .
I'll go along , no such sight to be shown , But to rejoice in splendor of mine own .
Tell him myself , the mayor , and aldermen , No less importing than our general good , In deep designs , and matters of great moment Are come to have some conference with his grace .
No , my good knight .
But here the lady comes .
Into a thousand that I have forgotten .
Maid's mild behavior and sobriety .
There's a great abatement of kindness appears as well in the general dependants as in the duke himself also , and your daughter .
The law hath yet another hold on you .
It would seem strange unto him when he waked .
And I .
Drunk ?
Pray , give me that .
Hear my excuse .
These gloves the Count sent me , they are an excellent perfume .
Ay , let her rot and perish and be damned tonight , for she shall not live .
Bespeak him a fortnight before. , I will have the heart of him if he forfeit , for were he out of Venice I can make what merchandise I will. , Go , go , Tubal , and meet me at our synagogue .
It shall be to your good , for my father's house and all the revenue that was old Sir Rowland's will I estate upon you , and here live and die a shepherd .
My ships come home a month before the day .
Abide within .
Ay , my good lord .
It is no hidden virtue in him .
Where is Lysander and fair Hermia ?
Ere he take ship for France , and in Southampton .
The children live whose fathers thou hast slaughtered , Ungoverned youth , to wail it in their age ; The parents live whose children thou hast butchered , Old barren plants , to wail it with their age .
Good friend , be gone .
Hold you still .
Back you shall not to the house , unless you undertake that with me which with as much safety you might answer him .
With all my heart , good youth .
Why , this was molded on a porringer !
Go you , call hither my fool .
Those are the raised father and his friends .
Thy spirits are most tall .
I dreamt last night of the three weird sisters : To you they have showed some truth .
Well , forward , forward !
Dear Duff , I prithee , contradict thyself , And say it is not so .
We both have fed as well , and we can both Endure the winter's cold as well as he .
Is that the chain you promised me today ?
O , sir , I will not be so hard-hearted .
Me , poor man , my library Was dukedom large enough .
When could they say till now , that talked of Rome , That her wide walks encompassed but one man ?
Trust me , I could do much , Prithee , no more .
Here , sir !
For God's love , let me hear .
He is now as valiant as Hercules that only tells a lie and swears it .
Good madam , patience .
I have been dear to him , lad , some two thousand strong , or so .
I thank thee for that gird , good Tranio .
Be assured We go to use our hands and not our tongues .
Let me go .
Better Macbeth Than such an one to reign .
Hath put himself from rest , And must needs taste his folly .
Who intercepts my expedition ?
Have you any commission from your lord to negotiate with my face ?
I will give you the minstrel .
So I do .
Come , Desdemona , I have but an hour Of love , of worldly matter and direction , To spend with thee .
Let me see his eyes , That , when I note another man like him , I may avoid him .
Stay !
Yet you have all the vantage of her wrong .
Hath not a Jew eyes ?
Tybalt , that murderer , which way ran he ?
Thou shalt not lose by it .
To you I am bound for life and education .
Why , what's the matter ?
Came he not home tonight ?
Help , help , O , help !
Do you doubt that ?
Piece out our imperfections with your thoughts .
I shall be there before thee .
The west yet glimmers with some streaks of day .
I think the best grace of wit will shortly turn into silence , and discourse grow commendable in none only but parrots .
The Duke's in council and your noble self , I am sure , is sent for .
Keep promise , love .
Pour in sow's blood , that hath eaten Her nine farrow ; grease that's sweaten From the murderer's gibbet throw Into the flame .
I pray you , sir , dispatch .
Ay , forsooth .
I peseech you heartily , scurvy , lousy knave , at my desires , and my requests , and my petitions , to eat , look you , this leek .
Nothing , madam .
I must remove Some thousands of these logs and pile them up , Upon a sore injunction .
News have I that my Nell is dead i ' th ' spital Of a malady of France , And there my rendezvous is quite cut off .
Hear you aught of her in yours ?
Nay , then , Well , well , th ' event .
I would the fool were married to her grave !
Do not presume too much upon my love .
But is he often thus ?
Lucius , who's that knocking ?
But he loves Caesar best ; yet he loves Antony .
Tis one Iago , ancient to the general .
Then one of you will prove a shrunk panel and , like green timber , warp , warp .
Who ?
Let me be your servant .
When they do choose , They have the wisdom by their wit to lose .
Set you down this ,
Signior Fabian , stay you by this gentleman till my return .
I will assume thy part in some disguise And tell fair Hero I am Claudio , And in her bosom I'll unclasp my heart And take her hearing prisoner with the force And strong encounter of my amorous tale .
By my troth , well met .
No .
We must die , Messala .
An evil soul producing holy witness Is like a villain with a smiling cheek , A goodly apple rotten at the heart .
Didst thou dream , Lucius , that thou so criedst out ?
Have patience and endure .
Where be these bloody thieves ?
That he might not beteem the winds of heaven Visit her face too roughly. , Heaven and earth , Must I remember ?
Duke Frederick , hearing how that every day Men of great worth resorted to this forest , Addressed a mighty power , which were on foot In his own conduct , purposely to take His brother here and put him to the sword .
Which is one ?
Master Fer .
And when you do them , Cassius , be content .
You are he , you are he .
What a blunt fellow is this grown to be !
I pray you , pardon me .
I have seen thee fight When I have envied thy behavior .
But I , who never knew how to entreat , Nor never needed that I should entreat , Am starved for meat , giddy for lack of sleep , With oaths kept waking and with brawling fed .
That's not an office for a friend , my lord .
That handkerchief Which I so loved and gave thee , thou gav'st To Cassio .
Dromio , nor thou ?
Will you withdraw ?
He thinks he still is at his instrument .
I have no will to wander forth of doors , Yet something leads me forth .
My money is almost spent , I have been tonight exceedingly well cudgeled , and I think the issue will be I shall have so much experience for my pains .
Our separated fortune Shall keep us both the safer .
I ' th ' clout , i ' th ' clout .
Excellent , i ' faith , of the chameleon's dish .
Out upon her !
Here is more of us .
Sorrow breaks seasons and reposing hours , Makes the night morning , and the noontide night .
But this most foul , strange and unnatural .
Go and tell them so .
Farewell till then .
Have by some surgeon , Shylock , on your charge , To stop his wounds lest he do bleed to death .
You mar our labor .
Oh , who hath done this deed ?
How do you , pretty lady ?
The jewels you have had from me to deliver Desdemona would half have corrupted a votaress .
Would it were day !
At once , good night .
Abhor it , fear it , do not enter it .
Even so .
How "seventh cause" ? , Good my lord , like this fellow .
Even when you please , since you will have it so .
Sir , his chests and treasure He has not with him .
Fie upon thee !
Nay , the man hath no wit that can not , from the rising of the lark to the lodging of the lamb , vary deserved praise on my palfrey .
Nor is he dead , for aught that I can tell .
Your son shall have my daughter with consent .
Let be .
I know his trumpet .
A man , as you are .
Good sentences , and well pronounced .
For you see , it is already in snuff .
What wouldst thou now ?
Banquo !
What , drawn , and talk of peace ?
Who wrongs him ?
Lucius , awake .
I should sin To think but nobly of my grandmother .
There my Lysander and myself shall meet .
He goes forth gallantly .
It was well done , and thou shalt sleep again .
What is 't thou canst demand ?
You are a lover .
I had rather be a dog and bay the moon Than such a Roman .
No .
Now do I see 'tis true .
Your brother , no , no brother , yet the son , Yet not the son , I will not call him son , Of him I was about to call his father Hath heard your praises , and this night he means To burn the lodging where you use to lie , And you within it .
I do not know , my lord , what I should think .
For one thing she did They would not take her life .
So good night unto you all .
On Fortune's cap we are not the very button .
Look you , sir , such a one I was this present .
God be at your table .
My heart is ten times lighter than my looks .
Why should you fall into so deep an O ?
Why dost thou use me thus ?
Why , man , they did make love to this employment .
More will I do , Though all that I can do is nothing worth , Since that my penitence comes after all , Imploring pardon .
Or as 'twere perfumed by a fen .
Sweet Hero , now thy image doth appear In the rare semblance that I loved it first .
What is Pyramus ?
Pray you sit still .
Scurvy knave !
One of them showed me a ring that he had of your daughter for a monkey .
Thou 'rt kind .
Good madam , keep yourself within yourself .
Say then my peace is made .
It makes me mad .
If I find a hole in his coat , I will tell him my mind .
God quit you in His mercy .
I tell thee , churlish priest , A ministering angel shall my sister be When thou liest howling .
Eros , Wouldst thou be windowed in great Rome and see Thy master thus with pleached arms , bending down His corrigible neck , his face subdued To penetrative shame , whilst the wheeled seat Of fortunate Caesar , drawn before him , branded His baseness that ensued ?
But , Audrey , there is a youth here in the forest lays claim to you .
You are welcome .
If she be false , heaven mocked itself .
If thy speech be sooth , I care not if thou dost for me as much .
What I am and what I would are as secret as maidenhead .
I am the son of Marcus Cato , ho !
Obey thy parents , keep thy word's justice , swear not , commit not with man's sworn spouse , set not thy sweet heart on proud array .
Then go we in to know his embassy , Which I could with a ready guess declare Before the Frenchman speak a word of it .
I wonder at it .
Not all the dukes of waterish Burgundy Can buy this unprized precious maid of me. , Bid them farewell , Cordelia , though unkind .
My dear master , My captain , and my emperor , let me say , Before I strike this bloody stroke , farewell .
I'll run from thee and hide me in the brakes , And leave thee to the mercy of wild beasts .
Be not disturbed with my infirmity .
Done to death by slanderous tongues Was the Hero that here lies .
To me , sir ?
Happier than this , She is not bred so dull but she can learn .
You were the word of war .
I would the lightning had Burnt up those logs that you are enjoined to pile !
Bid him bring his pen and inkhorn to the jail .
By Cheshu , he is an ass , as in the world .
Basting .
Fourscore ducats !
I will not sleep , Hortensio , till I see her , And therefore let me be thus bold with you To give you over at this first encounter , Unless you will accompany me thither .
I shall never see my gold again .
O , they did urge it still unto the king .
What said he ?
With any strong or vehement importunity .
Fare you well .
For , as I am a soldier , A name that in my thoughts becomes me best , If I begin the batt'ry once again , I will not leave the half-achieved Harfleur Till in her ashes she lie buried .
Who comes here ?
But while I say one prayer !
Striving to better , oft we mar what's well .
A pleasing cordial , princely Buckingham , Is this thy vow unto my sickly heart .
If I can recover him and keep him tame , I will not take too much for him .
Now to that name my courage prove my title !
Some others search .
He was quick mettle when he went to school .
This house is little .
He hath the falling sickness .
I could tell you more news too .
I will not .
My bounty is as boundless as the sea , My love as deep .
I prithee , peace .
I will be more jealous of thee than a Barbary cock- pigeon over his hen , more clamorous than a parrot against rain , more newfangled than an ape , more giddy in my desires than a monkey .
An I do not , Come , let's see the event .
Thou liest .
Ingrateful fox , 'tis he .
A credulous father , and a brother noble , Whose nature is so far from doing harms That he suspects none , on whose foolish honesty My practices ride easy .
I think oxen and wainropes can not hale them together .
Since no man of aught he leaves knows , what is 't to leave betimes ?
Was ever man so weary ?
Set down your venerable burden , And let him feed .
Oh !
Madam !
I am a very foolish fond old man , Fourscore and upward , not an hour more nor less .
He passes some humors and careers .
Where runn'st thou so fast ?
These deeds must not be thought After these ways .
How now , Lorenzo ?
I am no traitor .
Ay , ay , the cords .
He has killed me , mother .
Methinks I see thee now , thou art so low As one dead in the bottom of a tomb .
To th ' church take the priest , clerk , and some sufficient honest witnesses .
If thou dost play with him at any game , Thou art sure to lose , and of that natural luck He beats thee 'gainst the odds .
A second Daniel ! , A Daniel , Jew !
Dromio , go bid the servants spread for dinner .
I have performed Your pleasure and my promise .
My lord , for aught I know .
Or else she could not have the wit to do this .
Will 't please your Mightiness to wash your hands ?
If you will not , come when you are next prepared for .
I am out of all other tune , methinks .
Will not the ladies be afeard of the lion ?
I must away this night toward Padua , And it is meet I presently set forth .
But 'tis gone .
And so am I for no woman .
He shall have merely justice and his bond .
No , my lord , not I. Alas , it is the baseness of thy fear That makes thee strangle thy propriety .
What dost thou mean ?
Your ladyship were best to have some guard about you if he come , for sure the man is tainted in 's wits .
Thy sister's sister .
Have done , have done .
We'll along ourselves , and meet them at Philippi .
I can no more .
Take up my mistress ' gown to his master's use !
So help me every spirit sanctified As I have spoken for you all my best And stood within the blank of his displeasure For my free speech .
But all the charms of love , Salt Cleopatra , soften thy wanned lip !
I am very comptible , even to the least sinister usage .
A sight most pitiful in the meanest wretch , Past speaking of in a king .
Swear priests and cowards and men cautelous , Old feeble carrions and such suffering souls That welcome wrongs .
Oh , treble woe Fall ten times treble on that cursed head , Whose wicked deed thy most ingenious sense Deprived thee of !
Why , that the Moor first gave to Desdemona , That which so often you did bid me steal .
Who's there ?
A brave vessel Who had , no doubt , some noble creature in her Dashed all to pieces .
My mistress showed me thee and thy dog and thy bush .
Is 't possible ?
My lord , Mark Antony , Hearing that you prepared for war , acquainted My grieved ear withal , whereon I begged His pardon for return .
A kind good night to all !
Not to be abed after midnight is to be up betimes , and Nay , my troth , I know not .
It would make a man mad as a buck to be so bought and sold .
When is the royal day ?
Alas , then she is drowned .
Prithee say true !
Thy wild acts denote The unreasonable fury of a beast .
Ha !
So .
Away , and let me die .
Not one to throw at a dog .
If that her breath will mist or stain the stone , Why then , she lives .
This pernicious slave , Forsooth , took on him as a conjurer , And , gazing in mine eyes , feeling my pulse ,
I see thy age and dangers make thee dote .
That she is worthy , I know .
To save her life , I'll say she is not so .
Some wine , ho !
So do I , my lord .
If the cat will after kind , So , be sure , will Rosalind .
Truly , madam , he holds Beelzebub at the staves ' end as well as a man in his case may do .
This is the penthouse under which Lorenzo Desired us to make stand .
I would I had been there .
Wilt thou know Th ' effect of what I wrote ?
Look to her , Moor , if thou hast eyes to see .
I know thou wilt say "ay , " And I will take thy word .
To horse , you gallant princes , straight to horse .
Behold where stands The usurper's cursed head .
Sans fable , she herself reviled you there .
How long hath this possession held the man ?
Come , gentlemen , let's go .
Believe me , no .
Come , bid me do anything for thee .
O thou weed , Who art so lovely fair and smell'st so sweet That the sense aches at thee , would thou hadst ne'er been born !
Alas the day !
Say what , is Horatio there ?
How wilt thou do for a father ?
That's my office .
I long to hear him call the drunkard "husband , " And how my men will stay themselves from laughter When they do homage to this simple peasant .
I will o'ertake thee , Cleopatra , and Weep for my pardon .
To make an account of her life to a clod of wayward marl ?
Let him do his spite .
These are counselors That feelingly persuade me what I am." Sweet are the uses of adversity , Which , like the toad , ugly and venomous , Wears yet a precious jewel in his head .
Shall I hear from you anon ?
Your mother .
Will you sup with me tonight , Casca ?
The duke of Exeter doth love thee well .
Tell the constable .
Do but go after And mark how he continues .
Are you yet determined Today to marry with my brother's daughter ?
Whip me such honest knaves .
They are then excused , my lord , when they see not what they do .
She's cold .
His discretion , I am sure , can not carry his valor , for the goose carries not the fox .
The hurt can not be much .
In the most high and palmy state of Rome , A little ere the mightiest Julius fell , The graves stood tenantless and the sheeted dead Did squeak and gibber in the Roman streets As stars with trains of fire and dews of blood , Disasters in the sun , and the moist star Upon whose influence Neptune's empire stands Was sick almost to doomsday with eclipse .
So .
Hang him instantly .
I was too young that time to value her , But now I know her .
That's as much as to say they are fools that marry .
Full many a lady I have eyed with best regard and many a time
Hear the shrill whistle , which doth order give To sounds confused .
The images of revolt and flying off .
Have I in conquest stretched mine arm so far To be afraid to tell graybeards the truth ?
I must and will have Katherine to my wife .
Why , thou hast put him in such a dream that when the image of it leaves him he must run mad .
I will give treason his payment into plows , I warrant you .
As I discern , It burneth in the Capels ' monument .
What of that ?
Yet hear me speak .
Your plainness and your shortness please me well .
For he partly begs To be desired to give .
Signior Leonato , let the friar advise you .
Hie you , Messala , And I will seek for Pindarus the while .
Ha !
A noble duke , in nature As in name .
Give me my robe , for I will go .
Fair daylight ?
Pray , write down , "Borachio." , Yours , sirrah ?
The phrase would be more germane to the matter if we could carry cannon by our sides .
Travelers ne'er did lie , Though fools at home condemn 'em .
Farewell !
There's fire ready .
I'll have her , but I will not keep her long .
You rub the sore When you should bring the plaster .
I cry thee mercy , then , for I did think That thou hadst called me all these bitter names .
O , spare my guiltless wife and my poor children ! , Keeper , I prithee sit by me awhile .
Th ' affair cries haste And speed must answer it .
Well , you may fear too far .
Give him this deed , And let him sign it .
Kill the poys and the luggage !
We are friends .
And let my liver rather heat with wine Than my heart cool with mortifying groans .
O Caesar !
Come out o ' th ' storm .
I am tied to th ' stake , and I must stand the course .
But here comes Antony. , Welcome , Mark Antony .
All , all .
Sure ones , then .
Is it e'en so ?
That they were , I wish Myself were mudded in that oozy bed Where my son lies. , When did you lose your daughter ?
Thou art like one of those fellows that , when he enters the confines of a tavern , claps me his sword upon the table and says "God send me no need of thee ! " and , by the operation of the second cup , draws it on the drawer when indeed there is no need .
Tis true .
Now tell me how long you would have her after you have possessed her .
I crave the law , The penalty , and forfeit of my bond .
With bills on their necks : "Be it known unto all men by these presents." The eldest of the three wrestled with Charles , the duke's wrestler , which Charles in a moment threw him and broke three of his ribs , that there is little hope of life in him .
What is your pleasure ?
Three and three , We'll hold a feast in great solemnity .
Let their heads be slickly combed , their blue coats brushed , and their garters of an indifferent knit .
I think he would not wish himself anywhere but where he is .
Tom will throw his head at them. , Avaunt , you curs !
Haste thee for thy life .
If I can fasten but one cup upon him , With that which he hath drunk tonight already , He'll be as full of quarrel and offense As my young mistress ' dog .
The time is very short .
The gods best know , Oh never was there queen So mightily betrayed !
Can I bear that with patience , And not my husband's secrets ?
