What must be will be .
That's the next thing on the agenda .
Music !
We have in fact seen better days and been summoned to church by the ringing of the holy bell and sat at good men's feasts and cried tears of pity , therefore , sit down and take whatever will satisfy your needs .
It's true I'm not married , Caesar .
It's the wind .
You're a pustule , a sore , a tumor digesting my bloodline .
The present time is like a woman in labor , each minute giving birth to some piece of news .
Teach me how I should think and speak .
This is Illyria , lady .
Well , do whatever you think best .
Go ahead , I'll yield to your power .
We can not fight for love as men can .
What is she saying , my lord ?
Where have you sent the king ?
That will kill our lovers .
Or had a friend who would be a man for me !
Please , sir , have patience .
Was a man ever as dirty as me ?
If you pay too much attention to him you'll make him angry , and that will make his convulsions go on longer .
Two or three of us have seen strange things .
Then , hold my sword and turn your face away while I run on it .
Speak up and tell me !
Have you come to make confession to this father ?
Did my father hit one of my attendants for scolding his fool ?
I've got news , boys , the war's over !
Were you drunk when you seemed so hopeful before ?
Don't even think about refusing .
You heard her say it wasn't me .
Okay , I will , on Fridays and Saturdays , and the rest .
Oh , sir , someone would think I was a good fake .
I ask that again because nothing can be wrong if she is well .
Come on , niece , I'm sure you love him .
Oh , Charmian , I will never leave this tomb !
What kind of woman is she ?
I will .
No .
Since you're letting me leave , I'll hurry .
He's giving her a taste of her own medicine .
Only describing what you have ruined .
Are you the slave who , with your slanderous words , killed my innocent child ?
It's the best thing to do .
Be quiet and depart .
The whole world thought your father was an honorable man , but he was always my enemy .
I have to do it , I have to do it .
Then come to my house tomorrow morning , and since you couldn't be my son-in-law , be my nephew instead .
Ha !
You're coming here yourself to see the dreaded act you had tried to stop .
God forbid that I snatch the crown from him .
I meant a crowbar .
Go ahead .
Damn it , you're not listening to me !
Farewell , sir .
There is laughter in heaven When earthly affairs are put right And people unite .
Yes , my good lord .
Sister , I have a lot to say about things that concern us both .
Are you satisfied , Jew ?
Yes , yes .
He's talking with the bogus father about the bogus son .
I wish you had my bones , and I had your news .
I came here crying .
That's not good , and no good can come of it either .
Romeo has been banished." That news brings infinite death .
Who , Sir Andrew Aguecheek ?
What's the play called ?
Who did this to him ?
Can't you somehow use your dissatisfaction to your own advantage ?
Amen .
Is it possible ?
As you all know , overconfidence is man's greatest enemy .
Curse my father's ambition !
And go away , witch , go away .
A mature age .
You're sick , yet you sneak out of your warm bed and let the humid and disease-infested air make you sicker ?
You're going to die .
I wish I could believe you that all was well !
Only one man in ten thousand is good in this world .
This is as rude as it is strange .
As they pass by , grab Casca by the sleeve , and he'll tell you if anything important happened today , in his usual sour way .
I took your hands in friendship , but , indeed , I was distracted when I looked down at Caesar .
Are you starting to challenge me ?
Now I've said it twice .
I'll be vain and proud , I'll read up on politics , I'll insult Sir Toby , I'll get rid of my lower-class friends , and I'll be the perfect man for her .
Now I'm Dromio and no longer attached to him .
It's too bad .
Tell my servants not to mention that we were gone .
I weep for Caesar in that he was good to me .
I guess not , for good reason , as you'll soon hear .
What , is today a holiday ?
Yes !
So , good-bye .
Can you feel your legs ?
You won't enjoy it much , I can tell you , the odds are so against this young man .
Let me wrap up your head , and it will feel okay in less than an hour .
Let me unbutton this .
You're whiter than snow on the black wings of a raven .
What ?
It's my duty , sir .
What villain , madam ?
We won't go today , or any day until it's clear that it shall be whatever time I say it is .
So you finally find me worthy of your attentions .
I'll do it , but I don't like it .
She's gone forever .
Listen !
Whatever else happens tonight , I hope the king escapes safely !
No , you entertain your suitors with mild and gentle conversation , quiet and pleasant .
And why are you noble , strong , and brave ?
Come on .
Didn't you talk to it ?
We thank your Honor .
Good night .
Oh , did he ?
That's good advice .
And I saw her do it .
I'm here , sir .
Enough !
No , I don't .
Call up the Master Constable Dogberry .
I didn't think I would ever fight Pompey .
Drown yourself ?
Was that him just now ?
There is no better one on earth .
Let me finish my curse .
Bloodshed will force you to .
My name is Hortensio , sir .
Do you know whom you're talking to ?
What's going on , Othello , darling ?
Don't stand there shocked .
Macduff is missing , and so is your noble son .
Turn the ship to the wind !
The larger part , the main body of cavalry , are coming with Cassius .
Welcome back to Denmark , my lord .
I'm dying to see the prince .
What's your name , friend ?
You must have figured out who I am .
Let's not stay here with them .
Indeed I did , my lord .
I might wake you up in a while to send you on an errand to my brother Cassius .
No , I'll walk right next to you , side by side .
The will !
Does everyone kill what they don't love ?
Our shipwreck has made more women widows in Milan and Naples than there are survivors to comfort them .
The Moor's mind has already become infected with my poisonous suggestions .
I want to stay more than I want to go .
Look , here he comes .
Don't reply .
Give me your hand .
Thank you , sir .
No , cousin , I'm going to Fife .
Thus , I'll leave without being kissed .
I've never heard of that .
But we'll obey .
I wish you all the best .
What would I do besides good ?
Let them last forever .
I work for Titania , the Fairy Queen , and organize fairy dances for her in the grass .
What did your song mean , lady ?
Run , run , my lord .
Then immediately call the rest of the watch together and thank God that you've gotten rid of such a criminal .
Oh , help !
I should have waited to tell you my news .
Dear sir , I pity the lady and wish , more for her sake than my own , that I was more able to help her .
Mend" me , you impertinent fellow ?
If so , you'd be buying them to sell again .
When will we get to the top of that cliff ?
If you remember your life before you came here , you may also remember how you got here .
If that were true , then I'd know your secret .
For it is written in the book of Numbers : "When the man dies , let the inheritance descend unto the daughter." Gracious lord , claim what is yours .
It's all stopped .
Yes , madam .
You know that I gave it to you a half hour ago .
Hmmph !
Sir , do you recognize this glove ?
Madam , if I do as well as I think I'm going to do in these dangerous , violent wars , you and your relatives will have more good at my hands than you've ever had bad !
And welcome , welcome !
Tomorrow's a good day .
Where is the number of our English dead ?
Why "puppet" ? , Oh , I see where this is going .
Go get me a crow .
I've already had a glass of wine tonight , watered down , but look how drunk I am .
No , some of it is about my child's father .
It's women crying , my good lord .
Well , not in deed , madam , since I can't do anything unchaste .
But I could see that Cupid's fiery arrow was put out by watery , virginal moonbeams , so the royal virgin continued her virginal thoughts without being interrupted by thoughts of love .
Greetings , my lady , and may God always be with you .
I'm going to laugh myself to death over this silly monster .
Come on , Nerissa , I have many things to do that you don't even know about yet .
If I gave them all I own , I'd have two fool's caps for myself .
Divide each man into a thousand , and there you will have an imaginary army .
Caesar .
Who gets up from a meal with the same appetite he had when he sat down ?
Women are made for
I'll go for a short walk to calm down my feverish mind .
Sir , please , don't be angry .
All right , stop this .
Know that I am Brutus !
Listen to me , Beatrice , Talking with a man outside her bedroom window !
Didn't you hear her , guys ?
Cicero too ?
If he loves Caesar , then he can only hurt himself , by grieving and dying for Caesar .
What does he say about Brutus ?
And love doesn't have good judgment either , Cupid , has wings and no eyes , so he's bound to be reckless and hasty .
Let me love him because he deserves it , and you can love him because I do .
Since the light of my life has gone out , I'll stop here .
You always know he's got some plan that pleases him when he says good morning with such gusto .
I was so crazy myself that I forgot all about him .
Please tell me seriously what you think of her .
Good to see you , Corporal Nym .
Goodbye , goodbye .
Report back to him fast and tell him what has happened .
You can see for yourself .
Lead the way .
Oh , yes , we could , sir .
I was not myself , as a result of the wine .
Do your best .
Well then , Margaret , Ursula , and my cousin have been very much deceived , for they swore you did .
As for the rest of the ships , I scattered them , and they've gathered again in the Mediterranean , sailing sadly home to Naples , believing that they witnessed the shipwreck and death of their great king .
I'll see you on the guards ' platform between eleven and twelve tonight .
What if your husband strays elsewhere ?
Indeed , his mocking spirit has now crawled into a Truly , it all adds up to a serious story for Benedick .
I'm telling you , your husband .
In these less dainty times , you're not breaking the laws of sanctuary to seize him .
A lively young one !
Oh , a thousand times worse , a thousand times , and what a sweet personality she has !
If you cut both their throats , then you are the absolute best .
Why should I stay , In this vile world ?
Unleash the dogs in the western valley .
It's not true because she separates us .
Write to him from me , I'll sign it , sending greetings and gentle good-byes .
And when I get my reward , I'll get out of here .
You should know that to me , profit isn't more important than honor , but the other way around .
I'll write out a detailed inventory of my beauty and label every part .
Your fate awaits you .
But goodbye .
Take revenge for his horrible murder , that crime against nature .
This means I've mistreated Edgar .
No , there it is again .
You dance and prance and lisp ; you call God's creations by pet names , and you excuse your sexpot ploys by pleading ignorance .
Was the Duke of Milan kicked out of Milan so his children could become kings of Naples ?
We've got some words of wisdom to mull over .
Oh , please be true , please let it be that this man has mistaken me for you , my dear brother !
Here comes your father .
Come on , let's get to the banquet .
Hold him in custody until the Prince gets here .
Who can say I'm evil when my advice is so good ?
Oh , make them joyful !
If your Grace would kindly appoint some members of your council to sit with me once more and go over them more carefully , I will give my answer and acceptance right away .
What you just said may perhaps be true .
We'll be your witnesses .
Why , what symptoms of love does she exhibit ?
Oh , Cassius , Brutus gave the orders too soon .
What kind of man is he ?
When this wood burns , it'll weep for making you tired .
Why are you acting so brazen toward my lady ?
I'm not like that now .
Then why did you have to stick it in your pocket in such a hurry ?
Lock the doors , my lord .
Yes indeed .
My father's ghost , armed !
This is Antonio , my dearest friend .
Use your clubs and spears !
Let me choose now .
He had one yesterday .
There's money in it for you .
Be kind and polite to this gentleman .
Nathaniel's coat was being fixed , sir .
We have no friends but determination and the quickest death .
Don't damn yourself .
Speak .
Your children will be kings .
Let go of his arm .
I'm the one who fathered those bloodsucking daughters .
I'll watch this play .
After a little while , I'll beat him too .
Why , sir , must he ?
I don't know what you mean , madam .
I give you my obedience and my humble service , madam .
But Hello , my lord , how have you been doing lately ?
And I hope he's studying his music like he's supposed to .
Don't look so sour .
Fire !
Then your lips will feel them more quickly .
You'll have wine enough , my lord , soon .
And don't we have passions , and a taste for fun , and weaknesses , just like men ?
The gentleman insists on fighting a round with you , for the sake of his honor .
I have to make do .
No , my lord , unless I could have another husband for the work week .
My lord ?
As a matter of fact , if the playwright had played Pyramus and hanged himself with Thisbe's belt , it would have been a very good tragedy .
How unbelievable !
Your wife and brother led troops against me , claiming to be fighting in your name .
I'll beat him until the welts look like basket-weave !
There , Diomedes , there .
What do kings have that private men do not , besides the pomp of their position ?
Tell her to come here .
You're Pull out your tool now .
A nice stool .
My Cesario ?
Just as Antony loves .
I've never been taught how to make anything .
Listen , hussy , is this man one of your customers ?
My lord , I will give them all they deserve .
Isn't it possible to imagine that the noble ashes of Alexander the Great could end up plugging a hole in a barrel ?
He'd be quite a monster if his eyes were in his tail .
Give him your arm .
And I was just going to yours .
Do you see this sweet sight ?
Help me out of here .
Prove that the men you call your fathers did truly conceive you .
He sees himself in my two eyes , so there's two of him .
Count Claudio , when do you plan to go to church and be married ?
Now , let it work .
My husband ?
Abandon the person that has abandoned himself .
Do tell .
And here I am , with that piece .
The world's a liar .
I'd swear to you on my soul that she's a good , honest person , sir .
Small but brave in his surroundings , he's trying to stand up against the wind and rain blowing back and forth .
My lord , your noble subjects are looking for you all over the camp .
Fulvia ?
I wouldn't want a heart like hers even if you made me queen .
But gilded tombs contain worms .
I like it too .
Good noble ladies , be brave .
Farewell .
Goodbye , Edmund .
Your physical health matters more than your reputation .
So I recommend you take note of what I'm about to say .
Stay down , heart .
If you interrupt this monster with one more word , I'll beat you like a piece of salted fish .
Sweetheart , go on .
What we do we have been commanded to do .
Are you ashamed of me ?
But prepare yourself for some unpleasantness .
Is this servant of yours a smart man ?
He's not brave enough to be wise .
If you can't answer it , Go ahead !
I'm reminding your grace what you promised me .
Then tell me if Antonio can be called a brother .
How is she ?
You're on your deathbed .
The Dauphin , whom we asked for reinforcements , sends back the answer that he's not yet in a position to raise so great an army .
Please , and I'll pay you plenty for this , help me conceal my identity , and find me the right disguise so I can look the way I want .
Lady !
Whenever a king sighs , everyone groans .
Along with this strange power , he also has the gift of prophecy and various other abilities .
I love to argue with him when he's having one of these fits , because then he always has a lot to say .
That's the deal .
A simple country farmer who brought her figs .
My prayers , you hussy ?
I saw him once .
A man who's robbed , but doesn't miss what's stolen , isn't robbed at all .
Come , take away the Here comes Master Signior Leonato with the sexton .
What's the news ?
I've told cowards to turn their backs on me and run .
The king , sir , has bet that in a dozen rounds between you and Laertes , he won't beat you by more than three hits .
But quiet .
Have you both really given me up ?
Then both my grief and your sorrow will be cured .
Doesn't my wit suit me well ?
My lord ?
He'll do whatever Hastings does .
Have you forgotten her ?
It's strange that Regan and her husband left their house without sending back my messenger .
Absolutely .
Besides , they act as outward consciences and preachers to us all , a visible reminder that we should prepare ourselves for death .
Servant monster" ?
Are you making fun of me ?
Let's get out of here !
I'm sure Lorenzo isn't on their ship .
It's a bad time for such an injury .
I've often given money to people who were unable to pay back their loans to him .
Bless you , fair lady !
What do you think ?
Good old lord Gonzalo , " as you call him , is saddest of all , with tears running down his beard .
Should I go convince my daughter to marry you ?
Indeed , you have wronged me , you liar .
There's a lot to learn when a fool recites the words of a madman .
There is nothing distinctive , nothing remarkable left in the world .
Macbeth !
It is best to marry well and die young , better than to be married for a long time .
Well , I think it's good to be serious and keep quiet .
Mark Antony is at dinner in Egypt and won't be going outside to make war .
What's the matter ?
Tell her to come to me .
My friends told me as much , and I knew it , too .
May the evil one take me if I meant it like that !
Gentlemen , welcome to Elsinore .
Tomorrow , and tomorrow , and tomorrow .
No harm was done .
Murellus and Flavius have been punished for pulling scarves off statues of Caesar .
His nurse , grandmother .
I'll try to calm him down for you if I can .
Your father's sons would make excellent husbands , if only a girl could catch one for herself .
The world is not your friend , and neither is the law .
Richard , the duke of Gloucester , is very dangerous , and the queen's sons and brothers are haughty and proud , it would be better for this ailing country if they were subjects , not rulers .
There's no crab-apple here , so don't look sour .
Now I'll ask Cassio about Bianca , a prostitute who sells her body for food and clothes .
That's not good .
Follow me , madam. , Throw the blind traitor outside .
Do that , and I'll set you free in two days .
Great God of heaven , say amen to all this !
Laugh at the power of other men , because nobody born from a woman will ever harm Macbeth .
The saddle maker has it , sir , I didn't keep it .
Montjoy .
Isn't there any other rite you can perform ?
Excuse me ?
So get ready to cut off the flesh .
Here's the money you wanted , master .
Please , my lord , don't be friendly with her .
Don't refuse the love we offer you .
This letter's going to turn him into a starry-eyed idiot .
I swear by Jupiter I'll never revoke this punishment .
Will it be tonight at supper ?
You'll find Beatrice there , talking to Claudio and the Prince .
But wait a minute , please .
The town is besieged , and the trumpet calls us to the gap , and we talk and do nothing , by Christ .
In order to make your company even more enjoyable , I'm going to keep to myself until suppertime .
They have a massive army .
Since you know all this is true , why do you blame me for loving you ?
From our brother monarch , the king of England ?
I'll fetch him .
And , moreover , God saw Benedick when he was hid in the garden .
I sneeze on your manhood .
Oh , the world never saw a sweeter creature .
He'll tell them so .
Let those who will hear me speak stay .
And he told us to follow him to the temple .
No , sir , I live by the church .
If I ever come back , I'll bring you good news .
Because of your advice and your help , I have a high position now .
Our leader is being led .
He brushes his hat in the mornings .
Will you come with us ?
Sometimes I'll turn into fire !
You are all most welcome here ; please make yourselves at home .
Oh , there's my lady !
Lord Hamlet. , Please let him be all right !
Large and increasing .
Regret that your mouth betrayed your actions .
I'm not really Litio .
Oh , monster , we know secondhand clothes when we see them. , Take off that gown , Trinculo .
Beautiful ladies , please don't treat me badly .
When Caesar was alive , even he wouldn't dare anger me like this .
Madam , I'd rather sew my lips shut than tell a lie when my life depends upon it .
The cold wind blows through the hawthorn trees .
I met him in the street , he was there with that man .
I have received letters that say the same .
You come to me saying , "Shylock , we need money." You say that ! , even though you spat on my beard and kicked me like you'd kick a stray mutt out your front door .
Don't I have a reason to be angry , you disobedient hags ?
One of them contains my picture .
My lord , welcome this man .
Amen to that , Gonzalo .
Now I am no more than a woman , ruled by the same lowly passion as the maid who milks and does the humblest chores .
Good-bye , good-bye , good-bye .
Everything's fine now .
Farewell to you , and you , and you , Volumnius .
O Lord , I could stay here all night listening to such good advice .
I'm surprised I didn't bite back .
Fierce civil war will paralyze all of Italy .
Gentlemen , please try to sharpen his interest even more , and let this play do him some good .
Meet me at the synagogue .
Who measured the ground ?
Hello , sir .
So get ready to leave .
In that case , he's more obliged to you than I am .
Tell us , old Egeon : are you the man who once had a wife named Emilia , who gave birth to two fair sons ?
Where are my good fellows ?
I make her angry sometimes by saying that Paris is more handsome than you are .
Just tell me this : have you ever seen her holding a handkerchief with an embroidered strawberry pattern on it ?
Don't ask me what I know .
Well then , you must be in love .
What should I say to her ?
No .
Iras , I won't see you again for a long time .
Well , Syracusian , tell us-briefly-why you left your hometown and came to Ephesus .
When beggars die there are no comets in the sky .
We're men beached on the sand , hoping to be washed out by the next tide .
But , really , what's going on , Clarence ?
He's an admirable man .
Go ahead , rage till your proud heart breaks .
He is the general challenger .
Then Dobbin's tail must be growing backward .
How are you , Sir Toby Belch ?
An old Italian fox is never that generous , my boy .
No , Messala .
Good Metellus , go to him now .
No , please , speak seriously .
I don't feel like going .
What's his name ?
Let me gather my wits and get serious here .
Good Hermia , please don't act so bitter toward me .
He's in his chambers now , and he's extremely upset .
They wouldn't say anything ?
Who are you talking about ?
Edmund and I have talked , and it makes more sense for him to marry me than Goneril .
Some kinds of lowly activities are done for noble reasons .
I'm sure there was a herd of lions nearby .
Why , Fool ?
Why did you carry these daggers out of the room ?
I've only been hurt , not killed .
There isn't a nobler man than Antony in all of Rome .
Then , rejecting my request , you kill
So let me sleep next to you .
Aren't you dead yet ?
Here he comes , my lord .
Doesn't that sound like true love ?
That's enough for the senate .
What are you thinking ?
I did .
If this letter's right , you've got a lot to deal with .
I won't fail .
Do it , and shout like the city's on fire .
His attendants are desperate , violent men .
My soul is made out of lead , and it's so heavy it keeps me stuck on the ground so I can't move .
Oh , fine .
Goodbye .
But tell us , did you hear anything about Antonio's loss at sea ?
But if you conspired against my position while you were there , I might be interested in the reason for your stay in Egypt .
Forty thousand brothers , if you added all their love together , couldn't match mine .
He doesn't speak Latin , French , or Italian , and you know how little English I speak .
With a touch of green in it .
Oh , to hell with those people !
You'll be my witness that I've been forced , as Pompey was , to wager all of our freedoms on one battle .
If they have done this thing , my noble lord , If ?
Oh , stop , fool .
Sir , I think I have the right to speak , and speak I certainly will .
There were twenty Montagues fighting in this awful riot , and together those twenty could only kill one man .
I was not angry since I came to France until this instant .
How are you doing , Charles ?
Yes , if you want to help yourself .
I am the worst person alive , and I know it the best .
She only appears honorable from the outside .
You can't talk about something that you don't feel .
Why stay when love tells you to go ?
It's locked away in my memory , and you've got the key .
Long live Theseus , our famous and respected duke !
God have mercy , Grumio !
Oh , the things men dare to do !
Whom did he leave in charge here ?
Demetrius , I'm ready to fight you as promised .
It's dangerous to talk about it .
It's not safe to be straightforward and honest .
Juliet lies here , and her beauty fills this tomb with light .
They're retreating , sir , and our superiority indicates a clear victory .
Did this fool with the yellow face feast and celebrate in my house today while the guilty doors shut in my face and locked me out of my own house ?
Yes , my lord .
Oh no !
Send for him , dear uncle .
But tell me , Egeus .
I will see them .
But I am thankful that you have found it .
Sure I can , father .
Get some light !
And when she does , he'll imagine she's flirting with him .
Hunt them down .
So there's a rift between Othello and Cassio ?
They're just flattering me .
Please invite them in .
When I tell him he hates flatterers , he agrees , just at the moment when I'm flattering him the most .
Mantua .
God forbid !
I have no personal reason to strike at him , only the best interest of the people .
Dying , sleeping , that's all dying is , a sleep that ends all the heartache and shocks that life on earth gives us , that's an achievement to wish for .
Your wife , Fulvia , mustered her army first .
Meanwhile , I'll make a list of props that we'll need for the play .
When Roscius was an actor in ancient Rome , The actors have arrived , my lord .
I eat the air , like chameleons do .
No , not tonight .
And because I know how fond she is of music , playing her instruments , and poetry , I plan to hire live-in tutors for her .
This pantomime was probably a summary of the play .
Conrade , I say !
Pindarus , order our commanders to lead their charges a little ways away from this ground .
I've never known any woman or seen a woman's face , except my own in the mirror .
Give me your arm .
You'll work for me .
But to tell you the truth , reason and love have very little to do with each other these days .
Yes , every man forward .
This is the most miserable hour of all time !
Let me go , I say .
Am I not wise ?
I'm not moving an inch , pal .
If it turns out that she really is running around on me , I'll send her away , even though it'll break my heart .
I'll leave him alone .
They're saying I'd be an animal without a heart if I stayed home today out of fear .
Oh , please , tell us , sir .
Or tell me , my sweet love , what you'd like to eat .
If there are any , speak , for it is he whom I've offended .
But the critics and I found it to be an excellent play , with well-ordered scenes that were clever but not fancy .
I saw her buried in her family's tomb , and then I came here to tell you the news .
M" , Malvolio .
I'll be thrilled .
I'll pretend to be the housewife for once .
Ha !
There's a cliff there that leans precariously over the deep sea .
Not tonight , today .
Don't give up yet .
That's what we're trying to say , sir .
What's this ?
What , are you mocking me to my face ?
Romeo , are you going to your father's for lunch ?
He's a conspirator .
Look how flushed the actor is , with tears in his eyes .
The gods do this to test my bravery .
I won't be satisfied until I get even with him , wife for wife .
How did we manage to get ashore ?
Take my sword .
Don't worry about the cost .
I'm locked in one of them .
You should know this : much luck is on my side , and my enemies have happened to wreck their ship on this island .
Good .
I can put him in the right mood , and I'll bring him to the Capitol .
Why , what's Tybalt's story ?
Also , he's left you all his walkways , in his private gardens and newly planted orchards , on this side of the Tiber River .
Off with his son George's head !
Young man , excuse me , how do I get to the Jew's ?
Yes , we talked for a couple of hours .
I swear by my sword , which killed the Shah of Persia and a Persian prince and defeated the Sultan Suleiman three times , that I would face the meanest-looking warriors on earth .
The gods have ordained it to be like this , sir .
Have you heard anything to the contrary ?
One of our ships has reported that it saw most of their fleet shipwrecked .
The best news of all is that we've located our king and our men .
Well , God bless this marriage !
Then leave her , sir .
Well , go along now .
That's the end of the announcement .
Hide her for a while in your house , and tell everyone that she has , in fact , died .
You don't look well , Antonio .
But where have you been ?
Normally I would ask you what your name is first .
Open it and read it .
Do you hear me ?
But I'm still afraid .
As moral as me !
Curse the day !
What's the matter , dear ?
If we meet Macbeth's army tonight , let us be beaten if we can not fight .
Take a tip from me , then .
The king's in bed .
Oh , then you never loved as wholeheartedly as me .
Oh my Christian ducats !
But I'm afraid we'll never get him to agree to be king .
Has he taken care of the music ?
How old are you ?
I'm Christopher Sly .
Add details of your own to back up what I'm saying .
It makes me very happy to hear he's so interested .
Have them come in front of the master constable .
Let's pray that we never come into conflict like that again .
When I tried desperately to question them further , they vanished into thin air .
Here .
Cassius , what a night this is !
Yes , but these English are seriously short of beef .
Welcome , gentlemen .
I'm coming , my lord .
Amen .
Not the one I gave you , I hope .
I think so too .
What do you mean by that ?
So please rest .
And here he is .
Relent ?
No words can express the pain .
I also heard that your daughter spent eighty ducats in Genoa one night .
We are fortunate in the change .
And I see her also through the eyes of love .
Until then , we've said enough .
Blow the trumpet !
I'm asking you to understand my point of view .
Just tell me what to do , and I'll do it .
Nothing but "little" and "short" ! , Why are you letting her insult me like this ?
If you enjoy looking at your awful deeds , take a look at this noteworthy example of your butcheries .
What a wise judge !
The women you rape are the ones who'll have to "sense" it .
Let's follow him .
Those cowardly , gigantic sides of beef have been responsible for many of your family members getting eaten as a condiment on beef .
Now , if you occupy some place in the list of men that isn't down at the very bottom , tell me .
But in spite of all this , the man is still wealthy enough .
Like a fire that gets covered up , Benedick should smother his love and waste away .
You are a remarkable person and your loss is equally remarkable .
Will our army cut a swath through the fighting force of France , achieving and accomplishing everything I've assembled them to do ?
Be a careful mother , madam , and think about your son , the young prince .
Don't speak of this again .
Ugh !
No , gentle madam .
Awaken the memory of those valiant ancestors and with your own powerful arm make their deeds live again .
Young Fortinbras , returning in triumph from Poland , is firing his guns to greet the English ambassadors .
Thank you for all your efforts .
Love ?
Come , let's go to the dance .
Soldier , you must come to the king .
Look , here comes just the man we were looking for .
Are you down in the dumps ?
Who put my servant in the stocks ?
God forbid he wants to challenge me !
If there were anything inside their heads , they could never wear such heavy helmets .
You're a smart guy .
How are you ?
Good-bye .
Take it to your master and bring him home immediately .
Go out and feel what the impoverished feel .
Name one .
But I'm overjoyed !
Yes , it's well built , and the ship's pilot is very expert and experienced .
They're such oversexed gluttons that I feel like we're living in a pub or a whorehouse rather than a respectable palace .
No , nor could the devil's name be more frightening .
But come on , let's see you do your dance .
You , Prince , are the man who can give me justice .
Every month he has a new best friend .
Thank you .
Oh , she's slow !
He had a thousand noses and twisted horns , like wave crests in a storm at sea .
How many people are cowards at heart but wear beards like Hercules or Mars , the god of war ?
To bed , to bed !
I'm coming , slut !
This , this All-Souls ' day , is my just desserts .
What's the matter ?
I will go lose myself , wandering up and down throughout the city .
Nothing , sir , except grandchildren .
Oh , he's a dangerously clever boy , bold , quick-witted , capable .
But I agree , sir , that we were locked out .
And , when I do marry , I swear , it will be Romeo , whom you know I hate , rather than Paris .
No one ever gave a prayer like that before going to sleep .
Well sir , good night .
Double , double toil and trouble , Fire burn , and cauldron bubble .
My cousin's a fool , and you are too .
Tie up the servant , for he is mad as well .
And you're not suited for any place except hell .
I will , as surely as I am a gentleman .
Let's carry him to the barracks .
We're going to have an out-and-out brawl if I stay any longer .
You've connived to steal my daughter's heart , making her stubborn and harsh instead of obedient ( like she should be ) . , And , my gracious duke , if she won't agree to marry Demetrius right now , I ask you to let me exercise the right that all fathers have in Athens .
And if I , your poor devoted servant , may ask you for one small favor , you will guarantee my happiness forever .
The only thing different about me is my clothes .
With my music playing in the background , I'll lure fish .
I won't keep you very long .
The duke's trumpets .
Oh , really ?
I know the people of Venice well .
A guy like that is bigger than an ape , but the ape could be his doctor , it's so much smarter .
Nothing , Messala .
Now there can only be the promise .
I wish I could see this invisible drummer .
He's alive and victorious , and Mercutio's dead ?
You unwashed farmworker !
A love song , a love song .
Have you completely forgotten ?
And why does Lysander deny that he loves you , when he loves you so deeply ?
I will die and leave Death everything .
Life's better at
Ha , ha !
My lord of Gloucester , I have suffered your blunt upbraidings and your bitterness toward me for too long .
I'm not going to be bothered by you for long .
We're not invading England out of ambition or greed , but out of love , dear love ! , and my father's right to his kingdom .
Now , no more questions .
Tell me , my daughter Juliet , what is your attitude about getting married ?
Everyone , please leave us alone for a moment .
Well , if a moist palm isn't a clear sign of promiscuity , then I can't scratch my own ear .
My worthy Cawdor !
Tell me .
Lean forward .
Henry Lord Scroop of Masham , I arrest you for high treason .
For the enemy , see , and you can explain this to the duke , see , has dug its own tunnels four yards below ours .
May a hot southwest wind blow on you and cover you with blisters all over .
Alright , let's fight , boy !
Thanks for telling me .
Bring him to me in silence .
We're unprepared for this wedding celebration .
That's as good as proof that the sweet young man's in love .
Hail to your majesty .
They have a coin in England stamped with the figure of an angel , but that's just engraved on the surface .
She was only dead , my lord , as long as her slander lived .
Give him the goblet .
This bad weather isn't good to walk around in .
If you aren't immortal , watch those around you .
I won't stand for it .
Who are the new commissioners ?
That pale face of yours will frighten the others as well .
Farewell , kind lord .
She will wither and come to a bad end .
What about that ?
I'll stay in Messina until you're married , and then I'll go to Aragon .
Conquer , crush , conclude , and kill !
We follow in your orbit , and you have the power to move us .
Priest .
But I'll punish them thoroughly .
But , oh , it makes me bitter to look at happiness through another man's eyes .
Ring the alarm bell .
Come , come away .
I'll come with you .
He's dead .
Go !
Whatever your highness commands me to do , it is always my duty to do it .
Caesar's knave will bring him a message for us .
I never saw you before in my life .
I'll do my best to make this lady love you .
Give me my fishing rod .
If you want to read it , as I haven't heard it yet , though I've heard too much of Phoebe's cruelty .
You call it my " Don't you know ?
Yes , on his front .
There must be some mistake , sir .
Leave them alone , and do the murder first .
That she did .
Neighbors , hello .
Friends of this country .
Listen but don't speak to it .
But you had better get back to Egypt again .
That's very likely .
Please , tell Benedick about her feelings and see what he has to say .
Are those my tents on fire ?
If he's angry , there must be something seriously wrong .
Fine , thank you .
No .
The duke and senators of Venice greet you .
May you only give birth to male children , because your fearless spirit should create nothing that isn't masculine .
I swear he's the better dog .
Yes , my lord .
The Moor says the man you hurt is very important in Cyprus , and that under the circumstances he has no choice but to refuse to reinstate you .
He'll tell you more of the story .
In the meantime I'll tell you all , as honestly as I confess my sins to God , how I wooed this beautiful lady , and how she came to love me .
I think I'm getting delirious .
That's very sensible , but you missed my sense : I meant Hortensio is afraid of you .
I've always been straightforward with you , so now I'm telling you what I think .
I'd rather cut my tongue out of my mouth than say anything bad about Michael Cassio .
I can stand well enough , and I can speak just fine .
What does she say , madam interpreter ?
He is .
Now I say good night to your bones , Hero .
When I work it over with magic spells , the drop will produce magical spirits that will trick Macbeth with illusions .
It wasn't the journey itself , uncle , but the troubles we encountered that made it wearisome and dull .
Yes , even if I had a thousand more pounds than that , for I hear that you are Me , too .
Oh , uncle , it's better to smile and flatter indoors where it's dry than get soaked out here .
His wife probably did it on purpose because she knows what kind of fits he's having .
Do you remember a Venetian scholar and soldier who accompanied the marquess of Montferrat here once when your father was still alive ?
So all hail , Macbeth and Banquo !
I'm right behind you .
I saw Bassanio sail away , and Gratiano went with him .
Good night .
But where will we go ?
Gloucester , Gloucester , I want to speak with the Duke of Cornwall and his wife .
We're near his room now .
Can't a plain man live and do no harm to anyone without being taken advantage of by a bunch of slick , sneaky lowlifes ?
I tell you , Captain , if you look at a map of the world , I'll bet you will find , comparing Macedon and Monmouth , that the situations , see , are very similar .
No , don't cry , kind Eros .
If you're as good at pleading to them as I am at saying no to you , this will definitely come to a happy end .
I've left our luggage on the ship , and I bought the oil , balm , and liquor you wanted .
That's authority !
We must preserve our goodwill toward each other and not break into factions again .
Name him .
If he's in a good mood I'll mention you again , and do everything I can .
Oh Scotland , Scotland !
You're right .
Listen , because Tybalt was just killed , people might think that we don't care about his memory as our relative if we have too grand a party .
Let's have one , good soldier .
Come on , be a man .
My dearest sister !
I can swim like a duck , I swear .
But if your soles are worn out , I can mend you .
And he had a chain that once belonged to you hanging around his neck .
Pinch my nose ?
Where is that poor rash man ?
Then please tell me he's all right .
If you tell your lady I'm here to speak with her , and bring her out with you when you come back , you might make me more generous .
Let's say I didn't kill them .
He's not getting anything except the penalty .
Where was she born ?
Then certain ones .
Callow youth , you don't yet know how to love !
This is beyond weird .
I do not know that you are as good a man as myself .
I have a daughter named Katherina , sir .
Hortensio
Be good .
What is this news about ?
Go ahead , Moon .
I hope he's not anywhere so disreputable that thugs like you can find him .
All this excitement has made the time fly by .
She picks it up quick , doesn't she ?
Because I didn't want to watch while you gouged out his poor old eyes with your cruel fingernails , or while your vicious sister sank her fangs into his sacred flesh .
My master has instructed me to go to Saint Luke's to tell the priest to be ready in case you should show up with your better half .
What's her skin like ?
I'll tell you .
Orlando , my lord , the youngest son of Sir Rowland de Boys .
So what if I killed her husband and her father ?
Brother , you've made a mistake .
Ha , ha , ha !
I need to get away from you .
What did they do wrong ?
I hope to make the sender blush for it .
Then my children will probably be illegitimate .
where it takes on some other horrible form that drives you insane .
Do you really think so ?
I have important business that requires me to remain in disguise a while longer .
We've been looking for him everywhere .
Well , well , you have a careful father , child .
This hard work would be boring and nasty to me , but I'm working for a mistress who makes me enjoy my labor .
Don't say what you're thinking , and don't be too quick to act on what you think .
A sweet woman !
You scolded me often for loving Rosaline .
I've been hurt .
He's subhuman , like an animal .
Come , let's go .
I will be angry .
If I were your average fool , or if I made my feelings for you worthless by making the same promises of friendship to everybody , or if you'd seen me first flattering men , hugging them tightly , and later slandering them behind their backs , or if you hear that I drunkenly declare friendship at banquets with all the rabble , only then , of course , go ahead and assume I'm dangerous .
It's been proven that Lady Hero is innocent , that the Prince and Claudio have been utterly deceived , and that Don John , who has run away , is the source of all the trouble .
And let the wise man run away .
I'm telling you to make a fist and pound .
What part of the agreement did I break ?
I wouldn't have given it away for a whole jungle of monkeys .
If you can't remember the stupidest little thing love made you do , you haven't loved .
Who can prosecute me for it ?
Because , if you must know , she's been chosen by Signior Gremio .
The adventurous knight will wave around his sword and shield , the lover will be rewarded for his sighs , the crazy character can rant all he wants , the clown will make everybody laugh , and the lady character can say whatever's on her mind , or I'll stop the play .
No , after you .
While we're talking here , a royal battle could be won and lost .
I like it better than laughing .
Regan , I hope you didn't know anything about that. , Ah , who's this ?
You can speak to me .
With that , I hope God is with him !
I'll arrest him .
The island must be mild , and have a temperate climate .
Now I'll believe that unicorns exist , and that there's a tree in Arabia where the phoenix lives .
But you must not attract iron , because my heart is as true as steel .
That was excellent , really excellent .
Where's the gold I gave you ?
If it's the same one , If it's the same one , or any one that belongs to her , then together with the other evidence it's pretty strong .
I could cure you , if you just called me Rosalind and came by my cottage every day to woo me .
Tell me .
I'm so sorry .
I repeat , he's in love .
He's not the most polite man in the world , but , believe me , he's gentle as a lamb .
I pledged my love to you before you asked me to .
I thought the clouds were talking to me , the winds were singing to me , and the thunder , like an awful organ pipe , roared Prospero's name .
Young gentleman , you are too bold for your age .
For no man , sir .
Meanwhile , let's go to bed and dream about this .
Don't say that , my lord .
I swear that gown's for me .
You're this poor and wretched and still afraid to die ?
I'll kiss your hand , and with that I leave you .
What , you want them to weep our horses ' blood ?
But if I shake it up a little it'll work , because every one of those letters is in my name .
Oh , I wish I was the glove on that hand so that I could touch that cheek .
I'd do it myself , but I can't leave my post .
Killing him once is not enough revenge .
Dolabella , I will always be in debt to you .
Antony , it's time to stop your wild hedonism .
If you say my wife is beautiful , eats well , loves good company , speaks freely , sings , plays music , and dances well , you're not making me jealous .
Do you have any doubts , Antonio ?
I do .
Why do you hide these things ?
I'll do that .
As long as you aren't ashamed to show it , he won't be ashamed to tell you what it means .
What did you say ?
His cowardly lips turned white , and the same eye whose gaze terrifies the world lost its gleam .
I am nothing but a poor , used fool .
Chat her up , Sir Andrew .
I'll follow you .
I have a pretty good ear for music .
I'll put it on anyway .
I hope to God I'm wrong about your chances .
It's like a cannon .
The servants Macbeth killed .
She said she wished she hadn't heard it , but she also wished there was a man like me for her .
Then I salute you with this royal title : long live Richard , England's worthy king !
Its own color .
Let me speak my mind , and I'll rid the world of its sickness , if it will only tolerate my medicine .
Whip me , you devils , so I don't have to look at this heavenly sight !
Come down .
The beautiful Rosaline whom you love so much will be at Capulet's traditional feast , along with every beautiful woman in Verona .
Good night , Lord Brutus .
What you wanted is yours .
But if Antony is alive , healthy , friendly with Caesar , and not Caesar's prisoner , I'll shower you with gold and pearls .
And when a wise man gives you better advice than I just did , give me my advice back again .
His spirits are listening to me , but I can't help cursing him anyway .
Let's go to him .
Heaven help her ! , Get him out of here for now .
I won't speak to her .
Don't wake her .
Oh , liars can look so honest !
I'm sure everything will be fine .
Their messengers are ready , waiting to deliver our response in these matters .
Okay , now I'm dead .
I bet you're a happy fellow who doesn't care about anything .
With Cassio ?
Lazy people end up at the bottom , and you deserve to be at the top .
Alexander , God knows and you know , in his rages and his furies and his wraths and his angers and his moods and his displeasures and his indignations , and also being a little the worse for drink , killed his best friend Cleitus in a drunken rage , see .
Where is he ?
Go inside yourself .
If she gave you as much lip as she gives me , you'd be sick of her by now .
Tell me the truth .
Sad , my lady !
Let's go , we'll obey you .
On what grounds ?
Yes , and be brief .
It's not safe to go near them till we get more help .
But you'll see that the very thing that joins them will be the thing that separates them .
I've heard all about you women and your cosmetics too .
Go to him , madam , speak to him .
Is it fashionable now for neglected fathers to get so little pity ?
Did you talk with this woman ?
Certainly not !
Oh , he's crazy , Laertes !
It's dinnertime , my lord .
I am sick and sullen .
If it were nothing , you wouldn't need to hide it .
What work can you do ?
I am the youngest man by that name , because there is no one younger , or worse .
You shouldn't have to see the punishment we inflict on your father .
He's evaded love once or twice , and since then Cupid doesn't dare to shoot at him .
He said he did , I don't know .
Oh , I'm dying of hunger .
Carry your master out .
And mine say two hundred .
It's so simple !
She's full of good advice .
It would be easier to do it in the dark .
Please don't ruin any more of my poems by reading them so badly .
May good luck follow you !
I'll ask you another question .
You can be a eunuch , but I'll be mute .
Good to see you , Signior Hortensio .
He's got an answer for everything .
A big blast of wind shook our fortifications .
If I had as many sons as I have hairs on my head , I couldn't hope that any of them would die more honorably than he did .
They were lusting after each other .
It'll be lunchtime within an hour .
Am I that name , Iago ?
Silvius , tell this youth what it means to be in love .
Are you speaking from your heart ?
Our army shall somberly attend this funeral and then depart for Rome .
For heaven's sake , help me !
No , he just gets reality completely wrong .
This is a majestic and harmonious vision .
Why are you locking her away because of this fiend from hell , Signor Baptista ?
I hit hard when I'm angry .
Dear master , I can't go any farther .
Oh , no .
A woman should always pick an older man .
I think so .
Go to him from me .
The human being unburdened by the trappings of civilization is no more than a poor , naked , two-legged animal like you .
Murder has no tongue , but miraculously it still finds a way to speak .
Oh , I know .
ate at home , but the jeweler says he didn't .
How are you , my royal lord ?
For God's sake , find a house to duck into .
Heaven wanted Rosalind to have these gifts And me to live and die as her slave .
No , a flatterer wouldn't , even if the faults were as huge as Mount Olympus .
If it pleases your Majesty , let his neck pay the price , if there is any martial law in the world .
Why , he told me so himself , and he said he didn't care who knew it .
Do you know why the nose is in the middle of a person's face ?
But it has bay windows that are as transparent as stone walls , and the upper windows facing south-north are as clear as coal .
I'll be good , sir .
Come away with me .
What do you have to say for yourself ?
As it dissolves , so shall my life .
Good !
They were traitors .
almost read people's thoughts .
You told me that you don't salute at the court but kiss hands .
My lady Olivia's inside , sir .
I'll stop at every house .
Only God knows when we'll meet again .
Neither would I .
An honest tale succeeds best when it is told simply .
As surely as I am the queen of Egypt , Antony , you're blushing , which means you're Caesar's servant .
What a horrible world we live in !
My king , they haven't come back yet .
You seem a little depressed about this .
We're ruined , lady , we're ruined !
I'm always happy to hear about brave men .
I'm biting my thumb .
Who's that ?
I see you're all determined to gang up on me for a few laughs .
What are you saying , Cordelia ?
I'll write to my stepson Richmond on your behalf , so that he'll meet you on the way .
This guy here has banished two of his daughters and blessed the third one without intending to .
Really , my lord , I don't know what to make of it , but she loves him with such a passion that it's past all understanding .
Let's go .
Therefore , let every man give some thought to how this noble expedition may be undertaken .
I'll do anything you ask , monster , anything reasonable. , Come on , Trinculo , let's sing .
I was sent for a rope !
Can you do that ?
Come with me , and let's smother my fiendish son , who smothered your two sweet sons , in bitter words .
Your clothes aren't spattered with my family's blood , and you aren't affected by my curse .
Luck and Antony separate here and now .
The last time I was in Exeter , the mayor kindly showed me the castle there and called it " My lord !
They've switched their operation to the sea today .
Well , then , there !
Pindarus !
That's true , if the devil's judging her .
It's not in the contract .
crowned by the golden sun , observed his heroic son and smiled to see him mangle the work of nature , French youth whose fathers and God had nurtured for twenty years , since they were babies .
Stay in the dark .
I know they're in Rome together , hoping for Antony to return .
Stop her !
However your wit and luck allow .
Do you get what I'm saying , Reynaldo ?
Guard them carefully until we decide how to punish them .
Isn't that him ?
Please , don't speak to him .
The partygoers have arrived .
And aren't you a Montague ?
Please don't be offended that I don't want to offend you any more .
I swear I won't , sir .
Yes .
I don't know .
What news do you bring ?
All I wanted to tell you is that the lantern is the moon , I'm the man in the moon , this thornbush is my thornbush , and this dog is my dog .
A governor shines as brightly as a king until a king is near by , and the governor suddenly looks like a nobody .
Here comes Antony .
Dear Bassanio , my ships have all been wrecked .
And don't be proud .
He is , my lord .
No , that's the truth .
I wish you were what I wanted you to be !
Get me some ink , paper , and a candle .
That's not the tune I had in mind .
She's too much for me to handle .
It's some meteor coming out of the sun to light your way to Mantua .
Indeed , they say that the senators plan to establish Caesar as a king tomorrow , and he'll wear his crown at sea and on land everywhere except here in Italy .
To cut my penalty from that bankrupt man over there .
She took that ring from me .
Let it fly out .
The Queen will be treated fairly if she gives me up ?
I feel sorry for you .
Many men seek their fortune at seventeen ; at eighty , it's a bit late .
Sometimes I think I'm no smarter than average .
Please stay below deck , sir .
Orsino , this is the same Antonio who took the
You should be ashamed , generals !
That's me .
Are you indeed ?
My noble lord , What is it , Iago ?
Not with any sauce they could provide for them .
Don't you realize the duke has also banished me , his daughter ?
Clarence is still alive ; Edward is not only alive , he's king .
Gentlemen , let go of him .
You speak well .
You're taking it more seriously than I meant it .
No , not at all .
Will it ?
Get them in here , Nathaniel , Joseph , Nicholas , Philip , Walter , Sugarsop , and the rest .
This fake astonishment of yours is just like your other pranks .
What quality is that , my lord ?
I don't expect Caesar and Antony will have a very friendly reunion .
She's insistent .
I am the only daughter in my father's family , and all the brothers too , but I'm not completely sure about that .
Too bad it's spoiling our pleasure tonight .
If he stays in this country he'll be found .
Poor Harry of England !
The mercy that was alive in me a moment ago was smothered and killed by your own advice .
I've been so tortured since I lost track of you !
Young budding virgin , fair and pure and sweet , where are you off to ?
Go , tell the Prince .
Just listen carefully while I tell you the amazing thing I saw , with these gentlemen as witnesses .
You should listen to reason .
It's after six o'clock , my lord , when you said our work would be finished .
The war's over and the Turks are drowned .
If this business would really be finished when I did the deed , then it would be best to get it over with quickly .
I'll get my revenge before I leave this house .
By the light of heaven , no , I would not !
Your wife Octavia , with her self-effacing eyes and self-righteous assumptions , won't get any praise from patronizing me .
The life" ?
They left me and my servant there , tied together .
It is , it is .
He's a lord to a lord and a man to a man .
So this letter , which is so incredibly stupid and ignorant , isn't going to scare him at all .
That's the whore's curse , to seduce many men , but to be seduced by one .
I can't imagine what's made him so unlike himself , other than his father's death .
Cough them up .
God save the king !
What did he say when he regained consciousness ?
There's more knocking .
Come on , sir .
Stand up if you're really a man .
My God , I'm the highest-ranking person who speaks this language , if only we were back where it's spoken .
In a half an hour he'll be asleep .
We rejoice to see you , most worthy brother of England .
Your mistress's marks ?
My God , do you think I'm easier to manipulate than a pipe ?
He smiled and said , "The better for us." He's right , and that's how it is .
All right .
They are full of pity for Caesar .
The man who finds the sweetest rose Will be pricked by it , and by Rosalind .
You can't go any further with us , sir .
Good man , why are you crying ?
What's that ?
Take Beatrice , have you come because I called for you ?
And I see you survived your time in Egypt .
I know that voice .
Both you and the king might have ordered us to execute your command , instead of asking us so politely .
Go to Adriana , you scoundrel , and quickly .
Give me a kiss .
It's definitely Maria's handwriting .
I swear I'll smack you if you hit me again .
Maybe you will find a husband without a beard .
My voice is ragged .
A sculptor or a painter couldn't have screwed him up as bad as that , even as an apprentice .
I'm not .
Let's play .
Oh , evil , evil !
I am at your service .
I think you came to see my mother's wedding instead .
And they've been plotting things together .
Friends , Romans , countrymen , give me your attention .
What support did we have besides our father ?
I'll kill him !
Do promise , Kate , that you'll do your French part to bring forth such a boy ; and for my English half , take the word of a king and a bachelor .
If Cleopatra heard you , you would be well punished for your audacity .
Even the goddess of patience couldn't look at this and be patient , it's too horrifying !
The man who brought my answer to you was a fool .
Your death would prevent that .
You'd make a good fool .
They are , my lord .
That part of his reputation will stand .
Are you really going to tell me that ?
Are you making all this noise at this time of night because you have no manners , or because you're just stupid ?
Be a nice fool and help me find a candle and some paper .
But surely you're not planning to
It's a lot to ask of a maiden .
They've recorded my crimes , and I would rather die than have to retell this shameful story .
Trinculo , watch out .
Do you recognize this face ?
No , we'll sneak away at supper time , disguise ourselves with masks at my house , and come back in an hour .
As I came down ?
Look , here it is .
I swear to God I won't .
Why , wouldn't you ?
I could do a great job with Hercules , or any other part that requires ranting and raving .
No , please , I beg your Majesty .
I have an adventurous fairy who'll go seek out the squirrel's secret stash and get you some fresh nuts .
Is your master awake ?
Therefore , every soldier should do as any man who is sick in his bed would do : clear his conscience of any stain .
Well , the poor man died by your first order , which was carried by a winged messenger .
Should I tend your pigs and eat husks with them ?
I would choose to take my penalty .
I might come back soon .
Cambio is transformed into Lucentio .
Do you want to hear what she says ?
And I have met a gentleman who promises to help me find a good music tutor to instruct our lady love .
Anyone who has a house to cover his head has a good head on his shoulders .
It's a disgrace to us all .
How is it , my husband , oh , how is it , that you have become a stranger to yourself ?
I'm going to England .
Me neither .
And the ghost frowned just like the king did once when he attacked the Poles , traveling on the ice in sleds .
And as wise as a goose .
Can a man do it ?
Good luck .
What do you want from me , my good man ?
Put your hand on your heart and listen to my advice .
Oh painful sympathy !
Venus went home again , and her little son broke all his arrows , swearing he'll never shoot them again , but play with birds like other little boys .
And all my children ?
Would raise babies and clip coupons .
What's up , daughter and niece ?
I'm sure the duke will never allow this contract to be enforced .
It is not courteous , you know , to assume you know my meaning before I've finished talking .
Do you mean to say that the duke has abandoned the glamorous court to live as a monk ?
Babbling senselessly ?
Oh , no .
I'll be a harsh master to them .
Here is a friar who's trembling , sighing and weeping .
All we do is sit and sit and eat and eat .
I beg you to pay a visit right away to my son , who's changed too much .
Yes , but how he adores Mark Antony !
Is supper ready ?
My lord , I'll do it right away .
But those who understood him smiled at one another and shook their heads .
The harvest comes shortly after that .
The only thing I could do with her is to use all that oil as fuel in a lamp and then use that light to run away by .
Would you rather hear a love song or a song about the good life ?
I'll chop her into pieces .
Monstrous !
If she sends any letters to Richmond , you will be accountable to me for it .
And if they don't find charity there , they find it someplace else .
I'll have my lessons in the order and manner
Give it to me !
As I sat on the shore crying over my father's shipwreck , I heard the music creep over the wild waves , calming their fury and soothing my own grief with its sweet melodies .
Damn that crazy madman !
I'll tell everyone what you did , even if it
Look behind you , my lord .
We'll be married tomorrow .
Tell me what I want to know .
I accept with thanks , Enobarbus .
That will happen before sunset .
Oh , it's horrible , horrible , so horrible !
He is called Ensign Pistol .
My God , she can't be a Jew , she's too nice !
If the Turkish fleet isn't protected in some harbor , their men must all be drowned .
But we haven't made any preparations .
Yes , I think that's true .
For the same thing .
But who was that man ?
Ate at home ?
Was that the prologue or the inscription on some wedding ring ?
Lucius !
Would you like to be king of the entire world ?
Had the gods taken pity on us , I wouldn't be here calling them merciless .
No , he's an ordinary guy who 's got a gentleman for a son , since someone would have to be crazy to let his son become a gentleman before he's achieved that distinction himself .
I'll put the juice of this flower on Titania's eyes , and fill her with horrible delusions and desires .
I think I can do that .
Eat .
I'm involved in your rivalry .
How are you ?
More , more , please , more .
I'll never believe any of these old legends or fairy tales .
What , my dear lord ?
God bless the island of Cyprus and our noble general Othello !
But don't be easily won over .
And that's everything , Leonato. , Claudio , Benedick , my dear friend Leonato has invited you all to stay here at Messina .
Damn your mistress !
I swear , this fool has an excellent singing voice .
Are you lovebirds only starting to pair up now ?
Then I'll water all those precious herbs with my tears to make them grow .
The skin is good for your cracked head .
He's coming , ma'am .
How did he try to persuade you to love him ?
But what's the joke ?
So , I agree with noble Buckingham , only a few should go to meet the prince .
Bring me a bigger one .
The answer , my dear , is that they didn't dare , because the people of Milan loved me too much .
How strange I'm feeling !
Well , you're not on target there .
That's what her mother always tells me .
Oh no , good Cassio !
I'll have none of your money .
It's too bad their beauty fades right when it reaches perfection !
You want me to copy the embroidery pattern ?
Two or three men , my lord , who brought the message that Macduff has fled to England .
It doesn't get seen enough ; you should wear it in your cap , the way fools wear coxcombs .
No , indeed , my lord .
No , not like before .
Yes , but I am insulting myself by thinking this way .
What is this spirit that looks like the son of a king and wears a crown on his young head ?
Well then , the beef without the mustard .
Don't you have any manners , you savage ?
Help !
Then there would be two cousins lying sick in bed : one hurt by reasons and the other gone crazy without any .
Good-bye .
Stop advising me ; your words pass through my ears like water through a sieve .
We know each other's faces , but as for our thoughts , he doesn't know any more about my thinking than I do about yours or his , or you do about mine .
I always loved you .
I swear to you , You have a good heart , and believe me , I'll tell her that .
Come on .
It's almost four .
This strong poison's overpowering me .
And now he's gone .
By God !
No , I swear by my life and soul !
We're ruined !
Indeed , my child , at Saint Peter's Church early Thursday morning , the gallant , young , and noble gentleman Count Paris will happily make you a joyful bride .
Yes , sir , I'm here .
I swear the only ransom will be these bones of mine .
That's me you're talking about , the playful wanderer of the night .
Thanks for your trouble .
Bring him here dead or alive within the next year , or get out off my land .
The owl made noise all night .
I don't make fortunes ; I only see them .
What's your answer ?
Just listen a little more , and I'll bring you up to date about the present situation , which is the whole reason I'm telling you this story in the first place .
Oh , let me speak !
Every night I'm awakened by his Poor dear , goodbye .
I use it all the time , since it's all that I have .
Your English sorrows will make me smile in France .
Her eyes are vicious , but yours are comforting .
All right , sir , I will .
I've proved my trustworthiness by giving myself a voluntary wound here in my thigh .
But do you mean what you're saying ?
I'll fish for you and get you plenty of firewood .
She's the one who's got to do it .
There's no power in Venice that can change an established decree .
How can I marry him , this husband , before he comes to court me ?
Farewell .
In God's name , speak .
Anyway , how are you , Jessica ?
Is he standing or sitting ?
Write down "Master Gentleman Conrade." , Gentlemen , are you good Christians , and do you serve God ?
Mine , too .
Can you stay awake a bit longer and play a few tunes on your lute ?
Hang out ? " Who do you think we are , musicians in a band ?
Oh Lord , my spirits are tired !
I am .
I can tell by the way you waggle your head .
With this ring I give them all to you .
Your eyes look like they've sunk into your head .
He remembers how unkind he was to her , how he disowned her and sent her abroad , how he gave her rightful inheritance to her two dog-hearted sisters .
Am I to be dictated to , like a child ?
And what of all this ?
Enough .
I had to hurry to my love , beautiful Helena , who lights up the night better than all those fiery stars .
Away , get out of here .
Go , you old housewife , go .
On top of this , they've either burned or carried away everything that was in the king's tent .
Here , Fluellen , stick this in your cap .
I hope with all my heart she will !
You'll be my wife , dearest , and I'll serve you forever .
And , make no mistake , you'll find , as we his subjects have , an amazing difference between the king as a young man and the way he is now .
Watch Titinius and tell me what you see in the field .
The moral of this story is that it's not enough to speak ; you have to speak grammatically .
Good morning , neighbor Gremio .
I don't understand why she's not locked up .
You bastard workhorse drudge !
Yes , my lord .
Well .
Well , sir , and you , witty lady , who gave me quite a turn with your strange talk , my name is Vincentio , my hometown Pisa , and I am traveling to Padua to visit a son of mine whom I haven't seen in a long while .
A woman more beautiful than the one I love ?
This stormy night will turn us all into fools and madmen .
Maria , our lady wants you .
Where is he ?
They deserved to keep their heads more than some people who have managed to keep their positions .
I think you're right , sir .
Did you notice how the queen's guilty relatives turned pale when they heard about Clarence's death ?
Let him mount the pulpit .
Ambition shouldn't be so soft .
And like I am for no woman .
Did old Bellario send you here ?
I've said too much in telling you of it .
This fellow will out-talk us all .
He certainly flattered them both with extravagant compliments .
He's nearby , and Pindarus has come to salute you on behalf of his master .
Hear me , you wrangling pirates .
She says you're going to marry her .
Besides , there's no king , however pure his cause , who , if it comes to a trial by combat , can rely on using completely blameless soldiers .
After all , who would put up with all life's humiliations , the abuse from superiors , the insults of arrogant men , the pangs of unrequited love , the inefficiency of the legal system , the rudeness of people in office , and the mistreatment good people have to take from bad , when you could simply take out your knife and call it quits ?
It's best just to let him go .
You should go to Juliet and dress her up .
Curse my very heart , but I think you should be happy in this second marriage , because it's better than your first .
He can't be Fortune ; he's only Fortune's errand boy .
Oh , I'm talking too loud. , Where's Malvolio ?
Bad friends were .
Is this possible , my lord ?
I'll give my life for you , just to prove this guy wrong when he says I don't love you .
And
What does Romeo say ?
To none but you , only to you .
We'll talk more about this later. , Egeus , I'm overriding your wishes .
I hope you go senile soon , sir , so you can become a more foolish fool !
Dear Celia , I already look much happier than I feel , but you want me to look even happier ?
Here's mine .
I bet he slipped away and went home to bed .
Oh you damned villain !
Which of you two ate lunch with me today ?
Spread the word .
I hope he's in love .
Who are you ?
That's what he said .
Come on , you turtle !
The marshal of France , Monsieur la Far .
Everything except something to live on .
I'm watching the play .
Just as a town protected by a wall around it is worth more than a low-lying village , a married man's horned forehead is more honorable than a bachelor's bare forehead .
But I'll linger .
In return , I must clear the sea of pirates and send tributes of wheat to Rome .
For the love of God , be patient with him .
Sir , this is the truth : you and the rest , all the people who have ever talked about her , have all been wrong .
Is it possible that any crime could be so valuable ?
I can't remember how I cried then , but I'll cry all over again .
Don't make me do it , my lady .
I can't let my lips say his name ; "No man must know."
Faint , fall down , if you don't , then you're lying about my eyes being murderers .
Your answer is so strange !
Be honest and helpful , and I'll repay you for your efforts .
Their shadows are like a deadly canopy , under which our army lies , ready to die .
You annoying idiot , what Epidamnum ship is waiting for me ?
Is he dead ?
The hour of death is approaching .
Get out of here , you blathering peasant !
He deserves it , even if it were covered with jewels like holy
Good morning to my sovereign king and queen .
No , stop .
But maybe you don't like mine , or his , or hers either .
He won't catch a wink of sleep , either at night or during the day .
I long to be immortal .
Macbeth .
But what can be done to prevent it ?
What did he say ?
However , I'll do what I can for you .
Name them .
I'd rather be wooed by a snail .
There , take my fool's cap .
Don't let them know fear .
Macbeth will go there to learn his destiny .
Spoken like a gentleman .
You're bleeding a lot .
There's a husband there who's waiting to make you his wife .
Oh , hello , father !
In short , I'm not .
Each of you , give me your bloody hand .
He did , very sincerely .
The demon who seduced you could stride the world over with the proud gait of a lion , could return to hell and tell the devil's legions , "I will never win another soul as easily as I won that Englishman's." How you have poisoned my faith in people !
I believe it completely .
Ha , banishment ?
Listen , I'm going home tomorrow , Sir Toby .
Two of my brother's men , all tied up !
If you refuse , let an eternal curse fall on you .
Here it is .
My brother's love , the devil , and my own anger made me do it .
And let us swear to our resolution .
I wish I could be as certain of a good dinner .
I will , sir .
Why , good sir ?
That Lodovico is a good-looking man .
Absolutely , you idiot .
Before you got so angry , I never would have thought that .
But I will tell you that I seduced Margaret , the Lady Hero's waiting woman , tonight .
Traveling from Sardis , two mighty eagles fell on our front flag and perched there , eating from the hands of the soldiers who'd accompanied us to Philippi .
Friendship is enduring except when love is involved .
Be eloquent on my behalf .
Who delivered it ?
Dear master , listen to me .
This'll be a wonderful kingdom to live in , where they play music for free .
So the fool follows you .
What , does your wife say you can come home ?
We're all waiting for the revenge !
Here comes young Mr. Ganymede , my new mistress's brother .
Even though half of him is like a
No , I won't cry any more .
Richard Earl of Cambridge , I arrest you for high treason .
Thank you .
Well , aren't you a good man ?
Twenty-five , sir .
Shut up , fool !
Then she was even more an angel , and you're an even blacker devil !
Do you have your answer yet ?
Tell me .
It's a capital offense for anyone from Mantua to come to Padua .
My plans are almost at their climax .
I'll tell you what to do .
They say the horses ate each other .
Then do so , with all your heart .
The duke went with him to search Bassanio's ship .
Where is that messenger ?
The deal is closed .
They're just fine , my dear madam .
And so , my words and thoughts will be at odds .
First let me talk with this philosopher here. ,
where we quietly buried you , has opened up its heavy marble jaws to spit you out again .
I'm not feeling well , that's all .
What do you wish ?
If I live to see it , I'll never trust his word again .
Go in , and don't cry .
Ask this man's forgiveness , love him , and accept his offer .
No , sir .
Yes , pilgrim , they have lips that they're supposed to pray with .
Come on , you can go .
God bless you , Mr .
That's right , or drinking , swearing , fist-fighting , visiting prostitutes , that kind of thing .
And , gentle Puck , take this transformed ass's head off of the head of that Athenian man , so that when he wakes up at the same time as the rest of them do , they can all go back to Athens .
Oh , gods , make me worthy of this noble wife !
Oh , correct it completely .
Count how many times the clock chimes .
And maybe a third ?
Because he's so young , I've tried to discourage him , but he won't listen .
No , I haven't had lunch .
He intends to do something bad to you .
If you sit down , I'll carry your logs a while .
Let's go .
Come this way , my lord .
He saved me the trouble : here he comes .
To supper ?
Hurry , you slave !
I know you'd never skip school .
You're as pale as your nightgown !
Oh , I see .
Bow to him , fairies , and curtsy to him .
My countrymen , Silence !
There's not a strand of feather left in our whole army , a good sign , I hope , that we won't fly away like birds , and time on the field has made us slovenly .
Quiet !
I have to stay with the servants , who are with our camp's luggage .
Start without me .
You were a cold crumb on dead Julius Caesar's plate when I met you .
I'm going to make you look sharp , Laertes .
I've only done my duty .
Young man , something's wrong if you're getting out of bed this early .
Sadness is only appropriate for funerals .
My lord , your promise of the earldom , Richmond !
Some kind of fountain ?
But , uncle , you know how to bear with him .
But how will we keep it from being passed now , my lord ?
Don't you think so ?
And when some lowlife protests that Stop , and eat no more .
I'm hoping for better .
You'd better not make that suggestion , Agrippa .
I can read my own fortune in my misery .
You promised to tell me .
Well , it doesn't matter .
Here comes one of them now .
I know him .
Oh , no .
Think of your sins .
I see a voice !
How's everyone in Verona ?
But she , your subject , hates such a king .
Well , you've given away all your other rightful titles .
Doesn't it look like the king ?
Tennis balls , my liege .
Here's the water , right ?
Did you call , my lord ?
And when she is peevish and perverse , sullen , sour , and disobedient to his honest wishes , what is she but a loathsome , warlike rebel and an ungrateful traitor to her loving lord ?
God bless you and make you obedient , loving , and kind .
She disgusts me , the little hussy !
To celebrate a marriage of true love , and give a gift to the lovers .
They have me tied to a stake .
Otherwise , you'd see me blushing about the things you've heard me say tonight .
Go ahead if you want , but remember that crying doesn't suit a man .
And with another for tying the new shoes he made with old laces ?
If I can believe my eyes , this is a fine sight to see .
You shall advise me in everything having to do with Cleopatra .
Yes , it's William , sir .
of her father .
That's why the King of France listened to my pleas and tears .
Off !
All these new Christians will make the price of hogs go up .
Bring us some wine !
If I can tell him that you have submitted to him sweetly , he'll request your assistance in finding ways in which he can support you .
What fate is that ?
We've seen the best our age has to offer .
Only you would look for a fight like that .
Like love , my lord , before it learns to love .
True , noble prince .
You have wonderful armor , but give my horse his due .
Heaven help him !
Goodbye , old friend .
Opportunity's knocking for you , and in my imagination I see a crown dropping onto your head .
Well , I'll get my revenge .
What would you like ?
If I tremble then , you can call me a little girl .
Tell me your idea first .
Come on , take us to him .
What's wrong , cousin ?
No , master , I've been changed in both mind and body .
I wish you'd do what I ask !
Can a good thing hide itself ?
Indeed ?
Who pays their way ?
After you cast your magic spell on me last time , I sent you a ring .
To get used to the life you'll most likely be leading soon , get rid of your low-class trappings .
But I still have a little memory left , and there's still some fire in my eyes ; my dull , deaf ears can still hear a little .
Claudio ?
But there was a rumor , you know , people always gossip about royalty , that he was in love with the beautiful Olivia .
He said he would deny that he wrote his letter ?
Tell me .
If we didn't have rational minds to counterbalance our emotions and desires , our bodily urges would take over .
Some people kiss shadows .
tody of them so I can do what's best out of concern for their honor and the safety of the kingdom .
Goodbye , my lord .
O Phoebe , Phoebe , Phoebe !
What do you think of this plan ?
Can't Lord Stanley sleep ?
Poor poisonous fool , be angry and bite .
Good-bye for a while .
He was dressed like a hunter .
It may be , it certainly may be .
While we were here guarding you as you slept , we heard a loud roar that sounded like bulls , or lions .
We will watch the execution .
But how long will "ever" last ?
Go home !
Both of you are very welcome here .
Yes , that's me .
He's near death , and Roderigo's dead already .
Don't drive me crazy with curiosity , but tell me why your church-buried bones have burst out of their coffin , and why your tomb ,
Do you really mean to go after this wildcat ?
I'd rather be a weed in a hedge than a rose in my brother's garden .
You are welcome here .
There are no bushes or shrubs to protect me from the weather here .
Then you'll be able to cheer If he were dead , what would happen to me ?
Are we bothering you ?
A constant pain to me !
This storm has no pity for either wise men or fools .
Haven't you , boy ?
We're absolutely not here to delight you .
Don't say no .
Ah , I've got it !
Please forgive me as I forgive you , Hamlet .
I'll tell you , good Brutus .
My Lord of Warwick , a most corrupt treason , God be praised for it ! , has been discovered , as plain as any you'd hope to see on a summer's day .
And she can cry , sir , oh , how she can cry !
He's as
You , who are neither honest nor good .
I have made your daughter mine by marriage while false impressions blinded your eyes .
What's new with you ?
My dear Miss Chat-her-up , I look forward to getting to know you better .
I will , my lord .
Your master is a wise and honorable Roman .
Let me say "amen" quickly , before the devil comes in and stops my prayer , because here comes the devil , disguised as a Jew .
They eat us up hungrily , and when they're full , they vomit us up .
I'll tell you at a better time .
We'll have celebration feasts for each other before we go our separate ways .
Please forgive me if I'm mistaken , my lord , but I can't keep quiet when I think you're being insulted .
He is a noble prisoner !
C'mon , I might as well say the fool's the fool !
I saw it with my own eyes .
What's going on between you two ?
Don't stay here , go away .
Are you going to say good things about the man who killed your cousin ?
Did they make you the messenger ?
You !
Fake , I'm telling you .
You think my uncle was lying , grandmother ?
Yes , thoroughly .
Where is my lovely bride ?
Say goodbye to your sisters .
Damn my soul if these accusations are true !
No , you must see them as your father sees them .
My God , what a great song !
No one will listen to it .
There were enough Christians before , as many of them as could stand to live near each other .
The court has sent for us .
I feel better already , and I know there's more good advice where that came from .
I'm out of patience .
Ugly , wrinkled witch , what are you doing here ?
Is that how it's going to be ?
Kind Tyrrel , will your news make me happy ?
Give me some light !
Have them click their heels together and don't dare touch a hair of the master's horse's tail till they kiss their hands .
We have lost a major portion of the world through utter foolishness .
I'll stop your mouth with a kiss .
Why didn't I just adopt a beggar's child left at my doorstep , whose shame and dishonor I could have denied , not being its true father ?
Where is he now ?
Your guardian angel is noble , courageous , significant , and unmatched when Caesar's not around .
Fathers who wear rags Make their children neglect them .
Quiet !
What , I'm a prisoner ?
A likely story !
Sir , enter the castle .
Bad deeds will be revealed , no matter how people try to hide them .
I'm happy to say "amen" to that !
Who in the crowd is calling me ?
Play with me , Charmian .
Well , you have made a foolish choice .
We answered them , blow for blow .
A good fool .
What a tedious wait !
What's that ?
We'll have one heart , one bed , two bodies , and one faithful vow .
A good person who does something wrong is only patched up with sin .
Our regiments are full to the brim ; our cause is ready .
I'll take the Queen into my custody .
You good-for-nothing , let me in .
A nice message .
But you know , sirrah , we customarily say that the dead are well .
Down with the Capulets !
Calm down , gentle cousin .
And this is Metellus Cimber .
You must all keep up this united front .
He's been over there practicing how to act for the past half hour .
Now I'm in a great hurry , as I'm sure you can see .
Welcome .
I played Julius Caesar .
Oh , you're so lucky !
But as I said , the general isn't really in the mood to hear music now .
If not , leave me alone , and I'll stay away from your turf .
If you poison us , don't we die ?
Give me your hand .
Thursday is coming .
As freely , son , as God gave her to me .
Should we part , sweet girl ?
My dear Portia , if you knew who I gave the ring to , for whose sake I gave the ring to him , why I gave it to him , and how unwilling I was to leave it when he wouldn't accept anything but the ring , you wouldn't be so angry .
You make me want to agree with the philosopher Pythagoras that animal souls are reincarnated in human bodies .
The king and the prince are praying .
Your light dulls when he is near .
But since I've gotten myself involved this far , because I'm so stupidly honest and because I like you so much , I'll keep going .
You gave an excellent performance .
I'm not here .
Well then , tomorrow night , or Tuesday morning .
As for me , I'm surrendering all my power over to him , giving him absolute authority for the rest of his life .
I'll bet any man who knows the law five shillings to one on it .
I think he must have turned into an animal , because I can't find him anywhere looking like a man .
Look at the stars , see how the floor of heaven is inlaid with small disks of bright gold .
You'll have to leave tonight .
More and more light .
So give me your answer , and we'll shake on it .
I'm really worried about that .
I can't make up for everything that I'd like to , so accept such kindness as I can offer .
Well , it certainly wasn't true for Richard !
She was too good for me .
But who's with him ?
The Duke and any of my fellow senators will take this wrong as seriously as if it were their own .
Let them go .
A sword's too heavy for you to wear .
You'll do no such thing .
If she offers him her love , it's very possible that he'll scorn it , since , as we all know , he tends to be contemptuous .
Buck up , boy !
Are you insane , talking like this ?
But let it rain ; I'll survive .
What , are you moaning on about your toothache ?
Do so .
I could go around the world in forty minutes .
Oh , it's horrible , horrible .
Oh , you mighty gods !
If you happen to see Horatio and Marcellus , who are supposed to stand guard with me tonight , tell them to hurry .
I didn't tell you to get rid of one love and replace her with another .
You suffered a loss like mine ?
Isn't she a well-mannered young lady ?
There's only one hope for you , and even that's a kind of illegitimate hope .
I hope you're strong enough to do it .
The gods forbid !
There are lots of ways to get on the general's good side again .
I wish I were Sleep and Peace , so I could spend the night with you .
No .
My husband is dead .
Naked , " he says .
You're making fun of me .
What mistress do you have ?
Everything's fine , now , sweetheart .
The world has become so bad that now little wrens have settled where eagles used to roost .
Tell Antony that Brutus has been taken .
Yes , you're speaking very well .
Can I go away while my heart stays here ?
Yes , boy , I'm ready .
I'll have no halves .
Oh , Antony , you extravagantly generous man , how would you have rewarded me for serving you faithfully when you reward my badness with all of this gold !
So what do you say to my suit ?
Who put out the light ?
And don't lie .
Did you see him ?
I just saw him yesterday , " or "the other day , " or whenever it is , you know , "and there he was gambling , " or "there he was , totally wasted , or fighting with somebody about a tennis match , or going into a house of ill repute" , that means a whorehouse , you know , or whatever .
As you know , next Sunday my daughter Katherina is to be married .

Not in my house , Lucentio .
Let me tell
He's not here .
It's wrong for the duke to do this .
And as you know , his connections , if he put them to good use , might be enough to hurt us all .
Caesar is listening .
No man born from a woman will ever defeat you." So get out of here , disloyal thanes , and join the weak and decadent English !
There's nothing of the weak woman left in me .
Just like the rabbit , who lives where she is born .
The business you began here needs you as well , especially the business with Cleopatra , which only you can attend to .
She's as dead as the cold ground .
Farewell .
What , not a word ?
Time has come round , and I'll end where I began .
I'm an honest Puck , and I swear that if we're lucky enough not to get hissed at , we'll make it up to you soon .
Antipholus , you hear how the man pleads with me .
A friend .
That's true .
Be patient .
Now I'll tell you so you don't have to ask .
That's for sure .
In the mud .
The problem is in what the letter says , as far as I can tell .
I don't know whether he fought on Norway's side , or if he secretly aided the rebels , or if he fought with both of our enemies .
Uncle of Exeter , release the man who was arrested yesterday for railing against me .
By running fast .
I couldn't bear to obey all of your daughters ' harsh orders .
Me , a penny ?
Will you two help them get ready ?
And the greatest sorrow is mine too .
I'll answer for everything .
The size of my sorrow must be as great as its source .
No , no , they wouldn't .
Welcome to the open air again .
But he says he still loves and respects you , and based on his own feelings alone he's looking for an opportunity to safely take you back .
Give me comfort .
Whatever happens tonight , don't talk about it .
But as it stands , I wish I could believe it wasn't .
Find out the way , and I'll find the right man .
Among them are one hundred twenty-six princes and standard-bearing nobles .
We're two lions born on the same day in the same litter , and I'm the older and more terrible .
I don't trust you .
Then sing it .
I was born as free as Caesar .
If this is a dream , let me keep on sleeping !
I've heard her say that .
When a great leader dies he doesn't die alone but , like a whirlpool , draws others with him .
When I talked about all these things , Desdemona used to listen attentively .
Birnam Wood .
I'll back you up .
A man of great influence .
Your head is as full of fights as an egg is full of yolk , but your head has been beaten like scrambled eggs from so much fighting .
It's a common What ?
If you fight to protect your wives , your wives will welcome you home as conquerors .
There must be a strange explanation for this , if it's true .
From head to toe ?
That way we can conceal how many of us there are , and Macbeth's spies will give him inaccurate reports .
As it is God's will and pleasure , Captain , I entreat you to come quickly to the king .
And some have greatness thrust upon them." Heaven help you !
But come on , start .
This place is full of trouble , torments , and amazements .
I humbly thank you , sir .
Is it out of lust ?
Your master and his servant are here .
When I was still living with him I heard him swear to Tubal and Cush , his countrymen , that he'd rather have Antonio's flesh than twenty times the sum Antonio owed .
They're well too .
Until then , I'll walk around town , peruse the markets , and gaze upon the buildings , and then I'll return and sleep at the inn .
Do you need something ?
Oh my !
Greetings , dearest Caesar !
It's too much .
Is it possible ?
fast and pray to stave off temptations .
That duke who lives nearby is courting her .
He's slept a long time .
The other half goes to the state .
When all these extraordinary things happen at once , we shouldn't say , "These happenings can be explained rationally .
Dearest , kindest , most honorable sir , may I say , with your esteemed approval , which is lit up by the illuminating radiance of the sun-god Phoebus , that , What do you mean by that ?
I'll give you enough gold to pay back your debt twenty times over .
From that cabin I'd call out to my soul .
That's enough .
Your Highnesses can both attest to the fact that I've strived mightily , with all my wits and energy , to bring about this royal meeting between you two imperial Majesties .
It's time to reassess the situation .
Well , you can go now .
You know that the style of a man's jacket or hat or coat means nothing .
As for my wife , if only you had such a wife .
But let me try my luck on the boxes .
Let's go , because it's already after midnight , and we want him on our side before daylight .
Some people will laugh at anything , and others are so grouchy they won't even crack a smile when they hear something hysterically funny .
He told us to arrange it .
He acts like a man in love .
The glove which I have given him to wear may possibly win him a box on the ear .
I think you're an ass .
Neither rhyme nor reason can express how much I love her .
Come with me , boy .
Why didn't they just kill us that night ?
Or else their guardians and advisors said no , What hell , to have your love life determined by someone else !
Look at my face .
I'm happiest of all that I'm yours now , my lord , my king , and you can guide me as you wish .
I hope those lions stay far away from him .
Very near , my master .
Then run away .
Now get out of here .
My old brain is troubled .
You and I , Kate , we are the makers of custom , and the freedom that goes with our position silences all who would criticize , as I will silence you for upholding the prudish custom of your country in refusing me a kiss .
Nice Grumio , bring me some .
It won't go on .
Everyone who can hear has heard about it .
Our jailers will shrivel up with old age before they make us cry again .
I'm not interested in anything a eunuch can do .
Give me a torch .
A jumbled confession can only receive a jumbled absolution .
Your beautiful eyes , sweet lady , have infected mine with love .
He's without equal !
It's true !
How is my Juliet ?
Tell us , Othello .
I've been stripped of everything , betrayed .
The moon ?
What ?
Next time God sends out a shipment of hair , I hope he gives you a beard !
My lord , I wish Thursday were tomorrow .
My ear must pull it out .
Allow me to continue. , I am a gentleman of Verona , sir , who , hearing of your daughter's beauty and wit , her friendly disposition and bashful modesty , her uncommon virtues and her mild behavior , have taken the liberty of presenting myself as a guest at your house in the hope of seeing for myself if what I've heard is true .
Or if you've got some buried treasure somewhere , which they say often makes ghosts restless , then tell us about it .
Can you smell out his secret now ?
But they're siding with a better wrestler than myself .
Don't ask me anything .
Up to the breach , you dogs !
Three proper young men , all good looking and with great presence ,
I figure that once he's crippled me , I'll beg by showing off my beatings .
I say she shall. , And first begin with her .
I'm afraid my Thisbe has forgotten her promise ! , And you , oh Wall , oh sweet , oh lovely Wall , you stand between her father's property and mine , you Wall , oh Wall , oh sweet and lovely Wall .
I'm your love , no matter what you think .
Myself ?
Today's a holiday , so the beggar's shop is shut .
Goodbye , my Desdemona .
Signior Gremio , are you coming from the church ?
Thank you for his present and your trouble .
Can it be possible that no one saw them leave ?
Go ahead , you fool .
Three months from twelve months of the year .
No one admires speed more than the lazy .
That's true , that's very true .
Let me shake your hand .
And like I am for Ganymede .
I , sir , am Dromio .
I'm your advocate , and I'd rather die than give up on you .
What a tunneler !
Am I on earth , in heaven , or in hell ?
If we're all pork-eaters , we won't be able to get our hands on a slice of bacon , even if we've got the money for it .
Oh , what an excellent thing this learning is !
Soon we will toast around the table .
What , was I married to her in a dream ?
I'd give it all up , yes , I'd sacrifice them all to this devil here , to save you .
And also to find out the size of the enemy army .
Where did he get wine ?
There has never been so black a day as today .
Don't go near Casca .
I'm glad to see you in such a merry mood .
You're Forgive me , Signior Gremio , but I'm anxious to get things moving .
Don't tug on my clothes .
Let's go , Tom .
I hope to God he keeps his promise !
I'm not bringing any declarations of war or demands for cash .
I pity England , but not myself .
The change will be recorded as a precedent , and many bad legal decisions will result .
I knew your father .
I still have the smell of blood on my hand .
He's offered me a lot of affection lately .
Madam , what should I do ?
And then what would I do with him ?
I don't know .
Then he swore he was a stranger here .
But in the meantime , just assume that I'm paranoid , as I'm pretty sure I am , and keep thinking she's innocent , please .
I will , Caesar .
Didn't feel like it ?
I can't believe that .
But oops , when I let go of your hand , I let go of the biggest joke of all .
I'll send my eyes to prison , and they'll never be free to look at anything again .
Companions in sorrow alleviate our grief .
We have a little dessert coming up .
Come on , Antonio .
Statilius waved the torchlight at us , but he hasn't come back .
No , no , until it comes true we'll pretend it was just a dream we had .
At that time you can smash in his skull after seizing his books ; or you can bash his skull with a log ; or you can stab him in the belly ; or cut his windpipe .
Yes , why not , my lord ?
I took the hint and spoke to her .
Then lead the way , father .
Welcome , my friends .
Prepare your troops .
I hope not , Madam .
Is her voice pitched high or low ?
Tut , tut , my lord , we're not going to stand around chit-chatting .
Age hasn't dried up my body or eroded my intelligence so much , and luck hasn't robbed me of so much of my fortune , and my bad ways haven't deprived me of so many friends , that they won't find me ready to seek revenge both physically and mentally , with money and friends at my disposal .
Then please , put off your eating for a little while I , like a mother doe , find my fawn and bring it food .
But here's the plan : our army will stay with us on the hills by the city .
A mischievous child .
Upon my life , my lord , I'll do it .
My brother has a daughter who looks exactly like Hero ; this girl is heir to both our estates .
The king will already have left Southampton .
When you were wooing Desdemona , did Michael Cassio know about it ?
He's rushing on his way here right now , and Regan's with him .
There is nothing in the world that I love as much as you .
Speak , if you can .
The tyrant I'm serving now can go to hell !
Why are you so rude to someone who loves you so much ?
I'm afraid it will I'd love it .
It is only as high as it is and moves with its own legs .
Any villain in Denmark is going to be , well , a villain .
All right Ursula , as Beatrice arrives , we'll be walking up and down this alley and speaking about nothing but Benedick .
I'm as commanding as she is proud , and when two raging fires meet , they end up consuming the very thing that kindled them .
Picture the cabin boys climbing around the rigging .
You're a fool .
How many times will Caesar bleed again in show , though he now lies at the base of Pompey's statue , as worthless as dust !
Read it , great Caesar .
You said it when you were furious .
Let me play the lion too .
Is it that aggressive ?
Really , Audrey , I wish you were more poetical .
Word is that Richmond is the navy's admiral .
The duke of Gloucester , who has command over the siege , is in consultation with an Irishman , a very valiant gentleman indeed .
You didn't do anything else to earn this punishment ?
Madam , how are you liking this play ?
Such a wonderful father-in-law and wife make this place a paradise .
God bless you .
Divine , perfect woman , give me a chance to prove in detail that I'm innocent of the evils you accuse me of .
How many noblemen would be weeded out and would become peasants ?
No , I swear it .
I'd feel sorry for them , if I were human .
What's this part for ?
If you want to cry over my bad luck , I'll give you my eyes .
Don't bother trying to intimidate me by putting your hand on your sword .
Stanley dreamed the boar beheaded him , and I laughed and refused to flee with him .
That's the one .
No , I'm not wound up .
They're ready whenever you are .
I'm not dead ?
Listen , Dardanius .
Tell me so I can be sure , though I swear I recognize your voice .
And now you've changed ?
Oh Nerissa , my poor little body is tired of this great big world .
Poor Tom will take you there .
The Emperor is calling for Canidius .
He was wrong to do that .
Fabian , bring him here .
Grumio gave the order for how it should be done .
He begs you to spare his life .
This is the inventory of the money , silverware , dishes , and jewels that are still in my possession .
Well then , leave them alone until they're sober .
When things are at their worst they have to stop , or else improve to the way things were before .
This play isn't right for you .
Didn't you say something ?
And I too ?
And that's true too .
I'll get it from you , I swear .
Two of the brightest stars in the whole sky had to go away on business , and they're asking her eyes to twinkle in their places until they return .
Ah , but there is , Horatio , there's a lot of offense .
I don't know .
When an evil thing has been lost , no one cries .
And I'll help you .
I'll go on with my speech praising you , and then I'll get to the point .
You take the bill and I'll take your yardstick .
She's a good little woman , and she adores me .
Please don't ruin any more trees by carving love poems on their barks .
For that reason he sends you this good news , that this very day your enemies , the queen's relatives , will die at Pomfret .
Now he's a little crooked .
I sent you a letter while you were carousing in Alexandria .
I'll come at you with the old proverb : "Should I make myself at home ? "
Stand back .
Welcome , my good Alexas .
Well , let's watch it .
He speaks roughly , but what he says is smart , and his roughness makes other people enjoy listening to him .
Give us a smile .
I had no idea she was cheating on me .
Oh , I really think she loves me !
If you get what you want and you're still not happy , you've spent everything and gained nothing .
If it's possible to do this without putting yourself in danger , dear Captain Blunt , say goodnight to him from me and give him this important note .
Our hour is up .
I was with the heroes Hercules and Cadmus once , when their Spartan hunting dogs cornered a bear .
Before I could break up the fight , Tybalt was killed .
Draw your sword !
I don't care if you love me or not , I like the cap and I'll have it or I won't have any .
Thank God and my horoscope !
So-so" is good , very good , an excellent answer .
Why ?
Good-bye !
Alas , I am the mother of all these others ' griefs .
The sound of lovers calling each others names through the night is silver-sweet .
Here he comes .
Your stockings should be falling down around your ankles , your hat flying off your head , your sleeves unbuttoned , your shoes untied , and everything about you demonstrating carelessness and misery .
No problem , madam .
Have a good life .
And he's still warm , by God .
Oh , what a world this is , when even what is beautiful in a man poisons him !
It's too bad .
We'll take care of it .
Then it's no surprise they had a bad influence on him .
Now , sir , where is Claudio ?
But why aren't you in your shop today ?
Age is the thing that nourishes .
It's all the same .
Bassanio gave his ring to the judge who asked for it , and deserved it too .
In what sense , my lord ?
We charge you , in the Prince's name , to stop !
Are you really alive , Stephano ?
Maybe it's a parade to welcome us to town , master .
Take it easy !
We shouldn't expect men to be perfect , or for them to be as polite as on the weddingday .
Draw your trustworthy sword , which you have used in such service to your country .
And that necklace around his neck is the very one he swore he didn't have !
Talk to him .
Hide with a false pleasant face what you know in your false , evil heart .
This diamond is a present from him to your wife for her boundless hospitality .
You can have it then , your highness .
Follow that gentleman now , and be careful not to make fun of him .
Romeo is coming .
It eases the spirit .
You'd think everyone was asleep .
I mean knock his brains out , so he can't take Othello's place .
Here comes Oberon .
Agrippa , go start the battle .
But don't be afraid , Cesario .
Well , first there was the prince from Naples .
They shouted three times .
Invoke his warlike spirit and that of Edward the Black Prince , your great-uncle , who fought a tragic battle on French soil , routing the French army in full force while his mighty father stood by on a hilltop , smiling to see his son steeped in the blood of French noblemen .
Go , get out of here .
Now , Balthazar , you've always been honest and faithful to me , and I trust you still are .
Has Romeo been killed , and is Tybalt dead too ?
God willing , our love and our happiness will only increase as we get older .
Pull off my beard ?
Go look for him .
Oh , well , stay till then !
So we need another prologue to tell everyone he's not a real lion .
I found this pinned to my tent this morning .
I'm glad your father isn't alive to see this .
Speak , Pyramus. , Thisbe , come forward .
I think you're all either bewildered or stark raving mad .
We'll have another bear-baiting just to make him angry , and we'll mock him till he's black and blue .
I'm sending you to England on diplomatic business , and Hamlet will go with you .
Frightening looks are also at my service , as are fake smiles .
Please , sir , be quiet .
Go to him , Sir Topas .
It's time that we brought our armies into the field .
To work for you , sir .
Will it be in thunder , lightning , or rain ?
BASSANIO Please , Leonardo , think about this I'll do my best .
He has a father , and yet he is fatherless .
Hortensio , good friends like us can get by on a few words .
But if I were Brutus and Brutus were me , then I'd stir you up , and install in each of Caesar's wounds the kind of voice that could convince even stones to rise up and mutiny .
I hope he is , but mothers get to have their doubts .
Sweet Phoebe , do not scorn me .
I think I've found one already , thanks to you , my lord .
At my humble house tonight , you can expect to see dazzling stars that walk on the ground and light the sky from below .
So , in that case , tell me who's next in line to inherit the kingdom of Naples ?
You're a king's advisor .
Here they come .
My lord , if you have a free moment , I have a message from His Majesty .
Who wouldn't cheat on her husband to make him king ?
Who's there ?
I'll get you for that .
In the first act he is an infant , whimpering and puking in his nurse's arms .
But here come some people , right in the nick of time .
Dear gods in heaven , what's the reason for this ?
Not for a second .
You corrupt judge , why did you let her escape ?
He's the only worthy man in Italy , aside from my dear Claudio .
He who chooses me must give and risk all he has." Must give everything , for what ?
Here and now I seem like Antony , but I can't keep myself in this form , my boy .
Then we'll see that tomorrow night .
Tell me , please : how many boys and girls will I have ?
How did you lose your breath ?
No , I won't give my medicine away to anyone but the sick .
Oh , what a sad day !
Go ahead , then .
If you love me , let me know by smiling at me .
But you're a famous pirate !
You may come across better food , but not a warmer welcome .
Revise your statement , or you may damage your inheritance .
Alas , why would you heap all these responsibilities on me ?
Well , that doesn't worry me .
No !
I won't give up this child for all of Fairyland .
And now you toss flowers in the path of Caesar , who comes in triumph over Pompey's defeated sons ?
Do you know the difference , my boy , between a bitter fool and a sweet one ?
You'll grant me , you hedgehog ?
It was just moments ago .
So take for life a fellow of pure and plain faithfulness .
I just know I'm not one .
I was talking to a petitioner here just now , someone who's suffering from your anger .
Hurry .
Why the hell did you come in between us ?
This is a good agreement .
Though I wouldn't wish to be better for my own sake , for your sake I wish I were twenty times more than myself , a thousand times more beautiful and ten thousand times richer , just so you might value me more , so my good qualities , beauty , possessions , and friends would be more than you could calculate .
Then why did you travel so quietly ?
Captain Macmorris , if you take my words in some way other than how they were meant , see , I'll have to think you're not treating me with the good will you ought to , see , since I am as good a man as yourself , both in the practice of war and in my country of origin and in other respects .
I'm not who I appear to be .
We'll burn Brutus's house .
Your mistress sent for me to come to dinner ?
What's the news among the merchants ?
I never hurt you .
But , Lepidus , go to Caesar's house .
Oh , I've read that .
You piece of filth , you're lying !
Oh , that's a good wish !
Here is some money for you to kill me immediately .
You're alive .
Instead of Celia , call me Aliena .
Thank you kindly .
It's a miracle you're alive .
This was the most unkind cut of all .
Yes , it stinks very sweetly .
Show me the way .
It doesn't matter that I hit him first .
Yes , sir .
But I will go out , for these bad omens apply to the world in general as much as they do to me .
But you're still my child , my flesh and blood , or rather you're a disease in my flesh , a disease I still have to call my own .
Come on .
I'll go my own way .
What are you Nothing .
Pardon me ?
He's still sharp when it comes to carrying out a bold or noble enterprise , though he puts on this show of stupidity .
This is all quite pleasant .
Do you work in this house ?
Gratiano talks more nonsense than any other man in Venice .
Let us hear him .
Sir , your age and status inspire more respect than your weapons do .
What do the priests say ?
I wish you well .
In fact , I consider ambition to be so light and airy that it's only the shadow of a shadow .
My door is locked .
With who ?
Oh , blessed , blessed night !
Is it four o'clock ?
And even though you know I'm very close to the Prince and Claudio , I swear I'll keep your counsel and deal with this secretly and justly .
That's all .
Welcome , sir .
Yes , he does .
What do you think about him , Cassio ?
Oh , noble sir !
But I can't play a melody .
Well , enough about them. , Come here , Catesby .
Bridegroom ?
And in her eyes I see a fire that would seem to burn away the lies the princes have told about her chastity .
But not so nice when women misbehave .
Your son Edward , who stabbed my son Edward , is dead .
If you're Stephano , touch me and speak to me .
To our house .
You're mistaken .
Oh , in the duke of Gloucester's wallet .
What do you think , Bottom ?
What was the last cry for ?
Neither of them would take anything but the two rings .
I tell you I requested that your master cut out the gown , but I didn't ask him to cut it all to pieces .
You take your beauty sleep now .
Poison never came from such a sweet place .
Come , last of my friends , rest on this rock .
Wasn't that letter from Jessica ?
Come on .
Who can blame him for acting crazy , when inside he condemns himself for everything he's done ?
Shouldn't I say , "Does a dog have money ?
What , are you crazy ?
But , sir , here comes your servant .
Don't come again to ask for my ransom , good messenger .
Even if I have to die , as they threaten , I have to help the king .
I wish my eyes were
A conclusion , a conclusion : he is in love .
Hurry , hurry , prepare my horse .
I don't feel guilty about them at all .
Better men than you have heard me speak my mind , and if you can't take it , then you'd better plug your ears .
And yet I feel it's very hot and humid , which is bad for my complexion .
Let me work on him .
After that , nothing can hurt him further , not weapons , poison , rebellion , invasion , or anything else .
He's busy , can't you hear him giving orders ?
I can't stand her .
This storm protects me from thoughts that would hurt me more .
Me too , Lord !
Get out of here , good Fleance , run , run , run !
Do you have what I told you to get ?
Whether your banquet is first or last , your Egyptian cooking will make it the best .
I'm sure you have your hands full preparing for the sudden festivities .
She lied to me , and she may lie to you .
It's fair for him to treat me like this , very fair .
Oh , my good lord , don't make me insult music again with my awful singing .
Well , I'm glad that everything has been sorted out .
Unfaithful ?
I saw the handkerchief .
Though science can explain them away , disasters still come after eclipses .
I demand this in the name of all the saints in heaven .
When they're endangered , I save them .
I wouldn't dream of opposing such an obviously promising idea .
If you complain any more , I'll split an oak tree and lock you up in it till you've howled for twelve years .
I've got my answer .
But now I see our weapons are like straws , our strength like a straw's weakness , and our weakness past comparison , so that we seem to be the thing we most are not .
I think it is , sir .
Do you really think I'm no stronger than the rest of my sex , with such a father and such a husband ?
Do you believe his "offers , " as you call them ?
Lovers , moan and weep .
Let's go !
Is there more work to do ?
Every minute we expect more ships to arrive .
With the quick , intelligent wit she's rumored to have , she can't really be such a bad judge of character that she'd refuse a man as exceptional as Signior Benedick .
Which he quickly allowed , given that you're an obstacle to his lust .
Is that what he says ?
It was a good and lucky vision .
If any of my relatives find you here they'll kill you because of who you are .
Yes , sir .
What foolish thief brags about his crimes ?
Okay , just do this , noble Catesby : sound out Lord Hastings , but make it seem as if you're just mulling over the idea , that it hasn't been firmed up yet .
I used to be the man in the moon a long time ago .
How is my lord ?
Ah , all you up in heaven !
He has always loved Cordelia best , and his bad judgment in disowning her now is obvious .
What's the name of this forest behind us ?
Unkindness is powerful , and his unkindness may kill me , but it'll never destroy my love .
And return to us immediately , bringing Messala with you .
There isn't any kindness in the snake .
Go around the forest , moving faster than the wind , and make sure you find Helena of Athens. , She's lovesick , and her face is pale from all the sighing she's been doing , because sighing is bad for the blood .
I won't listen to your pleas or excuses .
Shame on you !
A jealous woman's poisonous ranting is worse than the bite of a rabid dog .
Give me some trinket of yours , and I will wear it in my hat .
All traitors protest like this .
I wish you and your scarred self had convinced me to wage our last battle on land .
You , constable , are representing the Prince himself .
Ever since I arrived here , just now , I've been hearing strange rumors .
Oh , don't touch me .
Adieu .
She can't even imagine what "love" is .
Oh , it's as easy as lying .
Oh , dear !
On record , my gracious lord .
Shall we get started ?
I've been tricked .
Nothing , my lord , or if I did , I don't know what .
Yes , my lord .
Uncle , this man is a Montague , our enemy .
That's enough about that .
I beg you not to do this , my lord .
Are you wise ?
Nothing .
So , thank God , there is no real need for me , as I wouldn't be able to help you much .
It's too frightened to look at itself .
Call Claudio and some of my other men .
The enemy is making its appearance on the battlefield .
Then you're a better man than the king .
I want to forget what I am .
I'm to blame for making you wait for me .
I won't listen to you .
As for Monsieur Malvolio , let me take care of him .
This is like if I asked you to wear your gloves when it's cold outside , or eat nutritious food , or do something that's good for you .
You must be the one who laughs when boys or women tell you their dreams .
It's not true .
I could drink hot blood and do such terrible deeds that people would tremble even in the daylight .
Go , bring him here , boy .
I can arrange it so that at some indecent hour of the night , she looks out Hero's bedroom window .
No , I must let them find me .
I swear by the sun that when I leave here , it will be as your faithful servant .
The poor souls , how strangely they talk !
Why do you ask ?
That was no show .
If you refuse to allow me to do so , your city's charter and its freedom are endangered .
Tell him to greet the king of England with our sharp defiance .
Go look and then do the talking yourselves .
I knew there would be a masquerade when I got that bad omen of a bloody nose last Easter Monday , at six in the morning , four years after I got the same kind of bloody nose on Ash Wednesday , in the afternoon .
I give you a sister whom I love more than a brother ever loved any sister .
Have your wife attend to her , and bring them along as soon as you can .
I know who you are .
Ah , this place is too cold to be hell .
Between whom ?
Please , my lady , just confirm that you're the lady of the house so I can get on with my speech .
Goodbye .
Good .
Disgusting !
To be brief , as the occasion requires , prepare to fight early in the morning , when your future will be decided .
Come , Grey .
Hello , sir .
It shall be seven o'clock before I get on my horse .
No faithful subject ever rejoiced more at the discovery of most dangerous treason than I now rejoice that I was thwarted in a damnable undertaking .
Don't saints and pilgrims have lips too ?
And to make it even clearer , we can tell them that I'm playing Pyramus but I'm not really Pyramus , really , I'm Bottom the weaver .
The house will be so much quieter .
Don't say that , unless you want to be one of my friends .
I hope you haven't lost your mind .
Laertes , I want you to hear what they say .
I hear someone knocking at the south entry .
When did I ever do you any harm ?
Oh , proud Death , what banquet are you preparing that you've needed to knock off so many princes at one stroke ?
Look at other beautiful girls .
Oh !
Another hit .
I tell you , you've ruined her gown .
Tell me what a drunk is like , fool .
It means being faithful and ready to serve , just like I am for Phoebe .
Good Cinna , take this paper and be sure to lay it in the judge's chair where Brutus sits , so he'll find it .
For Brutus , as you know , was Caesar's angel .
What do you want ?
My money's almost run out .
Not many , and no one important .
The princes are under some strange misunderstanding .
Thus far has our straining author pursued the story with his crude , inadequate writing , keeping important people penned up in this little room while he mangled history's full glory with his uneven telling .
Please , don't forget to leave me a tip .
No .
One of them was a man named Pinch : a hungry , narrow-faced villain ; a skeleton ; a fraud ; a raggedy magician and fortune-teller ; a needy , hollow-eyed , emaciated wretch ; a walking corpse .
Love each other and be friends , like two such men should be .
This is good .
Well , you know , "some are born great , some achieve greatness , and some have greatness thrust upon them." Anyway , I was part of the trick , sir .
And Walter couldn't get his dagger out of its sheath .
Driven ? " Really ?
If he struggles , use force !
Even if she's ugly , she'll be smart enough to find a guy to sleep with her .
Why ?
Or stuff what he says into their pockets .
What support did I have other than Edward ?
I'll go to the right side .
She's yours. , Come , Ariel !
What do you think , Norfolk ?
I'm afraid he will .
Give me a cup of wine .
I will .
If you pursue it , this strict court of Venice will need to carry out the sentence against the merchant there .
Everyone .
How does it feel to be Benedick the Married Man ?
Oh , madam , madam , madam !
Are you considering desertion , as well ?
How can you stand there shamelessly talking about me and Hippolyta , when you know that I know about your love for Theseus ?
Macbeth !
Oh yes , to smell This is Signor Antonio .
Put on a happy face , and welcome your friends .
Follow your spirit , and as you charge cry , "God for Harry , England , and Saint George ! "
No , come on , don't make me play a woman .
For her I'll be strange and condescending , and I'll put on my yellow stockings and crisscross laces right away .
The fact that this summer bird , the house martin , builds his nests here proves how inviting the breezes are .
He really plays well .
I want to use this money to set my father free .
You have to stop talking like this .
Did you talk with him ?
It blushes , is easily embarrassed , and stages regular uprisings in a man's heart .
We're talking here in a public place .
Oh , lovely .
When you begged to stay , that was the time for words .
And I am , I am .
Don't I tell you in the clearest terms that I do not and can not love you ?
Three times today my horse stumbled and started when he looked in the direction of the Tower , as if he hated to carry me to this slaughterhouse .
But why couldn't I say "Amen" ?
The criminal is the one who stole the nest .
Donalbain .
Two of both kinds makes four .
None , my lord .
Well , lead on .
Oh !
Madam wife , they say I've been dreaming or asleep for more than fifteen years .
Well , well , well .
Oh , by this count I'll be many years older before I see my Romeo again .
I want my bond .
Absolutely , people should be what they appear to be .
He insists he'll speak with you whether you want him to or not .
Trebonius knows his cue .
Go tell him about this .
Your Emperor is still a king among gods .
Well , then , help me .
Nothing can come between me and the fulfillment of all my hopes .
A beautiful target is the one that gets hit the fastest .
She'll be buried with her face upwards , then .
Gold , silver , and common lead .
Is there anyone to give the bride away ?
You think it's a big deal that this fierce storm is soaking me to the skin .
Yes , for new lovers time passes ten times faster than for couples who've been married forever .
If he breaks the peace , he ought to enter into a quarrel with fear and trembling .
Bring me face to face with Macbeth , that devil of Scotland .
Why are you so strong and good ?
Are you headed to the Tower ?
You have no reason to say that .
If she orders me to go , I'll thank her warmly as if she'd just offered to put me up for a week .
Be happy about it .
Please , hurry .
Well , he'll be dead , so he won't see anything .
Your Brutus ordered me to give it to you , and I'll do what he says .
Good day , Lieutenant Bardolph .
That really would be kind .
Confess and love" is more like it .
Can you ask around and find out ?
Oh , to think that the same body that once ruled the world could now patch up a wall !
It's the former Hero !
You're not in love either ?
Appear before me now quickly , No talking .
I can't remember anything I've ever done to offend anyone .
Start the fire , good Curtis .
I only partly believe it , for I'm enthusiastic and resolved to meet all dangers without wavering .
Does it really make sense , once we divide the world into three parts , that he should be one of the three rulers ?
Where is that knocking coming from ?
I'll teach you to drink hard by the time you leave .
I'm not sorry , either .
You're wrong about that , I assure you .
Oh , mischief has ruined our plans !
Send something along to prove you're withdrawing the orders .
My master's decision .
In my imagination , Horatio .
You don't know me , but I know you're an important person .
Oh , excellent !
Yes , they are .
Good lord !
Give him my respects , and tell him I'll definitely be there for dinner , since I know he has gone to great lengths for this meal .
I am the son of Marcus Cato !
Who did it ?
I'm glad to see you go .
It's true .
Are you a god , an angel , or a devil , that you make my blood turn cold and my hair stand up ?
Answer all of us , now .
Don't provoke me any further or I'll forget to restrain myself .
Isn't he here ?
Goodbye , you beautiful , cruel woman .
Why do we party until we're like animals ?
Let's have more sex in the world , since Gloucester's bastard son was kinder to him than my daughters , conceived in lawful wedlock , have been to me .
What are you thinking ?
Not really , for the truest poetry is often the most artificial .
You asked for justice , so rest assured you'll get more justice than you bargained for .
I am a gentleman of a company .
Mercutio , be quiet .
I swear , By nothing , because this is no oath .
How can we avoid what the gods want to happen ?
Just read it .
A rotten , foolish monster .
A wonderful miracle !
Are there magic spells that can lead young virgins astray ?
Do this immediately , and don't stop searching and interrogating until you've brought home these foolish runaways .
He drinks like this every night before he goes to sleep .
We thought you ought to know about it .
They're looking for you in the great chamber .
Come , Dolabella .
I hope to God I'm proven wrong !
Oh , oh , oh , oh .
We're all against what Caesar stands for , and there's no blood in that .
Aren't you Kent ?
Are you laughing at what I say , as if I were a fool ?
Eighty ducats in one shot !
He's afraid to come in .
Okay .
Well , first of all , my horse is tired and my master and mistress have had a falling out .
I didn't say anything .
Murder !
If the duke and his court agree to set aside the fine for one half of his property , I'm happy , as long as he lets me have the other half in trust , to give it to the gentleman who recently stole his daughter .
Oh !
I tell you , Charles , he's the stubbornest young fellow in France : overly ambitious , jealous of other people's good qualities , and a traitor against me , his own blood brother .
Oh , my heart !
That banishment is worse than the murder of ten thousand Tybalts .
No , madam , I'm just reading an insane letter .
Oh , Cassio , Cassio , Cassio !
He gets up at nightfall and wanders around till dawn .
Knowing how much I loved my books , he gave me some books from my library that I value more than my dukedom .
Please walk softly , so not even a mole hears us approach .
The moon sets at twelve , right ?
Why should people like me be crawling around between earth and heaven ?
I'll do it , if you help me out .
And your experience makes you sad .
All right , I'll stay another month .
Don't do it , sir .
Coward !
I think she'll be a better soldier .
He who chooses me will get what many men want." What many men want , that "many" could mean that most people are fools and choose by whatever is flashy .
I have to ask you , as a favor , not to let on that you recognize me until the time is right .
Yes , yes .
Dromio , you drone , you snail , you slug , you idiot !
I heard the owl scream and the crickets cry .
I think you're trustworthy one minute and then not the next .
Nonsense !
You've said it , friend , and farewell to you .
I don't have that kind of reputation !
His eyes were as green as leeks .
Go tell the king I want to talk to him for a few minutes .
Just say "Yes" and I will turn more poisonous than the snake with the evil eye .
Judging from his appearance , I bet he can tell us the latest news about the revolt .
Put on my crown .
Come on , sir .
Calphurnia , my wife , is keeping me at home .
Or if you haven't sat as I do now , boring your listener with all your lover's virtues , then you haven't loved .
I'm surprised you enjoy the company of this stupid troublemaker .
I wish you'd won the Something bad in that letter is making Bassanio turn pale .
You tie up horses by their heads , dogs and bears by their necks , monkeys by their waists , and humans by their legs .
What kind of scheme do you have going together ?
If you don't mind , I'd like to speak with you .
I'll head to France soon .
I need to be alone with my thoughts for a while and don't want any company .
Goodbye .
Never , Iago .
You're now within a foot of the cliff's edge .
Where's the passage of holy scripture that you're basing your sermon on ?
Those of you who are young and active , I beg you to follow them and keep them from doing the crazy things their guilt might push them to do .
Don't you remember how he saw a flea land on Bardolph's nose and said it was a black soul burning in hell ?
Speak , speak .
Wherever we go , men will smile at us while hiding daggers .
He's more of a soldier than a wise man .
I'll use Albany's power and authority for now to win the war , but afterward one of the sisters , whichever one wants to , can get rid of him .
You have the power to fix it .
My lord , you don't need to apologize .
I hope this explanation will stand as my excuse .
Not the Adam from the garden of Eden , but the Adam from the jailhouse .
I'll cry at nothing , and I'll always do it when you're in a good mood .
I will say as much to his face .
Is it true that good King Edward has died ?
Why not ?
My lord !
Now I'm scared again .
Our friendship in our schooldays , our childhood innocence ?
But let me see , by ten we shall each have captured a hundred Englishmen .
Day and night , hour after hour , all the time , at work , at play , alone , in company , my top priority has always been to find her a husband .
Ha !
Oh , I followed something I'm ashamed to look at now !
Forgive me , darling Rosalind .
Pronounce them , it is just as nice to say .
Now I'm alone .
Rosalind , I have to leave you for two hours .
Double , double toil and trouble , Fire burn and cauldron bubble .
They plan to spend the night in Sardis .
Ask me any commonsense question .
If you can think of a more awful title , I'll call her that .
Oh , what better favor can I do for you than to kill the man who killed you with the same hand that made you die young .
And I'll go to bed at noon .
I'm going to the Friar to find out his solution .
I beg you , remember the good work I've done for you , and how I've never lied to you , never made mistakes , and never grumbled in my work .
The sailors are all below deck , sleeping both from their labor and from a magic spell I cast over them .
Then he's the whining schoolboy , with a book bag and a bright , young face , creeping like a snail unwillingly to school .
He is in love with Hero .
Read the will !
I'll fight you .
Haven't you made your other love , Demetrius , who kicked me with his foot not long ago , call me a goddess and a divine , rare , precious , heavenly creature ?
I'm glad that my weak words have provoked even this small show of protest from you .
Go on , take them .
Do you even get what I'm saying ?
When you have said your lines , go hide in that bush. , Everyone else , go there too when you're not onstage .
These are the messengers from my sister and the king .
I tell you , though , it's incredible how much she loves me .
I have another plan to make my bird come to me and recognize her owner's call is to keep her from sleeping ,
Oh , he's acting just like Juliet , just like her .
You've heard a lot .
Don't worry about the consequences .
I prefer to call it a "hanger." But anyway .
You blush bright red as soon as you hear any news .
All this suggests that she has a good reason for doing this to you .
No , not until Thursday .
Meanwhile , I'll think of some horrible way to phrase the challenge .
You truly did .
These two Antipholuses , who look so alike , and these two Dromios , who seem to have the same face , and her story of being shipwrecked , why , these two are the parents of these children and have been reunited by accident .
Get going already .
Go !
I'm helping Indeed , sir , find something better to do and get lost for a while .
Just a moment .
Look at you , standing there in a stupor !
Eros , my young friend , your captain is now just like that cloud .
Back so soon ?
In this house lives a man who despises all that is good in you .
I'll be there early .
I , who have heard the rumble of guns in battle , and thunder in the sky ( heaven's version of artillery ) .
How long will a man lie in his grave before he starts to rot ?
I'm begging you .
It's absurd .
Yes , sir .
This is some monster of the island , with four legs , who seems to me to have some kind of ache .
You're right .
What , should I stab him while he sleeps ?
You talk to him , ma'am .
Will it never be morning ?
Tell me so I can be satisfied .
Come on , you .
He's at home , my lord .
I won't move to please anybody .
I go , Caesar .
If our criminal master gets off free , I won't care what happens to me anymore .
Which two crowns would those be ?
I'm too young to remember anything like it .
There's a time for all things .
That must mean a sword .
He liked to call me a loan shark ; let him think about his debt to me .
Maybe I should ask you what right you have to take me , but I'll take you , Orlando , to be my husband .
Some of those lines had more feet than the That's not a problem : the feet can bear Sure , but these feet were
I have neither cleverness nor rhetorical skill nor the authority nor gesture nor eloquence nor the power of speech to stir men up .
I wish I could live longer .
Life , wealth , everything belongs to Death .
My heart is thirsty for that noble promise .
If you ever loved me , then please postpone the sweet relief of death awhile , and stay in this harsh world long enough to tell my story .
A greater power than we can fight has ruined our plan .
Are you familiar with the case currently before the court ?
And he did .
Noble Brutus has mounted the platform .
Where are you , Demetrius , you arrogant bastard ?
Your disloyal uncle , are you paying attention ?
If you put me in the stocks you'll insult him both as a king and as a man .
It's all I can do to keep myself from hanging my head down in despair and singing it like poor Barbary .
Some other time .
Yes , if a woman grows up to be a man .
Then I'd be punished for the sins of my mother .
I know you know something , Thanks for the compliment , I'm happy you know that .
My brave relative !
Where are you going ?
I do , in fact .
Queen , you knew very well that my heart was tied to your ship and that you would pull me along with you .
It's easy for a liar to pretend to feel sorrow when he actually feels none .
What , isn't my mother coming ?
They intend to challenge us here at Philippi , responding to our challenge before we've even challenged him .
Learn to see better , Lear , and let me stay here where you can look to me for good advice .
I wasn't expecting you , and I'm not ready to receive you .
The king will be angry with him .
Well , sir , it's true it came soon after .
Indeed , before he fell down , when he realized the commoners were glad he refused the crown , he pulled open his robe and offered them his throat to cut .
Go back to where you're staying and go to sleep .
Casca , you'll be the first to raise your hand .
It's true I heard a humming sound , a strange one , which woke me up .
Give me some comfort , Nurse .
What a righteous judge !
Then Antony offered it to him again , and he refused it again ( though , in my opinion , he was reluctant to take his hand off it ) .
How will you get proof ?
I'll ask them .
What's the matter with you ?
Yes , my lord .
But let him come .
Please stop turning me around .
I regret not observing him more closely before I told you to do that .
Better , since your lordship was nice enough to ask .
You go down toward the Capitol , and I'll go this way .
Are you going to start eating worms and flies ?
And for the sake of those you grieve for , do me a favor : tell me the full story of what has happened to you and them , up to this point .
Scorn and defiance , indifference , contempt , and any insult that wouldn't disgrace the mighty sender , that's the value he puts on you .
Sleep well there on the ground .
And what's her story ?
I recognize your face perfectly , even without a sailor's cap on your head. , Take him away .
Please , dear , come here .
He does hear me , and that makes me cry .
Many people , men and women alike .
There's a knocking at the gate .
I don't think so .
Actually , an old religious uncle of mine taught me how to speak , and he was brought up in the city .
There may be a time for everything , but no man who has gone bald naturally can get his hair back .
Isn't this Stephano , my drunken butler ?
Civil wounds now can heal , and peace can live again .
I'm a surgeon to old shoes .
Good-bye .
Blow the trumpets .
Let me see , what do you think about falling in love ?
My lord , I have some mementos of yours that I've been meaning to give back to you for a long time now .
Things have certainly changed !
Look , here he comes .
Stop !
You'll Enough of this .
Come on , I won't stand for it anymore .
Ah well , my Kate .
Your Clarence , who stabbed my Edward , is also dead .
What shall I do for you ?
If you've offended him , I'll fight you .
It may be that his antagonist is a gentleman of very high degree , quite outside of his own sphere .
You can push my buttons , but you can't play me for a fool .
Their story is bizarre and astounding , but it's solid and consistent .
A horse , a horse , I'd give my kingdom for a horse !
Your case is most unusual , though the Venetian law can't stop you from proceeding. , Yes , so he says .
Show me the caskets and let me try my luck .
Madam , I've come here to try to make you like him .
And I was right , because where's your husband now ?
You're wrong , you madman .
I'm serious , I can't .
And this is why your servants hang their heads in sorrow !
He plans to leave tomorrow .
He's fine and healthy , madam .
It's true , and he asked me to beg you both to attend .
Liar and slave !
Your lives are over .
No , my noble lord .
I don't believe it .
Look at you !
Are you going to hide and watch them having sex ?
When ?
We're here to say "amen" to that .
Once he's carried our treasure where we want it , we'll free him of the load and turn him loose like a jackass , to shake his ears and graze in the public pastures .
He's as ugly in his manners as he is in appearance. , I will indeed .
Then we won't agree to his demands .
A better example , come on .
I wouldn't have dared !
It has no fighting spirit .
Damn your stones for disappointing me like this !
A jealous woman , a jealous woman !
And what a slug Hastings is that he hasn't even arrived to tell us whether they're coming !
I'll give you frets ! " With that , she clobbers me with the lute so that my head goes right through ,
Don't you trust my sword and these wounds ?
Oh luck , luck .
She's not even fourteen years old .
I hope sores cover your tongue for a wish like that !
I can tell you're furious , but I don't understand what you're saying .
The rapier and the dagger .
Oh sweet mistress , speak !
He's shouting at the wind to blow the earth into the sea , or make the sea flood the earth , he wants to see the world return to primal chaos .
Brother Anthony ,
A man no mightier than you or I in ability , yet grown as huge and frightening as tonight's strange happenings .
Don't you hear me speaking ?
Kinsmen , I hope the time is coming when people will be safe in their own bedrooms .
You didn't want to go then !
Come , warble for me .
Lock the doors .
My employer is as good as yours .
Anyway , my conscience says , "Stay put." "Go , " the devil says .
I overheard him and his plans .
No-the law goes further : if anyone born in Ephesus is seen in Syracuse's marketplaces or if anyone born in Syracuse comes to Ephesus , that man dies , and his possessions will be confiscated by the Duke , unless he can raise a thousand marks to pay the penalty and ransom himself .
You are an honest man .
My lord ?
I just want everything to be all right between you .
Why should he call her a whore ?
I'll let you get away with skipping the praise .
I'd be angry with you if the occasion allowed .
Everyone who comes to gamble on winning me has to swear to these three rules .
Sir , I must get that diamond ring back from you .
You knew that my spirit was completely under your control and that I would ignore the gods' orders in favor of yours .
Take that , and that !
It was carried to Colmekill to be placed in the tomb of his ancestors , where their bones are kept safe .
No , this fun is not for me .
Wake Duncan with your knocking .
But I think , I want to tell you the truth , and now that I think about it , I think this is true , I came here with Hermia .
I thank you , Sir John , with all my heart .
It's as complete a work of villainy as any that could be thought up .
I know where I'll wear this dagger , then .
Oh , right , good Catesby .
Think about it .
The only thing that I've been entrusted with was getting you from the market and bringing you to your house , the Phoenix , for lunch .
Please , young sir .
Speak , man .
Welcome .
How the hell does he know our language ?
make your eyes jump out of their sockets , and your hair stand on end like porcupine quills .
Didn't you just say he was ?
What strange reason could she have for coming here ?
Oh , Cassio , where did you get this ?
What does the golden box say ?
My brother , your uncle Antonio , just listen to this ( I still can't believe a brother could be so disloyal !
Is that a lot of He says his name is Master Fer .
Niece , will you take care of those things I mentioned ?
Tell the hot-headed duke that I, But no , not yet .
Yes , of course .
Women , dress me like a queen .
Did you see that ?
To find a husband for her sister .
We're available .
Why are you curious , Iago ?
Malcolm and Donalbain , the king's two sons , have run away and fled , which makes them the prime suspects .
So now Sweno , the Norwegian king , wants a treaty .
Oh , let her live , and I'll ruin her manners and her beauty .
Yes , but now there's no way to calm him down .
Are you out of your mind and deaf too ?
Should we watch this ridiculous scene ?
Please , pretty young man , I'd like to get to know you better .
I breathed from my soul the most faithful offerings to your ungrateful altars that any devoted person has ever offered , what more am I supposed to do ?
You know the law .
Oh yes .
Why would anyone flatter a poor person ?
You get only one round .
It's not the right time to play .
I'll humor him when he learns how to behave .
Shall we not ?
Yes , it's definitely nippy .
Leave now .
I probably am too young for you .
Don't hurt me .
Let me lick your shoe .
Really , the priest was good enough , no matter what that old guy said .
No one has ever faked passion as skillfully as this , then .
I'll torment them all till they roar with pain .
Then I guess beggars are the ones with bodies , while ambitious kings and heroes are just the shadows of beggars .
I won't leave him alone until he gives Cassio his job back. , How are you , my lord ?
What a man ! , especially compared to my husband .
And didn't they place the wreath of victory on my brow and order me to give it to you ?
Well , good luck !
Look , here comes the fool .
He must do this , or I'll recant the pardon I just delivered .
It is my rival for Bianca .
Just now a tailor showed me fabrics he bought especially for me and then started to take my measurements .
There is a particular lord who will watch you perform tonight .
Good day to both of you .
It's almost ten o'clock .
The moon looks sad to me .
A strange fish .
But if you had to say something nice about me , what would you say ?
Besides , they're fresh .
Oh God , did Romeo's hand shed Tybalt's blood ?
He was an admirable king .
Great happiness !
This poor guy's partly confessed his plan .
Men act imprudently sometimes , then realize their mistakes when they have time to think about them .
Give my love to my kind husband .
Lieutenant Cassio will be on guard duty tonight .
We'll look for new friends and keep the company of strangers .
The powerful dukes Gloucester and Buckingham .
I told you , sir , they were totally drunk , so puffed up with courage that they were getting angry at the air for blowing in their faces , and beating the ground for touching their feet , yet even when drunk , they kept their plan firmly in mind .
I would die of pity to see someone else in my condition .
Are your tears wet ?
I'm sorry you're leaving my father like this .
Thank you for that joke .
I'll recite something for you , guy .
I feel bad for scaring you like this , but it would be much worse for me to let you come to harm .
Ah ha !
Is there more news ?
We've got to give them and take them , my lord .
I respect the soul very much , so I disagree with his belief .
You smiled with a strength you must have gotten from heaven , while I cried salty tears into the salty sea , and groaned at our situation .
Can you buy them with money ?
When I like the way you look , for God forbid your face be as ugly as your mask !
All right , then .
Caesar , you're not going to be killed by a traitor , unless you kill yourself..
Wouldn't he be a comfort to us in our travels ?
My situation is desperate .
No , noble Romeo , you've got to dance .
Then make a circle around Caesar's corpse , and let me show you the man who made this will .
So is my horse , Octavius , and for that reason I give him all the hay he wants .
A sense of security opens the door to conspiracy .
Sweet Montague , be true .
But in return , please , do one thing for me : leave me alone for a little while .
Who said that ?
Give our officers notice of our intentions .
Wait , countrymen .
If I may say so , your Majesty , as I see it he would be a coward and a villain not to .
Look at you getting all riled up !
Lord , may I never see a day of trouble until the day I let someone treat me like that .
Now that I think about it , I really want it .
Just look at me kindly , and I'm invincible against their hatred .
Tell us .
I could have blown up the town in an hour .
It's nice of you to remind me .
Good heavens , those are difficult directions .
Why did I ever have one ?
And here comes father .
How much does he owe the Jew ?
Now I'll go see my priest , to ask for his help and tell him about my good luck .
Help me , help me !
That's no way to pray .
Right now ?
I'm afraid it will make you too hot , too .
Eat and sleep .
In fact , I'd do even more to him than what you've heard him promise to do .
Soon enough .
Just say it .
I'd like to introduce you to my friend .
My lord , I don't think I cried out .
Mankind is so beautiful !
Let Rome fall !
Go away .
If we meet again , then we'll smile .
We'll begin the ceremony the way we hope it will end , with delight .
You sing , and I'll dance .
I'm just sorry I had to be the one to kill him .
Oh , my lord , you once said that lazy weeds grow fast .
Why Dover ?
No , I think there's more to this than you're letting on .
They grow like savages , like soldiers who meditate on nothing but blood , surrounded by swearing and stern looks , ragged clothing and everything unnatural .
If I have killed your children , I will have children with your daughter .
Yes indeed it is , sir .
As for your coming in to dinner , just do what you feel is right .
So please listen to me .
What are they doing on the road ?
I got this purse full of money from you , and my Dromio brought it to me .
Friar !
And here comes the warden , just in time .
Where is my gracious lord of Canterbury ?
Of course I hear it .
If you knew the reason , you'd understand and would urge me to go rather than stay .
Moors are moody people. , So sell your lands and raise a lot of cash .
When I've plucked this rose , I can't make it grow again ; it will have no choice but to wither and die .
Dorset has fled to the earl of Richmond .
My gallant girls !
My only sin was loving you too much .
I'll carry prayer books in my pocket and look sweet , even more .
I tried to play games with God , and he turned my fake prayer on my head , giving me for real what I'd asked for as a joke .
Nothing .
For three months , hmmm .
His beard was gray , right ?
Everything about this is unnatural !
Sometimes she tickles a priest's nose with a Enough , enough !
My lord , when I first saw him I thought he was your daughter's brother .
You can't judge me based on what I do tonight .
What did I keep for myself ?
But I'll go in .
Whose was it ?
Who's that ?
I won't stay behind .
I know where she is and , if you don't mind , I will set her before you tomorrow , whole and unharmed .
You pretty lovers are lucky you met me here .
You have forgotten , and you think it's a burden when I ask you to walk through the ocean , or run on the north wind , or do business for me underground when the earth's frozen solid .
To which we all appeal .
No .
We'd find that he was a dangerous plotter .
And weren't you the one who made him cheat on all of his other girlfriends , like Aegles , Ariadne , and Antiopa ?
I'll read you a sermon .
Amen !
And time itself is ended .
That's another sin arising from your ignorance : you bring ewes and rams together and make your living by their copulation .
So I welcome this wind freely .
If I'd been a common laborer and hadn't taken him up on his offer , to hell with me .
Good countrymen , let me leave alone .
I came here with a fool's head on my shoulders and now I'm leaving with two. , Goodbye , sweet lady .
Then I heard the trumpets blow twice , and left him there in a trance .
I want my sword .
Come out , I order you .
Oh , I'm sure you don't dislike him so much as to wish he were here alone , even though you say this to find out how the rest of us feel .
Come on , sister .
No , cousin , I'm crying .
I'll take the banner from a trumpeter and use that .
That's true .
I don't have the thing that makes time fly .
I even knew the tailor who made the disguise she wore when she ran off .
It's not good for your health , either .
Oh , come on , woman .
Come on , you and I will go soon .
And look how he's repaid poor Clarence for his loyalty , penned him up like a pig being fattened for slaughter .
Come with me , my dear Cordelia .
Good Portia , go to bed .
I hope he's grown a lot since I last saw him .
What do you think , girl !
But here are other matters to be dealt with .
If you meet the Prince in the night , you can order him to stop .
If we can not defend our country with three times such a power left at home , then we deserve to be harassed by an invader and lose our reputation as a powerful and politically savvy nation .
Please come with me .
Sweet Sir Andrew !
Or walk either .
If luck deserts us today , it's because we defy it .
And if the enemy is an ass and a fool and a prating idiot , does that mean , you think , that we should also be an ass and a fool and a prating idiot ?
A friend would never see those faults .
Sir , I leave you to your own contentment .
So don't spend one night away from this house .
I'll punish you so harshly that you'll regret causing me this loss .
So confess your sin freely now .
Stand back , boy .
All that glitters is not gold , You've often heard that said .
Since I was three years old , I've been in contact with a powerful but virtuous magician , no black magic here .
No , with Demetrius .
There's no doubt that Petruchio's got quite a catch .
I know you .
A man with a wife like that might ask , "Hey , wandering wit , where are you off to ? " Nah , better save the questions for when you find her in your neighbor's bed .
Oh , heaven help us !
Why , you speak like an experienced and quiet watchman .
I hate your logic as much as I hate an empty drinking cup .
You do me wrong by taking me out of the grave .
What music should we play then ?
He'll be like this for a little while .
Therefore tell me the Dauphin's mind frankly and without constraint .
Will you pull your sword out of its sheath ?
Your whole family will be ruined .
Don't you hear it ring ?
Go get some water and wash this bloody evidence from your hands .
I hate the word peace like I hate hell , all Montagues , and you .
Watch him closely .
And so do I , my lord .
Let's be sacrificers but not butchers , Caius .
Please Margaret , help me write this poem for Beatrice .
I'll take you to a place where you can speak freely .
You won't kill me , will you ?
Tomorrow you need to get more money sent to you .
Believe me , I'll draw my sword as quick as any other man if I see a fight starting and the law is on my side .
It's cheap and nasty !
Friends , go .
Let me keep weeping for such a great loss .
Exactly .
I couldn't see you , Lysander , but I heard your voice , and that's how I found you .
I'm out of breath , sir .
It'll help us more than hurt us .
Yes , with the sign underneath him that says : "Here lives Benedick the married man" ?
Oh , quick , before I'm gone .
If that's what you mean , I'll melt this gold and pour it down your throat that speaks these hateful words .
Did he marry me just to starve me ?
Anger does not protect the angry well .
The second I saw you , my heart rushed to serve you and be your slave , so here I am now , a patient log-man .
The people have heard it already , and they've been told of his accusations .
Here comes the man who rescued me , sir .
His name's Cinna .
Listen , but don't speak .
In that case , if I can wear a mask , let me play Thisbe too !
And I know that by now they're waiting for me on the porch outside Pompey's theater .
And tonight , sir , I invite you have dinner with me .
Take this .
If he'd written nice things , I'd swear yes right away .
Don't tell us what our duty is .
Fix your example , shepherd .
Your hand is Well , I hope so .
What should we say , my lord ?
Calm down .
Since this prize is yours , Be happy with it , and don't look for a new one .
Was there ever a match put together so quickly ?
What's the "seventh cause" ?
You have my friendship .
I won't be a soldier anymore .
Now this is where you come in .
So how's my nephew Hamlet doing ?
There's no other shelter around here .
Then I'll call you a serving-creature .
Who's taken over the watch for you ?
Please , tell me more .
But I'm sorry I've blurted all this out .
But the really unbelievable thing is , and this is incredible , As most unbelievable things are .
But you're all wound up about fashion , too .
What do you think , madam ?
It's like a monster that just grows and grows , out of nothing .
But both of these were put off by Elizabeth Grey , a careworn mother of many children who had once been a beauty but was now a stressed-out widow long past her prime .
I'm tired and feeling heavy , but I can't sleep .
I don't know , madam .
So far I've done exactly what I was supposed to do , I put the love potion on an Athenian's eyes .
If God had been willing , I wish we had died in the same hour too !
If love plays rough with you , play rough with Come on , let's knock and go in .
Too late is more like it .
But do you think that's what he's aiming for ?
But , tell me , where is the noble Richmond now ?
The best plays are still only illusions , and the worst are just as good , if you just use your imagination to fill them in .
Nurse !
A soothsayer tells you to beware of March 15th .
I'll challenge him .
The devil sings like a nightingale to haunt Poor Tom .
Go wisely and slowly .
It only looks a little paler .
His heart used to burst the buckles on his breastplate in great fights , but now he's lost all temperance and dedicates his heart to satisfying the lust of an Egyptian whore .
I got it from him .
Okay , let's go !
I certainly do have him , but I wouldn't advise you to touch him .
That would be a little extreme !
Amen to that .
Did I work to make him king for this ?
What else is love ?
Here .
I shall , King Harry .
You'd better think up a way to defend yourself .
How are you ?
I thumb my nose at superstitions .
I beg the court to deliver the verdict .
Caesar wrote for him to come to Rome .
Listen , if you want a good laugh , and I mean a side-splitting one , then follow me .
Delighted to hear you ask so nicely , but I won't stay in any case .
Oh , my !
But don't I have good reason to cry ?
If there's any good deed I can do that will bring you peace and me honor , speak to me .
Tell me .
Is Antonio here ?
Show us the way without further delay. , Trinculo , since the king and all our comrades are drowned , we're the heirs of this place. , Here , carry my wine bottle. , Trinculo , my buddy , we'll get that bottle refilled soon enough .
Excellent .
Come here , you .
That was one hit .
No , no , the bell .
He certainly is .
They both begin with the letter "R." Ah , you jokester , that's the dog's name .
Not yet .
A victory in battle is twice as victorious when all the soldiers return home safely .
This is a stranger business than men have ever set foot in before , and it's not natural either .
I have no doubt about that , since I know there isn't a man among us who isn't with me wholeheartedly , or a soul left behind who doesn't wish us success and conquest .
Gentlemen , calm down .
This doesn't look like a wedding .
Why do you say that ?
Are you trying to start a fight ?
At my house .
I won't be kind to you .
Yes , she said that .
Oh , you excellent young man !
That's impossible .
If true lovers are always thwarted , then it must be a rule of fate .
Come , sweet nymphs , and help us celebrate the wedding of two true lovers .
Good , sir ?
Light the candles !
I'll be at your service .
Get down and swear it .
Is it a weakness ?
I'll expect you .
Your grave is gaping open , and your death is near .
Fool , fool , hey , fool !
Like hell she is !
Swear by her foot , so she can stamp out the oath .
Where is that damned wretch , Tranio , who defied me in such a disgraceful manner ?
Pardon , dear father .
The heavens only announce the deaths of princes .
I'm left with nothing to do in this weak , idle peacetime , unless I want to look at my lumpy shadow in the sun and sing about
Yes .
Let go of him , peasant , or you die !
Even though I don't see it , this lady thinks I'm a marvelously good-looking man .
Yes , if that would be all right with your Lordship .
What's the reason for this horrible shouting ?
You're up early .
Now , Titania , wake up , my sweet queen .
Hey , if I lay down my " Welcome , Lorenzo and Salerio .
Oh dear gods !
Here comes the little villain herself .
So tell me what's been going on .
We're done for !
A good reputation is the most valuable thing we have , men and women alike .
I answered that Lepidus had become too brutal and abused his position .
You see how the world goes , Volumnius .
Yes , for your own safety , you should deny one thing : you have been a great thief at sea .
You'll have to bear with me .
I'm sorry about what happened , but I'm sure everything will turn out all right .
Get out of my sight !
Oh no !
If he's ready now , so am I .
No , I swear on my honor , I haven't , madam .
Tomorrow I'll send the messenger .
Hide behind the boxwood hedge , all three of you .
Look after my goods and possessions .
Stop fooling around .
Like gambling , sir ?
Then do my lips now have the sin they took from yours ?
You have .
I'll wear a big sword in my belt , carry a boar-spear in my hand , and hide all my womanish fear in my heart .
Your vote will be as strong as anyone's in the reordering of the government .
which any peace-lover can do .
You'd give the moon a shove if it got stuck five weeks in its orbit .
Since you love money and power so much , I won't be your wife .
Tortured ,
Then heaven have mercy on me !
I must admit your offer is the best .
Why would they do that , my lord ?
No doubt , no doubt .
I myself am the King of Naples , since I saw with my own eyes , these eyes that haven't been dry since , my father killed in a shipwreck .
Didn't you hear it ?
How strange that they all got so sleepy !
My lord , it's news I wish I didn't have to report .
My brains are injured .
Look , here comes Helena .
How long has he been there ?
Hello , my friends !
I'll bring you to him .
I think I hear them .
Let four captains carry Hamlet like a soldier onto the stage .
Pharmacist !
I bet my life on it .
Your Majesty , see here , if it won't offend your Grace , what a complete , rascally , beggarly , lousy rat this is .
But like a misbehaved , sullen girl , you're whining about your bad luck and your love .
You are welcome here , my friends .
Nah , I don't care what their
Yes , I was , but I don't want an answer from you .
You who are beautiful beyond words , calm down and let me explain myself .
Now my spells are all broken , And the only power I have is my own , Which is very weak .
But let's see once more what the gold one says : "He who chooses me will get what many men want." That's Portia !
If I default , he'll pay you .
Not at all , Touchstone .
We don't want it at our festivities .
The food inside is warm , but you're out here freezing .
The Tower's chaplain has buried them , but to tell you the truth , I don't know where .
Enough of this .
And then you'll see that despite what you thought , I'll be as powerful as I was before .
Get up .
Where is my husband ?
Listen to me , you traitor .
I'll go and join my men .
These two people are as identical as two halves of an apple .
No , not at all .
We know you have a job to do , Brakenbury , and we'll do what you say .
Don't dishonor your mothers !
Twelve years ago , Miranda , twelve years ago your father was the Duke of Milan , a powerful prince .
I'm like the one sick sheep in the flock , the one who deserves to die .
Here's where they'll end up , on the floor .
Let me say first , madam , that he is well .
Let's fall on our swords .
There ! , And over there ! , And over there !
They don't want you to go out today .
And that would be , ?
Never , my lord .
Monster , use your fingers .
That's the way it goes .
You wrong me even more , sir , by denying it .
Please , sir , don't trouble yourself .
No , they're busy and as excellent as ever .
Lysander , say something !
Enough , cousin .
Don't follow me .
I think it would be very hard to arrange for them to have sex while you watched .
As Edgar , I'm nothing at all .
How dare you tell us about God's laws when you have broken them so savagely yourself ?
Then , to answer every man briefly , wisely , and truthfully , wisely I say , I am a bachelor .
How ingenious to make horseshoes out of felt .
What has the governor of the town decided ?
Beat them down !
Where is my wife ?
God keep me so. , Heralds , go with him .
Yes , " said my uncle Gloucester , "Small plants are graceful , while ugly weeds grow fast." And since then , I've wished I wouldn't grow so fast , because sweet flowers are slow while the weeds grow in a hurry .
Good sir , this ring was given to me by my wife .
No one may be bolder than my Lord Hastings .
Not much .
That's comforting .
Come forward and speak .
Either you , or I , or both of us have to go with him .
Yes , let's go to sleep .
He's going after a young widow .
You have impatience all over your face .
But you didn't , even though you had every reason .
Where's your lute ?
I don't think there's anywhere I'd rather die than in the king's company , as his cause is just and honorable .
Who heard me do that ?
I promise I will .
I'm in a good mood now and likely to give you what you want .
We come here to help you and you treat us like thugs , but you let an African horse climb all over your daughter .
Investigate how this foul murder came about .
Oh God !
I'd send seven of my servants to go get him .
Then you and I and all of us fell down , while bloody treason triumphed .
Have a good night !
Just being thanked is more than enough for me , madam .
That's what I said when I first conjured the tempest .
Now heaven has her .
I'll reward you for your troubles .
The money you owe me for the necklace .
Good night , dear Captain Blunt .
He did ask for mercy .
There are enough of us still alive in the field to overcome the English with our numbers if we could just restore some kind of order .
Where is my lord , the duke of Gloucester ?
If my eyes don't deceive me , you are my Rosalind .
It'll be worth your while .
I'm telling you , it was Carthage .
Because their business lies outside the home .
No .
I'll do that .
Good God , I was about to say something .
A rebel !
I hid under this monster's cloak to get out of the storm .
I have .
To leave his wife , his children , his house , and his titles in a place so unsafe that he himself flees it !
I don't know what else it could be .
Look , here she comes !
Yes .
When you've finished all this , return to the porch of Pompey's theater , where you'll find us .
First of all , my house in the city , as you know , is filled with expensive furniture and household articles , china and gold , basins and pitchers for her to wash her dainty hands in .
No , I won't take a husband until they make men out of something other than dirt .
Maybe she's just pretending .
This one ?
Good-bye .
I will too .
Ensign , what's he doing in there ?
Is she as tall as I am ?
Why do you think I'm making fun of you when I tell you I love you ?
Brutus killed me .
Oh , don't worry about it , we'll dip your I'll get you for that one .
Who's there ?
I'm about to fly away .
That guy's funny .
That's Claudio .
If I'm going to sing along with you , I need to know what key you're singing in .
Oh , Sir Toby , stop !
How's the prince ?
There's other work for you to do .
You don't need it yet .
But aren't there some healthy men whom we have to make sick ?
It's a strange snake .
Claudio deserves to be honored , and Don Pedro has rewarded him accordingly .
Then hurry up and rush over to Friar Lawrence's cell .
Sweet flowers for a sweet girl .
Oh , my lord , what do you mean by that ?
Doesn't he deserve it ?
If you like , you can rest a while in my room .
If she is silent and won't speak at all , I'll praise her chattiness and say she speaks with piercing eloquence .
He's lying through his teeth !
Yes , my lord , if you would like .
I know this quality in you , Brutus , it's as familiar to me as your face .
No , no , with God's help , his son will be king .
My lord , I have news for you .
I'll make you sing .
Ophelia , come here. , I hear him coming .
Oh , you If you want to praise Caesar , just say his name , that's all the praise that's necessary .
Is it because of
Hooray !
I'm ready and waiting. , Give me your hand , Bassanio .
You haven't seen anything , then ?
And you , sweet Hero ?
Don't swear at all .
Here comes the lady .
What do you mean ?
Or at least that's what I plan to do before I let you go .
That's the way a good deed shines in a naughty world .
Therefore tell me , fairest Katherine , will you have me ?
She's full of good intentions .
I'll bandage up these wounds and swear I got them in the French wars .
But please tell me , who's his best friend ?
I haven't seen you since you sent me to the Centaur with the gold you gave me .
Well , then , what should we do for fun instead ?
Since the wall is conscious , it should curse back at him .
You'll just lie there like sleeping dogs and say nothing .
Thanks , good Egeus .
How are you , my golden girl ?
Follow her .
I'll fight until they hack the flesh off my bones .
What a pain .
Where is Lucentio ?
Tell him to gather together the greatest army he can muster in a hurry and meet me right away at Salisbury .
If he has a face like yours , a good scratching couldn't make him look any worse .
Whenever you like .
But my daughter should know about this , so she can be prepared with an answer just in case .
Good morning , noble sir .
What's this noise ?
These are a man's words , and his handwriting .
Where should we meet ?
I can't speak to her , even though she asked me to .
I will not trade my horse for any that walks on four legs .
Let's go to this great feast .
I'll go see my mother soon .
I think he will stand strong with us .
Our noblemen are battling bravely .
This dream has been interpreted all wrong .
I know you well .
These are ugly antics .
Since my beauty no longer pleases my husband , I'll weep away what's left and then die with weeping .
Oh , how awful !
Launcelot and I can't agree on anything .
Tyrants themselves wept when they heard about it .
Defend me , God , both when I'm asleep and when I'm awake .
I hate my name , dear saint , because my name is your enemy .
If Well , I'll just forget the difficulties of my situation , in order to focus on the happiness of yours .
If you close the doors on a woman's wit , it'll fly out the window .
James Tyrrel , and your most obedient subject .
If he backs down , he'll become as notorious a villain and as saucy a Jack as ever walked on God's earth , in my opinion .
No , boy .
First rehearse your song from memory , and make sure each note is pretty .
Caliban !
And if your love can produce something from its sadness , write a poem for her ; hang it on her grave and sing it to her bones .
Tomorrow night make sure that you are alone .
And Trinculo's drunk .
How are things now ?
This is the man .
But why , you villain , did you kill my cousin ?
Darling Kate !
I'm going to take it from you now .
He was covered with blood from his helmet to his spurs .
Are Decius Brutus and Trebonius there ?
If you hope to have your sins forgiven by Christ's dear blood , which He shed for our terrible sins , you must leave and keep your hands off me .
Sneaky , dried-up old coot !
Here I am , Theseus .
Take my remark in whichever sense you like .
You call that ranting ?
To , to , to , To murder me ?
In prison we'll outlast hordes of rulers that will come and go as their fortunes change .
You're right , that's how it is .
Please find a way to give me some time alone with Desdemona , if you think that's all right .
Not in the stocks , fool .
Come on , music !
My royal lord , you're not entertaining the guests .
Anything .
I knew you'd turn out this way .
You're a hardworking villain who'd do anything his evil mistress wanted him to .
Good-bye , until you return tonight .
I'm at your service .
What garment would your Honor like to wear today ?
And in the morning I'll take you to your ship and we'll sail to Naples , where I hope to see this loving couple married .
It's the smartest partition I've ever heard speak , my lord .
I have a good reason to cry , but my heart will splinter into a hundred thousand pieces before I let myself cry. , Oh , Fool , I'll go mad !
Read the time there .
I don't mean that she wants me because What's she like ?
But still , she's going to kill you for being gone so long .
Tell me what you've done with the money I entrusted to you .
He's his homeland's jewel .
Be wise when you criticize me and keep your minds alert so you can judge me fairly .
I hope you remember that I said all this because I love you .
Leave him alone .
Lovely Katherine , if you will love me well with your French heart , I'm happy to hear you confess it in broken English .
My lord , he refuses to come .
My mind and courage will never falter with doubt or shake with fear .
Lady , come out of the tomb .
I see you don't intend to part with her , or perhaps you don't like my company .
A man old Frederick , your father , loves .
Oh , my handsome nephew , I must not say that .
But things have changed there , and it's easier for them on the road now .
You're a man with a good reputation .
I do the wrong and am the first to start quarrels .
Is that how it is , countrymen ?
Let me borrow a mirror .
Oh , sir , pardon me !
Why does it matter that I'm not as lucky or lovable as you are and that the love I feel is unrequited ?
I served Mark Antony , who was the commander most worthy of my services .
I am satisfied .
I tell you truly , in true English : I love you , Kate .
Yes , my lord .
There !
I hope you're not trying to cheat me .
This is old Ninny's tomb .
What kind of crude jerk are you ?
Do I know these men who are with you ?
Then she is well , and nothing is wrong .
And yet I still regret the anger that drove me to kill them .
Everything that made me worry about my ships would make me sad .
But , unfortunately , Caesar has to bleed if we're going to stop him .
Do your job .
Will the moon be shining on the night we're performing our play ?
How ?
Romeo .
What , faithful to being mean and nasty ?
He looks like someone with a strange tale to tell .
I have my naked sword out .
No , he loves and cherishes me .
Where are his eyes ?
Helena , it's not true .
Bring him my head .
I pray to God he isn't .
My cousin Westmoreland ?
Two of them are completely honorable , and if they have been tricked in this , we must blame John the Bastard , who lives to create conflict .
Thanks for your company but , really , I would have preferred being alone .
Before I fall asleep , I entrust my soul to you .
I know the boy will be a convincing gentlewoman , taking up her exact walk and talk and gentle gestures .
Let's go forth , dear countrymen .
Ride , ride , Messala , ride , and give these dispatches to our forces on the other side .
But you see my finger doesn't have the ring on it .
You're in trouble either way .
Sir , I tell you we believe you're both lying criminals .
Oh , gods , give me patience !
Is that true , my lords of England ?
Did you say all ?
Now please listen , sir .
Actually I think I would , and then I'd undo it after I did it .
Tell him I'll take the leek out of his hat on Saint Davy's Day and slap his head with it .
Oh , Cleopatra !
Lily-livered coward , what's he doing there ?
Now , my lord , what are we going to do if we find that Lord Hastings won't go along with our plans ?
I swear on my life I won't tell your secret .
There's still a stain on your cheek from an old tear that hasn't been washed off yet .
Bellario sends his greetings .
Lysander I want to stop , but Hermia stops my heart from beating .
All the spirits hate him as much as I do .
I'll give it a try .
Yes , God be praised , I have managed to earn his favor .
I , who have survived storms at sea where the winds raged like wild animals ?
Anyway , he is what he is .
In fact , she's crazed .
Beware the thane of Fife .
Don't say anything else .
He was dressed so oddly too !
What proof is there ?
That's good , if he'll really do it .
Besides , his cottage , his flocks , and his grazing rights are on sale now , and since he's not there , there's nothing to eat at our house .
Well , brighter lights always dim the smaller ones .
Well , that's what the wife brings to the marriage .
What's that noise ?
Here I am .
You can do whatever you want as long as it's socially appropriate .
You should say , "I sort of know him , but not well .
He's at the duke's morning and night , accusing the state of harming free trade if they deny him justice .
For lead ?
Leave him to my wrath. , Edmund , go with my sister-in-law .
I'll give you the most expensive ring in Venice , and I'll make a public announcement to help me find it .
I'll go back to sleep now .
Here , sir , this is a ring she asked me to give you .
Yes , as short as a woman's love .
That's a good thing to put in , it keeps you from getting in trouble with the law .
Welcome , my lord .
Signior Baptista , I'm actually in a bit of a hurry .
The first time we see the world as newborns , we cry and scream .
I won't hide unless all the mist from my heartsick groans envelopes me like fog and conceals me from people's searching eyes .
The voice kept crying , "Sleep no more ! " to everyone in the house .
Pick up the corpses .
Tell me who shall have the better luck , Caesar or me ?
But my hair looks good anyway , doesn't it ?
To Baptista Minola's house .
Because I'm a Jew .
You do their work for them and give them good luck .
Is it time , my Lord Constable ?
Am I a coward ?
Let's proceed on our march to Birnam .
It won't annoy you like me , because it doesn't have a voice .
Madam !
Oh , go , leave me .
It
This is his second fit like this .
Come on , let's go at it , Macduff , and damn the first man who cries , 'Stop !
Please , marry us .
Eros , send his treasure to him .
Come on , tie them up .
I recognize something about that voice .
It would be a pity to throw them away for nothing , but if it's a matter of choosing between them and a great cause , then they're worthless .
The devil inside him is rough , but we can't treat it roughly .
I see the downfall of my family .
Many men would take you literally and take off with all this money .
Who's that ?
I'm sorry , sir , but in this war I consider you a subordinate , not my equal .
This lantern represents the moon .
I'll think it over .
It's always better to get rid of what you're scared of than to be afraid .
Huntsman , look after my hounds .
And yet you're the one who wants to teach me about restraint !
Some villains in my court must have known about this and let it happen .
Oh Margaret , Margaret , your heavy curse has now landed on poor Hastings's miserable head !
I would , my boy .
Hello there , good sirs .
Learn from the wise , and comprehend : the courtier's perfume is made from cat discharge , much more disgusting than tar .
Oh , be quiet .
Eyes , do you see ?
So will we all .
What is it , Octavia ?
You know tomorrow is her wedding day .
It would follow from this that the cat should stay home .
Benedick's heart is like a bell , with his tongue as the clapper : everything his heart thinks , his tongue speaks .
Who do you mean ?
Don't talk to me .
This is how they do it , sir : they measure the depth of the Nile , according to certain marks made on the walls of the Pyramid .
I don't know .
Please tell me , who is this man ?
She can turn and turn , and then turn on you again .
I'm going back into battle .
I have an aunt who is a widow , who's very rich and doesn't have any children .
That's the right answer , it shows your love .
Shouldn't she just accept that ?
I'll get the general's surgeon .
He will if he lives long enough to become a man .
But please tell me , is my boy , God rest his soul , alive or dead ?
Come and get it !
Why are you whispering ?
Take pity on Poor Tom , who is persecuted by the devil .
You mean however they dare .
Freedom !
Let Merriman catch his breath , the poor dog's foaming at the mouth .
He wants to eat the English .
You're wise !
I rely on your virtue to protect me .
Now go and get me some booze .
Do you like pictures ?
But Brutus says he was ambitious , and Brutus is an honorable man .
Get away from me , you ass !
Give me some wine and let me say a few words .
What do you think he wants ?
Everyone else will have to stay single .
Wretched boy , you hung out with him here , and you're going to go to heaven with him .
Believe me , I'm sorry you're in pain .
Unless I am mistaken , Signior Baptista may remember me from the Pegasus in Genoa , where we both stayed twenty years ago .
I didn't find him at the Elephant .
Hit them !
There was no limit to what his lustful eye and savage heart would prey on .
I think he's actually serious , and not just being polite .
This is the devil Flibbertigibbet .
Yes , sir , it's all too true , God help us .
He ran to his house , stunned .
Yes , what about him ?
Yes , my lord .
But he'd been there before me , and they told me he'd gone out looking for me .
I'm wounded .
Fine , but you weren't harsh enough .
Go on .
I'd like you to , see , because you don't like it , and because it isn't to your taste , and because it doesn't agree with you .
Tell me , is it missing ?
Remember your children as being sweeter than they actually were , and think of the man who killed them as worse than he is .
So Litio's out of the picture .
You think so ?
It was incredible !
The devil in him is strong !
Yes , he will , and the queen as well .
Is it good news ?
And there's nothing I can do about it .
Where's Cesario going ?
My father can't think straight , a hundred knights !
The captain who brought me to shore has my women's clothes .
You should have reprimanded him for that .
I'll help you through this business .
Take whatever wife you want to bed with you , You'll have a fool's head forever .
It was yesterday , your highness .
Don't talk about Helena .
Who's there ?
So you're admitting Clarence , my father , is dead .
Did you plan Cassio's death with him ?
Your love says , like an honorable gentleman , who is courteous , kind , handsome , and , I believe , virtuous , where is your mother ?
You purple flower , hit by Cupid's arrow , sink into the pupils of this man's eyes .
Do as you please , because I'm done worrying about you .
I can't believe my sister would neglect her obligations in any way .
Boy !
You said it right , old mole .
Yes , sir , we hope so .
This is Casca .
If I answered that question , I'd be making confession to you .
Nice save !
What role did you play ?
If she can't find out what his secret is , then send him off to England or wherever you think best .
Besides , according to the French historians , King Pepin , who deposed Childeric , based his own claim to the crown of France on his descent from Blithild , the daughter of King Clothair .
You've only insulted yourself .
Me too .
Did it really work ?
Yes , and be wise .
Please stay seated .
Here are my keys. , But why should I go ?
you , as sure as your name's Roderigo , if I were the Moor I wouldn't want to be Iago .
A snake could do that as easily as you could .
Do you understand what I'm saying , man ?
I'll also wear this in my cap .
And can a person ever have too much of a good thing ? , Come on , sister , you can be the priest and marry us. , Give me your hand , Orlando. , What do you say , sister ?
And throw this dead peasant into the manure pit. , Regan , I'm bleeding .
Yes , I do , lady .
Yes , in a very gentlemanly way .
Making your loss greater makes the person who caused it worse .
I'll do everything she wants me to do .
Can your man keep a secret ?
Why is that ?
How is Hamlet ?
But a stronger pity , for the wrongs committed against Rome , drove out our pity for Caesar , as fire drives out fire , and so we killed him .
Like a good doctor .
There's only one body here .
Oh , sir , Don't think I'm flattering you .
I've felt neglected recently , but I decided that it was more likely that I was being hypersensitive than that they were intentionally unkind .
Accept it in body and spirit .
Your name's Gloucester .
I swear , if anyone holds me back , I'll make a ghost of him !
Amen !
Do you recognize the handwriting ?
Fool , do not flatter yourself .
Let's hope we never need your help for anything .
And wouldn't I be damned if I let this monster live to do more harm ?
What do you say ?
You thug !
Our forces are ready for them .
Go , girl , look for a man who'll give you happy nights at the end of happy days .
The Queen is coming .
I want to be this Duke's servant .
But that's not part of what I'm supposed to say .
Indeed , honor is what I want to talk to you about .
Meanwhile I'll stay with Regan with my hundred knights .
But his punishment was bitter death .
I'm crying at how unworthy I am to give you what I want to give you and to take what I'm dying to have .
Yes , heavily .
And now it looks like you need my help .
Bless you , master .
Your father was an extremely moral man , and religious people get odd ideas on their deathbeds .
Will you be crowned tomorrow ?
I wish that were true for both our sakes !
I could take back my crown by force , What outrageous ingratitude !
Oh Lord , they're fighting !
Maybe until after Theseus's wedding day .
I won't argue with her , so her beautiful body won't disarm me. , Tonight , Iago .
Bad news , my lord .
Seven days and seven nights ?
You'll see shortly how the murderer wins the love of Gonzago's wife .
Honestly , she is too ill-tempered .
Showing mercy by pardoning killers only causes more murders .
I'd like to munch on some good dry oats .
Every one of us is a criminal .
And if he fails at that , he will find other ways to kill you .
Please forgive and forget .
I can't watch any more .
True , he has an excellent reputation .
Their lips , like four red roses on a stalk , touched .
Look , here are the boxes , prince .
Women are like roses : the moment their beauty is in full bloom , it's about to decay .
As eagerly as I ever came from school .
Arm myself ?
So , listen , Hermia .
What miracle will he work next ?
Be free and happy .
I used to love you .
A ship you sent me to find , to book passage out of here .
My lord , could I have a word with you ?
But if a man becomes weary of these obstacles , he can always kill himself .
She had no food today and will have none .
Maybe she was just naked in bed with him for an hour or so , but they didn't do anything .
My services are at your command .
I don't know .
First , Peter Quince , tell us what the play is about , then read the names of the actors , and then shut up .
Bassanio told him he'd try to hurry back .
Why do you need even one ?
God protect you from them and from other false friends !
Yes , boy .
As you please .
Oh , these men , these men !
It's my exercise time .
Then get to work , poison !
And to you , good sir .
Let them start something .
Messala , I have received these letters explaining that young Octavius and Mark Antony are rushing toward Philippi and bearing down upon us with a mighty power .
Isn't she proud of such a match ?
What's this all about ?
A daughter ?
It's born of my A witty mother !
If a man's brain were in his feet , wouldn't it be susceptible to frostbite ?
Here , sir ! " You stupid , unpolished dolts !
Sirs , I ask you to sleep in my tent .
Tell the Duke of Albany to prepare for war immediately .
Farewell .
Here , Peter Quince .
Come then , kiss me and take the last bit of warmth from my lips .
What's the problem ?
Oh I hope that's not true !
There were no primary ones .
Where's the king ?
No more foolish talk .
Please , I beg you , don't scold me .
As long as they didn't do anything , it would only be a minor sin .
I've been here too long .
I know it's foolish to be so much in love , but I can't help it .
As far as I'm concerned , what's past is done .
In every one of the lords ' households I have a servant paid to spy for me .
He used to praise his mother's nipple before he sucked it .
Stay , Jaques , stay here for a bit .
And be a happy mother by doing so .
What does this say ?
I didn't give her any ring .
Peter !
I don't wish that on you .
I sent for Cassio to come talk with you .
It is rather cold , indeed , my lord .
Crude slaves with greasy aprons , rulers , and hammers shall lift us up so everyone can see .
Well , I'll go to Scone .
Goodbye .
Relax , gentlemen .
What's the trouble ?
To whom ?
The most beautiful queen they ever had .
If I were my father , cousin , would I do this ?
Or , if you don't delay , make my wedding bed in the tomb where Tybalt lies .
Please , tell me some of them .
To me it looks like a weasel .
I'm going now .
This hasn't reached the level of an Egyptian feast yet .
Dissolute lowlife , you shall die .
That was a poor unlucky beggar .
Margaret , run into the sitting room .
I wish none of this had happened , given the situation here , and your rank .
I've come to say farewell to my king and master .
Run away , I beg you !
Another case : King Lewis the Tenth , who was sole heir to the usurper Capet , could not rest easy as king until he was assured that Queen Isabel , his grandmother , was a direct descendent of the Lady Ermengare , daughter of the aforementioned Charles duke of Lorraine , by which marriage the line of Charles the Great was reunited with the throne of France .
You haven't said anything against the Duke of Cornwall , have you ?
No , I didn't , but I did every night for the past year .
I swear by this hand and my father's soul , the whole thing is a disaster .
If I could make things better by lying , I'd deny it .
Absolutely , yes indeed .
Macbeth !
By God , I am not selfish when it comes to money : I don't care who eats at my expense .
Sir , he should have as many as Caesar has .
Then I'll tell you .
Now , Charmian !
Welcome , my lord .
As long as I'm alive , I'll be here .
Portia , what are you doing awake ?
He was a wreck , almost past hope .
We meant to tell the king that his orders have been carried out , and Rosencrantz and Guildenstern are dead .
When we're in love , we don't see with our eyes but with our minds .
Where's Antony ?
You drunken slave , I sent you for a rope , and I told you what to do with it .
I'll moan very believably. , Name the other actors. , But I'm really in the mood to play a tyrant .
Give it up and go drink .
A very nasty meaning .
He said , "Remember me." I swore I would .
We'll see about that !
I didn't think you would follow me .
Caesar , you thought this would happen .
Every second you delay is as long and dull as a journey to South Seas .
The news is true , my lord .
Do you lie still ?
God save the charitable organization !
Please let me prove you're a fool .
I will be brief because I'm not going to live long enough to tell a boring story .
We'll hurry .
To tell you the truth , they fought the new enemy with twice as much force as before ; they were like cannons loaded with double ammunition .
Moron !
This is It is , my lord .
Although you bring me joy , I can't take joy in this exchange of promises tonight .
He's been seen there many mornings , crying tears that add drops to the morning dew and making a cloudy day cloudier with his sighs .
Really , he's very witty , and full of wise sayings .
Tonight in Harfleur we will be your guest ; tomorrow we'll march on .
I'll listen to Cassius , and we will compare their reasons .
I'll run , devil .
Do you know who I am ?
It means peace and love and a quiet life , supremacy based on reverence and profound respect , and , not to go on and on about it , everything that's sweet and happy .
No , of course you don't .
Ever since the Duke's messenger visited Olivia , she's been upset .
Well , call them back again .
Romeo cried out , "Stop , my friends .
It's a long story , and tough to listen to .
Even though everything evil wants to look good , good still has to look good too .
Oh , please , I'm begging you , don't mention him again .
Well , the peace you pleaded for so eloquently just now lies in his answer .
She'll be damned for it .
Please let me go .
You and your fellow spirits did your last assignment well , and now I need your help again .
What do you want to do , Desdemona ?
But you had bad blood in you , no matter how much you learned , and good people couldn't stand to be near you .
You're less happy , being feared , than they are in fearing you .
Of course we will .
Come here , Tyrrel .
Bring us the letters .
Then say good-bye to me and tell me those tears were for my benefit .
I say "force" because Brutus would rather I stuck sharp blades and poisoned arrows in his ears than fill them with this .
When I send for you , come out wearing masks .
His name is Tyrrel , my lord .
I'll look for some way to leave his service .
I can't explain it .
God , I'm really sick .
Call in my maid .
Officers , take them away .
Young people often lose their self-control even without any help from others .
Is he still alive ?
I won't until I'm ready .
Order them to move back .
I think someone's coming from Venice .
He rests tonight within twenty-one miles of Rome .
She's a remarkable lady , if the rumors are to be believed .
And when is he leaving ?
We're to be married on Sunday .
Not me , believe me .
No , listen to it , Antony .
No .
Who does it stand still for ?
Welcome to Cyprus .
If I told you that , what would I get out of it ?
No , go ahead and take my life .
Speak to us .
But can I have some hope ?
Not a chance !
If it's me , there's no time as good as this hour of Caesar's death , and no weapon better than your swords , covered with the noblest blood in the world .
Get it , sister .
Well , I won't .
And whoever lives to see that day Will walk with his feet .
That's like building a bridge wider than the river it crosses .
If it weren't for the fact that so many of our soldiers revolted and joined them , we could have met them out in front of the castle , man to man , and beaten them back to England .
Come down , look no more .
You don't know whether it was wisdom or fear that made him flee .
Now please go in .
If you have poison for me , I'll drink it .
Authority .
I'd hate to waste my speech on the wrong person , because It's very well written and I spent a lot of time and energy memorizing it .
Tell me where you live .
We should rip off your man's clothing and show the world the woman who has represented her own kind so badly .
How do you know he loves her ?
I do .
I've never heard such confused emotions as what that Jew dog was shouting in the streets .
You would make a nasty suitor .
Don't worry about me. , Your sister and the duke are here .
Were you ever at court , shepherd ?
Hurry up , or I'll smack you on the ears with my sword before you have yours drawn .
Haven't you totally dismissed my honor and integrity in your anger ?
If Caesar chose , Antony would jump at the chance to be his friend .
I'm speaking purely in analogies and comparisons .
The evil that men do is remembered after their deaths , but the good is often buried with them .
Here , sir , as foolish as ever .
Say , uncle Richard , if my brother comes , where will I stay till my coronation ?
If he won't stop when he's told to , then he isn't one of the Prince's subjects .
You would run away from a bear , but if the only way to run was into the stormy ocean , you'd turn around and confront the bear .
Even if we don't fight foreign enemies , we'll beat down these rebels at home .
When you have to steal your own wives some day , I'll wait for you just as long .
The Phoenix is my house ?
No , keep going , old man ; don't stop like that .
What's he talking about ?
Your brothers ?
My lord , when I arrived at their home I gave them your letter .
What do you mean , beside yourself ?
Any obstacle or barrier to Claudio's happiness will be like medicine to me .
My forces are growing , and everything I know tells me it's all coming together .
And Juliet's just as much in love as he , but she has even less opportunity to meet her lover .
Good-bye .
He's a devil , a born devil , who can never be trained .
You have to read us the will , Caesar's will .
Therefore we'll have about half a dozen friends to the wedding , and that's it .
Oh , you men are made of stone !
I'll put up my shield and battle you .
Ah , dear Nature , my goddess , listen to me !
The princes left your daughter here for dead .
But she is now Mark Antony's wife .
Oh , good , a knife !
What would you do about it ?
The more I pray , the less I get out of it .
It's good we're doing this .
That you lift the death sentence on my servant , who killed a rowdy and belligerent former servant of the duke of Norfolk .
Why , dear child ?
Well that's good .
Whether your mouth is black or white , Do-dee , dee-dee da .
Picture the mayor and all his brother citizens dressed in their best as they go forth like senators of ancient Rome to welcome home their conquering Caesar .
Your Majesty is quite right .
Come , mistress Kate , I'll join you .
She's round , like a globe .
Look around you , Caesar .
She's a fine woman , all right .
What are you going to do ?
Grief seems to be contagious , for my eyes , seeing the tears in yours , began to fill .
Talk to the ambassadors who've just come back : ask them how majestically he responded to their message , how well supplied he was with good advisors , how restrained in expressing his displeasure , and , moreover , how terrifyingly firm he was in his resolve .
But if you didn't know about it , then you were wrong to get mad at us .
I'm coming , don't worry .
Is Scotland the same as when I left it ?
Gower is a good captain , and is well versed and well read in the wars .
May your sword be victorious and everything you do succeed .
Separate them .
I followed it here , or I should say it dragged me here .
Fool !
Yes , my lord .
Or was I dreaming ?
I won't either , sir .
Do you think I'd break my oath ?
He's lying dead in a ditch , with twenty deep gashes in his head , any one of which would have been enough to kill him .
Taste your legs , sir .
He leaves me to my own contentment , but that's the one thing I can not find .
Shall Kate be my wife ?
Listen , Fairy King .
What , are you afraid ?
Knock , knock , knock !
Nurse , will you come with me to my closet and help me pick out the clothes and the jewelry I'll need to wear tomorrow ?
When you avoid one trap , you fall into another .
If not , the Fates are on the side of the traitors .
What should we do about that ?
Or is he on his horse ?
It's as silent as a graveyard here .
Where is Polonius ?
It doesn't matter how I am : he hurt me , and that's that .
Although I can't make his ship disappear , I can still make his journey miserable .
We're probably a very valuable catch for these guys .
Let's play billiards .
I'll give my vile body back to the earth .
His arrow has pierced me too deeply , so I can't fly high with his cheerful feathers .
Ha !
Here comes Sir Oliver .
Here they come .
You once stole my position ; now you get to have the grief that goes with it .
Take some men and horses and go to her .
Brave Iago , how honest and trustworthy you are !
If you want to watch , follow me .
I'll do well .
It's still warm from the cut .
If he wakes up before we kill him , he'll never stop punishing us .
Excellent , very good .
Go be with your love , as it was decided at your wedding .
Today our hopes are at an end .
We'll do our duty to you , sir .
Go to him , petition him .
I watched him very closely .
If they aren't , they can go hang themselves by their own laces !
Oh !
I'm coming in peace .
So you're the only one who could play Pyramus .
I have to follow him and give him the letter .
They swore that you were sick with love for me .
So I thank you all , and I invite each and every one of you to come watch me be crowned king of Scotland at Scone .
Very nice to see you , sir .
What shall I do ?
About an hour for the ringing and fifteen minutes for the crying .
You're going to rest while you're still damned ?
We're sorry to hear this .
So I will , my liege .
God help me , I love you !
What did he do to you ?
You could have come sooner .
Your horn is a foot long , and I'm at least that size .
But please don't let any of your people wake me up .
Since your woes are only a portion of mine , I have every reason to surpass your lamentations and drown out your cries with my own .
You can command a beggar to bow on bended knee , but can you take possession of his health ?
A drum , a drum !
Edmund , where's your wicked brother ?
Everything that belongs to them is yours .
Friends , go .
Who said that I was disdainful , and that I got all my best lines out of a bad joke book ? !
It's a wonder you didn't lose your life and your mind all at once. , He's waking up .
Be my witness , oh you blessed moon .
Trinculo , speak politely .
And when you want to go to sleep , I'll be up laughing like a hyena .
Oh , how silly we are !
My master said it .
She went from me , who loved her with the dignity and devotion that suits a legitimate marriage , to a wretch whose natural gifts were poor compared to mine .
I knew from the first it would be this way .
It will likely be a bloody fight .
How can a tailor make a person ?
What's going on , my love ?
On my life I swear to you that your youngest daughter doesn't love you least .
With all my heart .
That young man who was just here .
I don't hear anything , madam .
So let me be brief here .
If you could , you couldn't bring him back to life .
You're right , I'll go quietly .
Oh , you evil woman !
Come on , good fellow , help me into that armor you're carrying .
There has never been a widow who suffered such loss as me .
He's too overwhelmed with shame .
The Hero that died !
Romeo ran away when Tybalt fell dead .
Tell the king what was happening in the battle when you left it .
You bastards !
So be it .
Virtue is beauty , but someone beautiful and wicked is like an empty box decorated by the devil .
I'll write down what she says , so I'll remember it better .
Yes , very well , sir .
I hope to God Othello's all right .
What did he say the symptoms were ?
That's all I wanted to know .
Maybe she can't find him .
Say something .
Is that what you've heard ?
Believe me on my honor and keep my honor in mind , so you may believe me .
We're still just beginners when it comes to crime .
What's there to say ?
And , as the speaker of any prologue should , I ask you to hear our play courteously and to judge it kindly .
So , she's in on this too !
Why , are we turning to men ?
Yes sir , thank God .
If we lose , what do you plan to do ?
How many wonderful creatures there are here !
It's lovely to see you .
Yes , indeed , bring them before me .
There's no need to be , really , for , You're my teacher , so I must believe you .
Where did you hear this ?
But you promise you can keep a secret ?
Good sir ,
Catch me if you can !
No gentlemen , don't get ready to go now .
No , we'll all go there to bring him .
While I waited , I'd frown impatiently , and perhaps wind my watch , or play with my , with some expensive piece of jewelry I happen to be wearing .
Who are you ?
Crazy" I'm calling it , since how can you say what craziness is except to say that it's craziness ?
You can have anything you want .
Sad or happy ?
But I won't sleep till I get back .
His lips were nice and red , a little more lively and passionate than the red that was in his cheeks , one was pure red and the other more pink .
No , let me say some good things about you while I'm in the mood .
But only hint at this vaguely , because , as you know , my mother's still alive .
This will either make us or break us .
Come here , man .
Amen to that .
Oh , good judge !
My good man Norfolk , hurry to your post .
Clink your cups together in a toast !
I have money in my purse and property at home , so I'm off to see the world .
Indeed , I would have such an exploit for you , Ligarius , if you were healthy enough to hear it .
Not if the minor ones come up first .
Yes , Shylock , I'll sign the contract and agree to its terms .
I don't know , except they are busy with some phony guarantee .
We need to stay away from each other until midnight tomorrow .
Let it end , or let me die so I won't have to watch any more of it .
Now , I'm very pleased with it being outdoors , but in its not being at the court , it is boring .
You're not responsible for my death and my father's , and I'm not responsible for yours .
Yes , but who is he ?
Goodbye to you both .
He once said the devil would get him because of women .
He'll have to kill both of us , and indeed we're both men .
Yes , I know her age down to the hour .
This must be some kind of fairyland .
In suicide , gods allow tyrants to be defeated .
I'm a man , my lady , that God has made for himself to ruin .

I have quarreled four times , and almost got in a fight .
Stand and fight , you overdressed servant , fight !
Oh , dear God , please help him !
Adieu , good Mr. Depression .
Goodbye .
I could do more to help Antony , but to do so would insult him .
Take him off to jail !
Didn't they pass by you ?
What do you mean , "wears the wreath" ?
I came to Venice with a number of Antonio's creditors who say he won't be able to avoid going bankrupt .
Go back to bed .
I'll stop by before you go to bed , and tell you what I've heard .
Excuse me , sir. , Tom's chilly .
But you'd still be gorgeous even if you were as proud as the devil .
Well , I'll get married one day , just to see .
I could do it easily now .
I believe it .
That's another bad deal I've made ! , a bankrupt , a spendthrift , who now has to hide his head on the Rialto , a beggar who used to look so smug in front of the other merchants .
The king was wearing exactly this armor when he fought the king of Norway .
I saw you at Count Orsino's recently .
Leave him alone .
What kind of man are you ?
Madam , please be patient .
I could really use his advice right now .
He is definitely not there , sir .
Summertime in Verona has no flower as fine as him .
Who says he is ?
Yes , it's true , sir .
All right .
I know that Regan will taste just like Goneril , both of them sour crabapples .
You mean an officer ?
She will be the bond that joins our kingdoms and our hearts .
They're more like how you would act if you were a woman telling a scary story by the fireside in front of her grandmother .
In England this strange monster would be just like a man .
No , not at all , sir .
You don't love me .
Not good ones , please .
Will you say grace , sweet Kate , or shall I ? , What is this ?
You don't need a ghost returning from the grave to tell you that , sir .
My heart adores him , even though my tongue curses him .
My lord , most humbly on bended knee I beg you to grant me the leading of the vanguard .
One last thing , and this is up to you .
I think he told me Paris was about to marry Juliet .
Everything's out of control .
I hope God keeps that monster from growing in Othello's mind !
These corpses suggest mayhem .
Get it ready immediately .
Tonight I received a letter from my sister telling me all about them , and warning me not be at home in case they come to stay at my house .
Call them .
Not me .
Where's Monsieur Mustardseed ?
Me , sir ?
Why didn't the jerk come back to me when I called him ?
So it's not my business that's making me sad .
Dark as hell , Sir Topas .
If that's true , it's a serious fault , and Caesar has paid seriously for it .
The gentleman who serves you only for profit And is only superficially loyal to you Will take off when it starts to rain And leave you alone in the storm .
This is the day I'm going to get what I wished for when I wished that the person I most trusted would betray me .
That you love my daughter to spite your soul .
Wow , he's a real devil .
Shall we go see this fortification , men ?
Leave it alone , you fool .
Tomorrow is Wednesday .
Thank God I'm not a woman and afflicted with all the giddiness that troubles that entire sex .
You should know , my loving lord , I've heard that the marquess Dorset has fled to Brittany , to the earl of Richmond .
He could never bear carnation .
What's happening now , Lucillius ?
Father , wife , friends , farewell !
And Rosencrantz !
I wish to God that the golden crown that I'll have to wear were red-hot steel and burned me straight through to the brain !
No , my dearest love , I wouldn't cheat you for the whole world .
I've told you .
I know I will too , if it's the last thing I do .
The night air is too raw and cold for us to stay outdoors .
Please don't say no .
As you wish , sir .
I'll follow the priest and go with you ; and after I've sworn to be faithful , I'll be faithful forever .
I think you're my mirror , not my brother .
Again , good night , kind lords and gentlemen .
